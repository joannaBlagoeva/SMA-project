Gabriel lead Sam like a lamb to slaughter with the horseman ring idea knowing what would happen if they were successful regardless of his belief that it would never actually happen and the world would always end. Now they both know what that plan costs.   Gabriel wanted redemption Asmodeus puts that pretty plainly. Gabriel got his just desserts and he doesn‚Äôt want to play trickster anymore. For just a brief moment he and Castiel talk about a future where he owns up to his mistakes and goes home to make things right and while he doesn‚Äôt verbally agree the telling part is that he doesn‚Äôt say no. Gabriel wants to be better and it starts with the Winchesters.   And in the end he instead gets to watch Lucifer be everything he‚Äôs not. He watches Lucifer save everyone. Save Sam.   The violation of it all to be stripped of his only purpose here and watch the torturer tote around like the hero and impart this on Jack watch Sam force a smile and play tough like he isn‚Äôt still shuddering with the touch of Lucifer denying him autonomy to make him his plaything. Up until two weeks ago that was still Gabriel at the hands of Asmodeus.   He‚Äôs made to watch it because he‚Äôs not strong enough to do anything about it.
