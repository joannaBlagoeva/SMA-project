Jared did a great job showing Sam’s guilt and how a victim might blame themselves without being given the dialogue or storylines to express or explain it.   But god it irks me. And I’m so emotional about it.   (I know I last posted about my rewatch back in like April or March. But I stopped watching right before tombstone and just couldn’t bring myself to go any further because well Cas was alive and everyone was together. The idea of going further seeing more people’s deaths and reliving the pain and seeing more pain. And I considered just starting over.

Especially now that you know intimately exactly how all of that would have happened to Sam because now it’s happened to you too. No one deserves that it was not just desserts. Gabriel lead Sam like a lamb to slaughter with the horseman ring idea knowing what would happen if they were successful regardless of his belief that it would never actually happen and the world would always end. Now they both know what that plan costs.   Gabriel wanted redemption Asmodeus puts that pretty plainly. Gabriel got his just desserts and he doesn’t want to play trickster anymore. For just a brief moment he and Castiel talk about a future where he owns up to his mistakes and goes home to make things right and while he doesn’t verbally agree the telling part is that he doesn’t say no. Gabriel wants to be better and it starts with the Winchesters.   And in the end he instead gets to watch Lucifer be everything he’s not. He watches Lucifer save everyone. Save Sam.   The violation of it all to be stripped of his only purpose here and watch the torturer tote around like the hero and impart this on Jack watch Sam force a smile and play tough like he isn’t still shuddering with the touch of Lucifer denying him autonomy to make him his plaything. Up until two weeks ago that was still Gabriel at the hands of Asmodeus.   He’s made to watch it because he’s not strong enough to do anything about it. He can’t save anyone he can’t save Sam he can’t even save himself.   I’d kill myself too.', 'Dazzling gorgeous!!(Profile:eyes nose mouth ears).. Complete package..❤️\\u200d🔥❤️\\u200d🔥❤️\\u200d🔥']\n"
