So sorry for the deadness in my own writing things have been a bit hard to sit down and write but Dungeon Meshi and especially Laios have been inspiring me a lot! For this post I will start with it being pretty simple with some headcanons that came to mind! He really is rotting my brain a lot.  CW: Fluff sort of suggestive when talking about sexuality but that‚Äôs literally it.   Something I‚Äôve seen shared and I totally agree with is that Laios I feel would feel more inclined to fall for someone who is a bit of an outsider or someone he can relate to and bond with in some way  Similar the person would have to have a love for monsters/animals because I truly cannot see it that he would be into someone who would hate them when he loves them so dearly I also view him to be a bit demisexual I feel like he‚Äôd need a bond in some way or to know the person at least a little bit to want to be with someone like that. I could definitely see him being Bi as well! Once he realizes he had fallen for someone though? He falls hard. Will he make it really obvious though? No not really but also yes. It really depends but for him it would be a lot of ‚Äòsubtle‚Äô things for himself. Like wanting to be close to the other person a lot for example.  He also likes being able to be affectionate in some way even if it isn‚Äôt explicitly affection. From holding your hands to resting his hands against you wherever he can his hand brushing against your hands etc.  He really is the epitome of a golden retriever bf but are we really surprised? It‚Äôs Laios. Likes to info dump a lot and tell you things even if it may be something you already know let him talk,2024-07-07 19:57:43 GMT

He said it‚Äôs bc Laios paid him up front and he felt he couldn‚Äôt leave (I believe he just cared too much and wanted to genuinely help he‚Äôs just using that as an excuse-). But if they‚Äôre MARRIED???  Oh. My. God. Just. Imagine the reveal on that later.  And the talk with the orc lady. She‚Äôs mad he‚Äôs gonna lie to them imagine if she found out they‚Äôre married. He ain‚Äôt just wanting to lie he wanna lie to his HUSBAND. The fury she gonna have yall‚Ä¶  And then the reveal to Marcille. You think she was shocked at him having had a wife and kids??? Girl he married to your girl best friend‚Äôs brother. Your whole ass PARTY LEADER.  And lbr Shuro gonna probably only be MILDLY shocked because him sharing a room with Laios makes sense under that lens. Hindsight and shit.  Senshi probably just gonna go ‚Äúhuh. Yeah guess that makes sense.‚Äù  Izutsumi probably knew from them smelling like each other lbr here.  But then Kabru‚Äôs party. Yall. Imagine Mickbell‚Äôs goddamn reaction.

I am still very much obsessed with this show and am super excited that the show was renewed for season 2.  I will be doing reprints of the Wolves and Dustrag tees because quite a few people missed out on the first drop and asked if there would be another chance to snag them. I am a pushover and al3ways happy to comply so this is your guys‚Äô chance!Many of the stickers are also reprints but I also included the elf Senshi Falin with a gun and Tummy Ache Survivor because why not.  The charms are probably what I am most excited about since the familiar ones will have magnets so you and your besties can connect them all together. Almost like a friendship charm! And I especially love the Falin shaker charm a little dark but I kinda get a giggle out of it.  Please note that since these are PRE ORDERS once they are closed it will still be a bout 4 to 5 weeks before I start putting the orders together and mailing out all out. I do plan to have it open for a little Oliver a week but if I get an influx of orders and feel like it may be too much for me to handle I will close them prematurely. I will let you all know 24 hours in advance if that is the case.  Thank you again for all your our support and encouragement.

Verdict: MUNCH  Boiled Mimic: Literally just crab. Marcille its literally just a crab.  Verdict: MUNCH  Looted Grain Porridge: ehhh. I prefer my grains ground into flour and baked. Would eat the mimic meat though as previously covered.  Verdict: DUMP  Grilled Parasite: once again. Soy sauce. Though I‚Äôd at least try the parasite itself.   Verdict: MUNCH experimentally  Grilled Kelpie: oh FUCK yes. I‚Äôve always wanted to try horse meat and here‚Äôs a whole variety platter! Going after the fillet most of all and the tail for the novelty.  Verdict: MUNCH  Tentacle and Kelpie Stew: I love a good meaty stew‚Ä¶ while I‚Äôm unsure what texture tentacles would have whatever texture they would have would be homogenized by being stewed so it doesn‚Äôt really matter.  Verdict: MUNCH  Tentacle Gnocci: oh FUCK yeah pasta. Putting things in ravioli (or similar) is one of the #1 ways to make me eat it. Once again texture doesn‚Äôt matter I‚Äôm fucking these UP  Verdict: MUNCH  Pre-Dragon Cutlets: never had frog before but I am VERY eager to try. The red wine + onion is a big bonus.

She doesn‚Äôt want to die but at least this way she doesn‚Äôt have to see her friends die before her.  Falin being racked with guilt. Marcille is one of the most important people to her. People thinks she‚Äôs the more calm headed of the Touden‚Äôs but she‚Äôd try to go back so quickly. Laios supports her of course. Maybe Toshiro says he‚Äôll help to get into Falin‚Äôs favor and thinks Falin would wait until he returned with help (only to come back to hear she already went in).  Falin who is usually so placid being driven with a desperation to get Marcille back. The party knew she would be affected but they didn‚Äôt know it would be this much.   The main points go the same- the dragon is defeated and Marcille is bones. Falin‚Äôs specialty is healing + the body and soul and with how close she is with Marcille she knows about the resurrection ritual. Her devotion to putting everything back in place.  Marcille is back but of course it all goes to shit.  Chimera Marcille with black feathers similar to her Dungeon Lord look.  Falin taking her place and the Winged Lion being so disappointed. Almost all of Falin‚Äôs desires are second hand desires of others. The only real desire of any kind of substance is her desire for Laios and Marcille to be safe. The Lion is frustrated or confused because surly she should desire something for herself. As another user @yarrayora  mentioned Falin would be more like a seasoning instead of an actual meal. The Lion would be quick to discard her once he got what he wanted.  Maybe it‚Äôs just cause we got so little of Falin in the actual story but I would love her self sacrificing tendencies/people pleasing and what her actual drives and desires outside of other people were explored more.,2024-07-08 01:32:16 GMT

7,Dungeon Meshi,['delicious in dungeon'  'dmbb24'],dunmeshbigbang,What‚Äôs a Big Bang? It‚Äôs a fandom event where authors and artists are paired up to create a work together. This specific event is technically a ‚ÄòMini‚Äô Bang as written works are only required to be 10000 words long at minimum. They can be longer.   Does the art need to be drawn? Nope! Art of all varieties and mediums is allowed so long as it‚Äôs finished. Do you want to write some sheet music? Do that! Want to craft a tea blend based on the vibes of the story? Do that! Want to write a few recipes and channel your inner monster chef? Do that! Art is art!   How does it work? On July 14th a google form will be posted for you to fill out. Please fill it out once for EACH entry you plan on doing. (So if you plan on doing two stories fill it out as an author twice. If you plan on doing a story and an art fill it out once as an artist and once as an author.)   Then our authors will begin to craft their stories as well as their summaries. Before August 9th authors will update staff with a progress report and their summaries. On August 9th summaries will be posted for artists to look through. On August 12th artists will be able to send in an email with their TOP 5 choices. Groups will be assigned on a first come first serve basis until everyone is assigned to a group. From there artists and authors will update the staff as per the dates listed via email. Prior to December 8th staff will reach out to discuss post dates. From December 8th until all stories are posted one story will be posted per day.   What goes in the summary? The summary should include what rating your story will be what ships will be included (if any. Gen fics are totally welcome!) and a typical story summary like you‚Äôd post on AO3. Please also include the language! You don‚Äôt need to include a title just a basic summary.   Where is all this happening? All official communication will happen via our email. We may post to tumblr/twitter/reddit for general updates and information sharing.    Where will it be posted? That‚Äôs up to you! We will have a collection started on AO3 that you are welcome to add your story to. Please just make sure it is posted somewhere public so the staff team can properly advertise it when you do post!   Does the art need to just be inspired by the story or should it be more related? The more related the better! You are making art FOR the story.   Can I make more than one? You are allowed to officially sign up for four groups two as an author and two as an artist. You are welcome to do more than one piece of art for a single fic though and you are welcome to write as long of a fic as you can finish in the time frame. Please do not spread yourself too thin!   Can I co-write/co-art with someone? Yep! Just sign up together using a single form.   Can I be anonymous? Sure I suppose? You‚Äôll need to be able to communicate with your group and you‚Äôll need to send emails to the staff team but you don‚Äôt need to directly link your own private social media. Just give us some way to credit you on your hard work!   Does my work need to be finished? Yes.   Can it be part of a larger story? Yes but no? It should be a full fledged work of art on its own. And it must be fully finished by the post date. This means all chapters.   What if I can‚Äôt finish on time? Please let us know ASAP so we can work something out with you. We will either give you an extension or reassign your group to another group. Life happens! We get it!,2024-07-08 03:31:14 GMT

Laois: the overly obsessed fan over at the merch center critically thinking whether the anatomy is off on characters solely for the fact that he is bored of waiting for his friends to get their pictures taken by people. Then he gets really into anything he actually knows and tells you EVERY DETAIL of why a print is so good at this particular stand.   You end up having to wait on Laois after everything because he keeps thinking and talking about that particular merch stand.   Reliable for holding stuff not reliable for his constant change in location and need to touch cosplays despite everyone telling him no. The cosplayers don‚Äôt mind since Laois is not sexualizing them but often admiring their big props and asks questions that delight others to answer.     Marcielle: A person who loved the idea of cosplaying her favorite character and actually being them (horribly trying to act before giving up) only to realize she is the only cosplayer in the group and now she has to deal with people wanting her photo (she is proud yet shy and exhausted by the idea but has put too much effort into it already).   She constantly stares at any companion cosplayer wishing to take a picture with them but being unable to do so then she stares then she stops staring because she realizes that she was. Ensue embarrassment for the rest of the day.     Senshi: the backpack man with everything from snacks to sewing needles to absolutely ridiculous amounts of water bottles. He basically lives at conventions and enjoys helping people out.   He is knowledgeable enough to do a panel about nearly anything that is basic knowledge but he feels better helping people physically rather than just teaching‚Ä¶.he likes people passionate about things so he doesn‚Äôt know much about any hot topics in media at the moment he just enjoys atmosphere and likes to cook even in hotels. He is happiest when everyone is eating and retelling the highlights of the day.     Chilchuk: the veteran who manages to corral the group solely on his ability to multitask. He is someone who scopes out the area for food places and ends up getting hotel tickets since the others are unreliable in his eyes. Along with being a retail manager who pinches pennies and scoffs at every absurdly strange purchase his friends make he has the most fun watching people and still enjoys the scarier and complex cosplays he sees.   He has a soft spot for idols because sometimes his daughters used to go to conventions and he would always take a picture to show his girls when he got home‚Ä¶.he also gets a souvenir if it‚Äôs in his budget.   Izutsumi: Cat girl by trade but not by heart (behaves like one but never buys any cat items instead is gifted them frequently) she is the type of person to stare at something she wants for a while then walking around before going back to buy it later.   She records any bullshit that happens on her phone for fun and is the type of girl that often wants to do anything that has competition (fake sword fights martial arts Parkour training stunt man behind the scenes racing etc‚Ä¶) Anything that has a chance to be violent she wants to watch or participate.   She is also the sore loser of the group and the one who voices her opinions directly. Not afraid of venturing on her own and catching up with the group later when she wants to.      Falin: Every group members dumb nerd who is interested in a little of everything. Money is tight so she tries to trade items and often ends up actually succeeding.   She sometimes sells art but often forgets to do a lot of things for the booth so she decided to enjoy being a vendor of weird things she makes.   Out of the group she is the most directionally challenged yet somehow ends up where she needs to be at the right time (right answer wrong equation person but with directions). She can be a mom at times and the child at others. She is also the one who often asks to take pictures of people but all of them are terrible so someone else takes a picture for her in the group.     Who is always hungry in the group? Izutsumi because she wanders off the most and often comes back solely to get food from Senshi but Marcielle is a quick second with how much she gets into things and forgets to feed herself.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Who drives everyone there?  Falin weirdly enough despite her directional horrors but she is okay since Laios helps her‚Ä¶.(they both get turned around however if they are in a deep discussion and miss a turn if no one else is in the car yet) and on occasion Chilchuck when he is farthest from the convention or wants to control when they leave. Also Marcielle is no longer allowed to drive them after she almost got them killed because she thought there was a squirrel on the road.     Who buys the most stuff? 1. Marcielle (no contest has many Fandom and has a weak self control if left alone)  2. Laois (often buys strange things that cost more than they should has a high standard for items despite their strangeness)  3. Izutsumi (anything that is of interest to her she buys and often doesn‚Äôt have a money limit)  4. Falin (Doesn‚Äôt buy anything much she likes looking the most but she likes to buy smaller things and collects fun car stickers)  5. Chilchuck (Learned from the past and limits his spending. He doesn‚Äôt spend much on food but occasionally finds an item that piques his interest).  6. Senshi (Only buys food the items are just nice to look at but he doesn‚Äôt need things to know what he likes he only likes practical things)     What are their favorite items they‚Äôve bought from a convention: Laois: A fake Minotaur ring that you can put on your nose that is proportionally sized with Celtics markings  Falin: A collection of stickers involving a florally looking dragon dropping flowers from a small basket it is on her bumper across the whole thing.  Marcielle: A beautiful hand crafted wooden staff of her favorite character. It is the only prop she owns that was not made by her or a friend.   Senshi: A blank cookbook that is covered with tree animals and plants from front to back with its own holder to help keep the book open.  Izutsumi: A real black metaled ninja sword she got that has red markings and and has an engraving of her family name.  Chilchuck: An idol print that his little girls love that he had signed and framed for his kids‚Äô 13th and 11th respective birthdays.     If lost where would you find them at? Laois: Artist Alley gabbing up to anyone about their art  Marcielle: At any panel involving her interest that is informational  Izutsumi: Gaming Room or a room with a contest. Occasionally is just sitting on the floor in a hallway.  Falin: Merch/Vendor room constantly looking and talking to other artists  Senshi: How-to or 101 sessions about crafting if none available then he is in the viewing room.  Chilchuck: Often watches performances. If bored with them he goes into the viewing rooms with Senshi. Both just commenting on how anime has changed or having nostalgia on how things used to be in their day.     Whose feet start hurting first? Marcielle by far she isn‚Äôt used to standing but she walks all around the merch tables in cosplay so it‚Äôs a bit heavier on her too so sitting isn‚Äôt an option much.     If they held a panel what would they all do?  Laois - The Best and Worst of Fantasy Creatures (Anatomy edition)   Marcielle - How to Make Elf Ears 101  Senshi - Fantasy Meal Guide (the Do‚Äôs and Dont‚Äôs of Cooking Unknown Recipes)  Izutsumi - Ninja Training (A Crash Course)  Falin - Drawing Dragons (and Other Fantasy Creatures)  Chilchuk - Rating Your Cosplays (Not for the faint of heart!),2024-07-08 04:17:47 GMT

The Mad Mage and Falin‚Äôs encounter with the Canaries had left him badly injured.   Recommend watching all 24 episodes of Dungeon Meshi anime or manga up to 51 beforehand. Alternative story and events to Manga chapters 53-56 and 62.  POV: Tallchuck      &lt;!-- more --&gt; Izutsumi as a kobold dives into her dumplings and makes them disappear. She is becoming less picky now that she‚Äôs part dog. The now tallest member of the party couldn‚Äôt taste each individual flavor of the meat as distinctly as when he was a halfling but the savory taste is great regardless. To think the strange mushrooms can change creatures down to the muscles and cells. Chilchuck finishes his meal and feels unsatisfied. Makes sense because a tallman would need to eat a lot more calories than a halfling. At six and a half feet tall he guessed he‚Äôs probably three times the weight he was as a halfling. There‚Äôs no point worrying about gaining weight and springing traps cause he‚Äôs obviously way too heavy already as a tallman. He asks for seconds. The party stops briefly noticing his act making him feel self conscious. Senshi as an elf looks overjoyed and fills his plate with more dumplings.   ‚ÄúYou have grown so much. Please make sure to eat your fill.‚Äù He said in a sweet feminine yet to Chilchuck also unnerving voice.  ‚ÄúHey. I want some too.‚Äù Laios protests. Laios as a plump dwarf would probably eat the same amount as his normal tallman form Chilchuck figured.  ‚ÄúYou can have mine. I‚Äôm already full.‚Äù Marcille now a tiny halfling gives her leftovers to Laios. Chilchuck continues to eat agitated that he is being stared at by everyone in the party. He‚Äôs not used to standing out. He sighs. ‚ÄúSo as I am now it looks like I can‚Äôt do my job properly anymore. Marcille I am going to have to guide you though disabling step traps as we encounter them.‚Äù  Laios buds in. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right Chilchuck. I was thinking that we will have to reassign our roles in the party until we get our normal bodies back. I‚Äôm going to teach you some close combat.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI can also teach you magic!‚Äù Marcille piped in. Damn it Chilchuck thought. He had hoped they would forget about their last battle debacle.  ‚ÄúHey that‚Äôs too much at once!‚Äù He pointed at Senshi. ‚ÄúYou should teach the elf magic!‚Äù Senshi drops the pot he was cleaning. The elf‚Äôs arms curled into his delicate chest. He stammers.  ‚ÄúYou know how I feel about magic. I.. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with it at all. I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶ you all may have changed but I‚Äôm still the same on the inside.‚Äù He pleads to them with tearful innocent doe eyes. Everyone could not help but leer at him in disbelief. Laios the ever present optimist breaks the silence.  ‚ÄúWe are going to have to adapt as best as we can. Let‚Äôs for now clean up the dishware and then look over our inventory to see what weapons will work best in our new bodies.‚Äù  Not too long after cleaning up Chilchuck looked over all the weapons in his possession. Throwing knives. That could work but will run out if they can‚Äôt be recovered. Blade knife and bowie knife. He knew Laios would say that because of the aggro his large form will receive in combat longer blades such as swords would work better. Knives are meant for surprise stabs like Kabru‚Äôs attack on Falin as a chimera. Lastly the bow. He won‚Äôt be able to use it. His hand practically enveloped it. It looks like a child‚Äôs- Oh hell no! All his adult life he‚Äôs been working to not be seen as a kid from the other races! How dare that creep into his head now that he‚Äôs been tallman for just a few hours!  ‚ÄúLights out.‚Äù Senshi calls to him from behind. The beastly dwarf turned into a paper thin shadow of himself struggles to drag his ax to him. ‚ÄúBorrow this and protect us.‚Äù Senshi gazes up at him like a princess at her champion. A breeze seemed to be coming from somewhere blowing his long black curly locks. Willing to do anything to get out of this awkward moment Chilchuck reluctantly accepts the gift. There‚Äôs no way I can fight with this shoddy thing.  Seeing that there was little else to do Chilchuck undoned Laios‚Äô borrowed armor and settled into his blankets to sleep. Thankfully Izutsumi seems to be bothering someone else tonight. Everything sounds so calm and quiet as he drifts off.  ‚ÄúChilchuck!‚Äù  ‚ÄúWha!‚Äù The tallman startles awake. ‚ÄúLaios‚Ä¶ lights out.‚Äù Chilchuck growls.  ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs no problem for me. I can see in the dark now that I‚Äôm a dwarf.‚Äù Laios laughs obnoxiously.  ‚ÄúGo to bed Laios!‚Äù Marcille calls out from the darkness obviously annoyed. Laios tones down into a whisper.   ‚ÄúSo I was thinking about what can be used to aid you fight and I remembered that when I started out fighting monsters I used a shield. That should distract the monsters while the rest of us take it down. I recovered my old shield from the floor we first fought the dragon in and I‚Äôll let you have it. I don‚Äôt know if we will have much time to practice-‚Äù  ‚ÄúI can still hear you Laios! Shut up and go to sleep already!‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry! Marcille!‚Äù Laios sets down his shield next to him. ‚ÄúI will leave this here for you. Everything is going to be fine. We will make it work.‚Äù he reassures Chilchuck in a cheery tone.  A worry seed plants firmly in Chilchuck‚Äôs mind. He had very little direct combat experience. Heck Kabru and his party had way more experience than him and how many times did his party find them dead these past few days? It‚Äôs gonna be the mimics all over again except Marcille can‚Äôt revive anymore cause she‚Äôs a halfling. Nothing good will come of this.  The next morning fully geared up Chilchuck holds the ax and the shield up for Laios.  ‚ÄúThis ax is meant for two hands.‚Äù Chilchuck tries to use any excuse not to take up a new responsibility. Laios comes up to him handing him his sword.  ‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs switch. I‚Äôll take the ax.‚Äù Chilchuck hesitates knowing that there is a monster inside the handle to that sword. It had transformed from the changelings too becoming a kitsch looking skull and bat wings sword. A light emits from the edge of the blade.   A question emerged in his thoughts Don‚Äôt you want to fight monsters head on too?   No. I don‚Äôt.  On the other side of the camp Marcille draws a heat spell inscription on the stone floor while Izutsumi and Senshi watch. Izutsumi pokes her head into the spell inscription sniffing the charcoal lines with her big dog nose.  ‚ÄúIzutsumi move. This is going to get hot.‚Äù Little halfling Marcille pushes the giant dog girl away as best she can. She looks up to Senshi. ‚ÄúSee I already drew the spell. Elves naturally have a lot of mana. All I need for you to do is tap it here with my staff and channel the energy of fire.‚Äù  Senshi glumly takes the staff.   ‚ÄúWell if it‚Äôs to make tea‚Ä¶‚Äù He taps it. The lines turn red and fire erupts from it sending sparks everywhere. The three scream out and bolt away.  ‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre doing!? That was too strong!‚Äù Izutsumi yells. Laios attention turns over to them and heads over. While he‚Äôs distracted this is a good opportunity to inspect the sword. Chilchuck searched through the gaps in the hilt to find tiny changeling mushrooms growing inside. Disgusting. He will probably need to check his clothing and person to make sure there aren‚Äôt more of them. For only a moment a gooey creature with snail eyes peeks out at him and sinks back into the sword.  ‚ÄúThere you are you little bastard.‚Äù It‚Äôs time to get rid of this nonsense before someone gets hurt. Chilchuck takes out a matchstick and lights under the area where the monster was hidden. The spores burn easily causing the living armor monster to push out in an attempt to escape. The flame causes the slimy surface of the creature to boil. Its eyes dissolve into its body as it cooks. He knew it was just an unintelligent monster but it seems to curse him as it shrivels up. You‚Äôre not immune. Suddenly Chilchuck falls over from being tackled from behind.  ‚ÄúStop! What are you doing to Kensuke?!‚Äù Laios yells. The dwarf seizes back his sword and holds it like a baby. ‚ÄúKensuke are you still there? Kensuke!‚Äù he cries.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm killing it for your own good! You should have done that ages ago!‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut he helped us get through the door‚Ä¶‚Äù Laios sniffs. Marcille steps in.  ‚ÄúLaios having that monster around was nagging at me too. You can‚Äôt keep it forever.‚Äù   ‚ÄúListen to your elders Laios.‚Äù Senshi said in support. Thank god the rest of the party understands reason. Laios pauses and lifts the sword up in a moment of introspection. Chilchuck could not confirm if he had fully killed the monster. Laios gets up and addresses him solemnly.  ‚ÄúUnderstood Mr. Chilchuck sir. It won‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù  That‚Äôs new. He had never had Laios behave that formally to him. Laios did not give the sword back to him meaning the bug was probably still alive but whatever. It‚Äôs damaged enough that it won‚Äôt be moving or peeking out for the rest of the time they are here.  They continue on to an enclosed castle wall level with multiple passage ways. There‚Äôs no monster encounters for several hours. Chilchuck anticipates his lack of senses getting in the way of moving past this level. Everyone feels tired and hungry. Laios suggests everyone to take a break to discuss what to do next.  ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs different. We have made no progress since going through the door. What has changed? ‚Äù Laios asks.  ‚ÄúI have read about dungeons that are an endless empty maze instead of environments full of monsters. Maybe the Mad Mage changed his strategy? We got so far down here by eating monsters to sustain us. Something must have happened to scare him enough to change from offense to defense. ‚Äù suggests Marcille.  ‚ÄúWhat a cheap trick. He intends to starve us.‚Äù Izutsumi adds.  ‚ÄúThat is a shame. I was hoping to see what monsters would be at the lowest level‚Ä¶ What are we going to eat-!‚Äù Laios eyes widen and he points to Senshi‚Äôs head. It had changeling mushrooms growing out of it. The group scrambles away from him. Senshi picks one from the top of his head.  ‚ÄúCheck yourselves and put every mushroom you find in the pot. I suppose we will have to make due with this.‚Äù he says.  Turned out there were mushrooms growing all over. Inside their bags. Behind their ears. The less than savvy areas the mushrooms were found were burned in the fireplace. Izutsumi rolls on her side inspecting herself in bent poses only a cat-dog beastling can do.  ‚ÄúGross! Gross! Gross!‚Äù she growls.  Senshi wet down the mushrooms and cut them. He boils the water in a pot adds dry merman seaweed salt and the mushrooms. The changeling mushroom miso soup went down good enough but it was eaten more out of desperation than anything. Laios smiles cheerfully to lighten the situation.  ‚ÄúI should have saved Kensuke for this soup. He could have tasted pretty good with it. I apologize for not stating my intentions sooner.‚Äù   Wanting to clear the air Chilchuck admits to Laios ‚ÄúI overstepped my boundaries. I am hired to disable traps and find the quickest safest passage. Not destroy whatever treasures you find living or nonliving.‚Äù It‚Äôs not in my contract to do close combat too unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary but this dungeon dive has had many deviations from the norm.   ‚ÄúIf you did bring that living armor monster back to the surface what would you have done with it? Have it as a pet?‚Äù Marcille smirks.  ‚ÄúWell since everyone thinks living armor is a spell it would be a huge discovery. I could have put it in a monster scholar laboratory to see how it works and published a paper about it. I‚Äôm not good at writing so either you or Farlin would have to proofread and edit.‚Äù Laios explains to her. Marcille laughs.   ‚ÄúThe elvin libraries are so huge I am very confident that living armor monsters are already well documented in their beastaries.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI wonder if a dwarf like me can visit this library to see if that‚Äôs true?‚Äù  You are already addressing yourself as a dwarf‚Ä¶ The rest of them thought.   Laios reads their discomfort and says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just as well I don‚Äôt visit. I like more hands-on work fighting dungeon monsters anyway.‚Äù Izutsumi looks down at her bowl full of disapproval.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to find my own food!‚Äù she exclaims as she darts out.  ‚ÄúIzuuuutsuuuumi!‚Äù Senshi calls out to her dramatically then sighs.   ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be back. There‚Äôs nothing here.‚Äù Chilchuck reassures him. Senshi clears his throat.   ‚ÄúI have been contemplating our recent stroke of bad luck. I think the dungeon itself has lost interest in us. Dungeons are made to lure people in with whatever wish each individual desires. Did any of you have any desires before becoming a changeling? Has becoming a changeling affected your desire?‚Äù Marcille Laios and Chilchuck stay silent. ‚ÄúCome now‚Ä¶ there must be more to this than merely recovering Falin. Confess!‚Äù The beautiful elf Senshi says all this as if he were a terrible actor on a stage. Senshi‚Äôs eccentric gestures and tone of voice had been really getting on Chilchuck‚Äôs nerves. After another moment of uncomfortable silence Chilchuck speaks up.  ‚ÄúAre you kidding me?! I had no interest in being any taller than I was! I was already paid in advance. All I want is to do my freakin job and go back home to my daughters before they leave me too.‚Äù Marcille gasps at the info drop. ‚ÄúBecoming a changeling I don‚Äôt even think I can do that. This is all a big inconvenience.‚Äù Marcille grabs his shoulder with tears in her eyes.   ‚ÄúOh. How can I forget you have a family to go back to!‚Äù She sniffs. ‚ÄúUm well I think I do feel different now that I have become a halfling. I can‚Äôt do magic anymore or at least anything close to dark magic. Anyway I was always afraid of my friends and family dying off while I had to live on as a long lived elf but since halflings have the shortest lifespan I was thinking that maybe I don‚Äôt have to worry about it anymore since I would die first.‚Äù Laios and Senshi were moved by her words. Chilchuck cringes. He hated it when other races refer to halflings as short lived as if it was some kind of tragedy.   ‚ÄúI had a desire too.‚Äù Laios said confidently. ‚ÄúBeing a tallman is boring. I had always wanted to experience being another race or a werewolf or a troll or giant flying beast and have multiple heads‚Ä¶‚Äù Everyone‚Äôs jaw drops at his confession of wanting to become a monster. Laios blushes and laughs it off. ‚ÄúSince I‚Äôm a dwarf I got what I wanted. Now I just need to stop the Mad Mage from controlling my sister. Also‚Ä¶ while we are being completely honest‚Ä¶ I think Falin looks cool as a chimera. If she wants to stay as she is I wouldn‚Äôt mind.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHave you lost your mind Laios?!‚Äù Marcille and Chilchuck yell.  ‚ÄúLet him give an explanation.‚Äù orders Senshi.  ‚ÄúOnce Falin‚Äôs mind is back to herself maybe we can use the changeling mushrooms to turn her dragon half into a creature that can live on the surface. Marcille can‚Äôt use revive or high level magic as a halfling so if Falin wants to return back to her old body we will have to find other mages or healers on the surface.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSomeone you can trust too that won‚Äôt turn you into the authorities. Remember Marcille is wanted now for tampering with dark magic. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the rest of us will be taken in as accomplices.‚Äù Chilchuck notes. Everyone‚Äôs mood sours at that prospect. Damn. He‚Äôs the worst person in the party for raising morale. ‚ÄúAt- at least we know what we‚Äôre working with so we can think of a better plan later.‚Äù He feels bad he even brought it up.  Settling in for the night Izutsumi crawls back into their quarters slurps up the bowl of soup left out for her and rests at the foot of Chilchuck‚Äôs rolled out blanket.  ‚ÄúThere are black horses out there but I could not catch them. I hate to admit I need help but I want you guys to hunt them for me.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHorses? That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ maybe good to hear. Tomorrow Izutsumi. Tomorrow.  The next day. Is it even daytime? The ceilings of the endless stone walls and towers are sealed over. There‚Äôs no beginning or end to the labyrinth. The walls morph as soon as it‚Äôs out of sight. It was best that everyone stayed together. This was a situation where Chilchuck‚Äôs expertise was vital yet he couldn‚Äôt perform to the best of his abilities. His dulled senses couldn‚Äôt quite feel the subtle draft indicating a hidden passage nor spot the one brick out of place from a wall indicating a trigger to open a hidden door like he should.   The mysterious horses were brought up right away. Nobody had seen them. Even with Laios‚Äô ability to see in the dark he had found no monsters lying in wait in the shadows. He wasn‚Äôt even seeing ghosts anymore.  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see them. I smelled them. I heard them.‚Äù Izutsumi corrects.  ‚ÄúI thought I could hear hooves clattering too‚Äù says Marcille.  ‚ÄúIf they are walking that means they are not hippogriffs. But what would these horses graze on here?‚Äù wonders Senshi. It seemed like these beasts were incredibly shy if they wouldn‚Äôt let themselves be seen. So not very dangerous. The only thing that mattered to the party was how great it would be to eat something that‚Äôs not changeling mushrooms. Who knows if eating those things would affect their transformation. It would be quite awful if it was making it last longer or worse permanent.  ‚ÄúSenshi Izutsumi and I will keep a lookout for that monster while Chilchuck and Marcille work together to move past this dungeon level.‚Äù Laios orders.  ‚ÄúBut I wanted to help find that monster too.‚Äù Marcille pouts.   ‚ÄúWe can do both.‚Äù Chilchuck made an effort to give a more encouraging tone.  Chilchuck felt disappointment in himself that he had to employ Marcille to use her newly heightened senses to try to find a way out of here. He lifts her up and presses her side to the wall so she can listen through. A small orb of light floats over their heads. Marcille can pull off some simple light spells in her halfling form. She wanted to do more such as make another familiar to scout but everyone had been encouraging her to save her mana. The rest of the party stands by a short distance away to keep lookout for the horse monster.  ‚ÄúWhat do you hear Marcille?‚Äù Chilchuck asks her.  ‚ÄúSteps here and there. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ everything sounds like it could be a monster. I hate it‚Ä¶‚Äù She shivers and grabs onto his head tightly. He blushes trying not to imagine her like one of his kids.  ‚ÄúTry to guess where it‚Äôs coming from.‚Äù  He dreads proceeding further into the dungeon. Of the party Marcille and Laios were the power houses. Laios despite being a weirdo knew how to deal with almost every creature they encountered. He had training as a prior army grunt. Since entering the dungeon embracing monster cuisine and becoming a dwarf he‚Äôs losing focus. He doesn‚Äôt have the stamina he used to have. Marcille casted all kinds of magic to counter the Mad Mage the dungeon master during their last encounter. They need Marcille as an elf with lots of mana to stand a chance against him. Falin as a chimera dragon would be nearly impossible to defeat too. How long were they down here? He had always told his daughters to have everything cleaned up after three weeks. He would be back any day past three weeks. They must remove any evidence of partying or boys over. They wouldn‚Äôt have boys over cause his nosey neighbors would have told him all about it. The three of them were all working adults so it‚Äôs unlikely they would have any time to cause too much trouble. It would be so great to be back. He wouldn‚Äôt care if it was a little messy or if they broke into the liquor cabinet. No. He would care about that. It would also be bad if they decided to take things into their own hands to look for him. The thought of his naive girls leaving the safety of their village to look for him in the shady bars and outposts near the entrance to the dungeon taps away his drive to complete the mission.   ‚ÄúI hear some voices.‚Äù Marcille whispers.  Chilchuck hopes it‚Äôs other adventurers. Not likely because no one else seemed to have moved past the large door they had gone through a few days ago. Yet‚Ä¶  ‚ÄúGive me a direction and distance where you heard it from.‚Äù Chichuck instructs her. She stands on his shoulders puts her hands behind her big ears and listens carefully. ‚ÄúI think that way.‚Äù She points forward towards a pillar in the distance. Chichuck turns to tell the party to follow them but they are interrupted by Izutsumi‚Äôs excited barking.  ‚ÄúLook there it is! There it is! See it?! See it?!‚Äù  A black horse with two large horns between its eyes stare down at them from a flat stone rooftop a hundred feet away. Laios identifies it right away.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bicorn!‚Äù  Marcille leaps from Chichuck‚Äôs shoulders and heads over to them.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre saved! We might not have to eat mushrooms again if we can catch it!‚Äù  Those idiots! Chilchuck thought. He watches as the four of them run to the bicorn weapons raised and the bicorn darts off into the darkness. Undeterred by this setback they form a huddle while Chilchuck tiredly looks on. Marcille draws something on the ground and whispers to Senshi. Senshi nods. Laios talks on and on about something. The cat-dog girl wags her tail. Hovering over the huddle Chilchuck couldn‚Äôt make out what they were planning.  ‚ÄúOk it‚Äôs settled!‚Äù Laios exclaims. Senshi goes into his bags gets out a rope and hands it to him. Laios gives him the ax.  ‚ÄúHey where‚Äôs your shield?‚Äù Laios asks.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just give him this for now.‚Äù Senshi gives him his mythril pot.  ‚ÄúWhat? What‚Äôs all this?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt hear?‚Äù asks Marcille.  Senshi and Laios murmur to each other.   ‚ÄúWell he is looking kinda aged‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you!‚Äù Marcille said excitedly. ‚ÄúWe are going to use the scorched earth method.‚Äù She taps her staff near a heat spell inscription on the ground. ‚ÄúWe are going to make a whole lot of these on that side of our prison maze. Senshi is going to activate them. This will smoke the beast out of hiding. Izutsumi will herd it over there.‚Äù She gestures her staff to a bottle neck of walls on the other side. Senshi chimes in.   ‚ÄúHate to see this happen to such a fine horse but we are going to have you rope the beast and cut off its head when it comes to you.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOnce you have it roped. I‚Äôll help you slay it.‚Äù said Laios.  ‚ÄúBut Senshi I thought you hated unnecessary damage to the dungeon environment.‚Äù Chilchuck protests.  ‚ÄúSometimes we need to blow up a few walls to make an exit.‚Äù Senshi admits. Marcille smiles and giggles manically.   ‚ÄúYes. Finally. Senshi come with me.‚Äù  Small strings of smoke emit from Marcille and Senshi‚Äôs side of the labyrinth. Smoking the monster out of hiding will take some time. Laios and Chilchuck wait by the bottleneck going out of the stone courtyard with Izutsumi between the two groups. The theory was as long as there are eyes watching the walls won‚Äôt change. A crash came from where Marcille and Senshi were lighting fires.  ‚ÄúAnytime now.‚Äù Laios runs away from Chilchuck towards the entrance.  ‚ÄúHey! Where you going Laios?‚Äù   ‚ÄúOh um‚Ä¶ it has to do with the nature of bicorns. Bicorns are the opposite of unicorns. Unicorns are pure and can only be approached by virtuous people. Bicorns on the other hand only dishonorable people can-‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need your monster encyclopedia answer. Give me the short answer. Why do you want me to do this alone?‚Äù Chichuck braces himself for Laios to give a blunt explanation.  ‚ÄúEver since you became a tallman‚Ä¶ you look suspicious.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù  Laios dug around in his pockets. ‚ÄúLet me get out my shaving kit. I‚Äôve been having to use it more often since I became a dwarf so I carry it with me. The beard just keeps growing..oh here it is.‚Äù Laiosd shows him his mirror. ‚ÄúLook.‚Äù  Chilchuck thought he had just become taller and bigger in some places. He didn‚Äôt recognise the stubbled middle aged tallman‚Äôs face before him. The man looked like one of those loser goons the ores killed at the crooked pub on level three. One word came to mind: troll. He had turned into a troll. The kind he used to tell his girls about to scare them into doing their chores. If he turned up at their front door like this there was no way they would recognize him. Thus the tragedy of becoming a changeling. Chilchuck turns away listless.  ‚ÄúOh. I see exactly what you mean. I do look like the criminal sort. I‚Äôll be perfect for this role.‚Äù He sluggishly moves back into position.    Laios recognizes that he laid it on him too strong. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to offend you Mr. Chilchuck! Tallmen just look more aged than halflings. You don‚Äôt look bad..you just look more like a father type than you did..I had some issues with um nevermind. Anyway you said some things and I‚Äôm not judging-Oh shit!‚Äù The bicorn leaps past him. The dark horse slows into a walk approaching Chilchuck. All of his body‚Äôs dulled senses bolt awake. His weariness fades away immediately. He stares down the beast slowly walking towards it. He holds up the rope that was tied into a slipknot and drops it over the monster‚Äôs head. The tallman holds it steady while the beast tries to jerk away.  ‚ÄúYou got it!‚Äù Laios exclaims. Chilchuck stares blankly at the line and the monster in disbelief.  ‚ÄúOh damn. I did get it.‚Äù The monster bites down on Chilchuck‚Äôs arm that was not holding the pot shield. Lucky for him he was wearing Laios‚Äô arm bracers. Chilchuck didn‚Äôt have a weapon ready indicating his inexperience with jobs like this. He struggles and backs off just enough for the rope to slip out of his hands. The lassoed bicorn runs back to the courtyard with Chilchuck chasing after it. Laios follows behind them. From their left off in the distance buildings were collapsing. Pillars of fire burst out from the rubble. Senshi Marcille Izutsumi and more bicorns were fleeing the scene with a big cloud of dust coming behind them.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never doing magic again!‚Äù elf Senshi screams.  Concentrating on his quarry Chilchuck tries to grab the dragging rope. He almost grabs it until the bicorn leaps up a ten foot wall onto a roof.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not getting away!‚Äù He jumps up steps on to the protruding rocks and climbs the wall in a flash. Laios runs up to it breathing heavily.  ‚ÄúDamn‚Ä¶ Mr. Chilchuck.‚Äù He looks around for stairs.  At last Chilchuck had the monster cornered. Behind and to the right of the creature was a much higher wall that was several stories. Below was the rest of the party. He takes the ax and throws it. The ax brushes off to the side of the bicorn. He missed. The bicorn lowers its head and paws the dirt with its front hoof. I messed up. The beast springs into a charge at him. He loosens his largest knife out of his side pocket. Holding the knife he attempts to dodge to the side. The horn of the beast punctures his right shoulder. At the same time Chilchuck stabs as hard as he can into the side of the horse‚Äôs head. Brains and blood spill out. At the same time Izutsumi pounces on to its back and bites into the monster‚Äôs neck. The monster collapses to its side letting Chilchuck‚Äôs shoulder go. From the ground it kicks wildly until a moment later Laios steps in and finishes it by piercing its heart with his sword. The kobold beastling howls. Marcille and Senshi cheer. Laios wipes the blood off his blade and sheaths it. He goes right up to Chilchuck and embraces him. Being a lot shorter Laios stood on the dead bicorn. Chilchuck his heart still racing cheerfully raises his fists in the air jumps and laughs with him.  ‚ÄúYou were absolutely crazy! I knew you could fight monsters if you wanted to!‚Äù Laios yells.  ‚ÄúOf course I can! It was a piece of cake!‚Äù  It didn‚Äôt feel like him at all to be this hyped up. As a halfling his senses were at peak all the time except when he was drunk or asleep. It‚Äôs probably why I‚Äôm so stressed out all the time. These lows and highs as a tallman‚Ä¶ it actually feels really good. Maybe that‚Äôs part of why Laios acts like such a happy buffoon.  ‚ÄúLaios! Izutsumi! You got to get Chilchuck down here at once!‚Äù Marcille yells.  Chilchuck sees blood rushing down his arm. He reaches to his neck. The horn must have severed a few important arteries. That‚Äôs strange. I didn‚Äôt even feel any pain. He falls over dead.  Chilchuck gasps and sits up. Laios holds up tiny Marcille as her head sinks. They are inside an enclosure. Senshi already had meat cooking over the fire.  ‚ÄúShe insisted she revive you. You died.‚Äù Laios recounts.  ‚ÄúMarcille..‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe colors duke‚Ä¶ the colors‚Ä¶‚Äù she murmurs to herself.  ‚ÄúSenshi made sure she ate before she used that spell but it still took a lot out of her. It looks like she has a bad case of mana sickness. She‚Äôs most likely completely tapped out of mana too.‚Äù Laios explains. Chilchuck holds his head and groans. He watches Laios lay her over blankets. I shouldn‚Äôt have brought that on you Marcille he thought  ‚ÄúSo I have as much luck dealing with other monsters as mimics.‚Äù Mimics which hide in treasure chests are the only monsters he as a locksmith is required to engage with as per contract. They have killed him many times. Now all monsters are like mimics‚Ä¶ He imagined many different creatures before him turning into crabs. Senshi puts down a strange plate of stringy meat before Isumi Laios and Chilchuck.  ‚ÄúI made sfilacci and I am going to try to make as much of the leftovers into bresaola.‚Äù  They all look at the hair like meat. What‚Äôs with the fanciness? Why can‚Äôt we just have BBQ?  Izutsumi asks ‚ÄúWhat are these words? Oh well it smells good and meaty.‚Äù She gobbles it up. Chilchuck nibbles away at it hiding the fact that he‚Äôs very hungry. Laios eats the hair meatball in one bite. The blonde dwarf looks like he wants to complain but doesn‚Äôt. Senshi whittles away cutting up tiny pieces of the bicorn‚Äôs leg making meticulous micro cuts. We are in a dungeon. Not a five star restaurant.  ‚ÄúSenshi your food prep doesn‚Äôt need to..‚Äù Chilchuck tried to say. Senshi turns around in slow motion his long black curls flowing roses bloom in the air all around him his eyelashes fluttering.  ‚ÄúYou have a critique of my cooking?‚Äù  Chilchuck and Laios are stunned. Izutsumi bluntly interrupts ‚ÄúHad becoming an elf made you lose common sense? I want steak!‚Äù  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt lose anything. I am just the same as I was.‚Äù  Izutsumi narrows her eyes at him. ‚ÄúPretty Senshi you just do your thing. Manly Chilchuck and you too Fat Laios let‚Äôs make something ourselves too. I know you want the good parts.‚Äù Senshi frowns and keeps working.  The three of them move out of the enclosure to build a bigger campfire. It turned out that there wasn‚Äôt only one bicorn killed but five more from the fire explosive magic. All that running around fighting and dying proved to be useless Chilchuck concluded. Chilchuck helps Laios and Izutsumi carry one of the burnt up dead bodies to the campfire. As Chilchuck got the fire going the two butchered the carcass they brought over.   ‚ÄúMagic is so overpowered. There was no point in having me involved.‚Äù  Laios gave him an encouraging smile. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know Senshi was going to be that effective with magic. If anything we were using them to scare the bicorns your way. We did find out one thing.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAnd that was?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have loose morals. The bicorn still attacked you.‚Äù Chichuck sighs and rolls his eyes. ‚ÄúI know Marcille would want to pry into that more but I will leave it there.‚Äù  Thank god. Perhaps Laios is maturing a bit. They set up the grill and put as many steaks on there as they could. As it cooks Chilchuck‚Äôs mind wanders back into his bad habit of rumination. Senshi must be very upset that 1: he was coaxed into using magic 2: we killed way more monsters than we had to and 3: more than half of us are making our own meal. Marcille too is in rough shape.   The first round of steaks are done and Laios passes a big one to everyone‚Äôs plates. Izutsumi brows on it to cool it down before taking a bite. Chilchuck tries his and it tastes amazing probably because he was starved. Being revived takes a lot of vigor out of you. How could he convince Laios to have everyone return to the surface? He remembered the orc girl Leed‚Äôs advice to just be honest yet he also didn‚Äôt want to plead with Laios overly emotional like that last time. Finally he said ‚ÄúI feel bad for Marcille.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI know. I know.‚Äù Laios admits. ‚ÄúWe are not going to be able to proceed without a confident magic user. Marcille is the best we have.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAdmit it we all aren‚Äôt at our best in these forms.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNot entirely. I did chop down on that horse real good.‚Äù Izutsumi smiles and ravishes into another steak.  ‚ÄúYeah! You did do good! Who‚Äôs a good girl!?‚Äù Laios reaches to pat her head. She draws back.  ‚ÄúNoooo. No!‚Äù she barks back at him. Marcille weakly wanders out of the enclosure to them followed by Senshi.  ‚ÄúCome on! Join us!‚Äù Laios calls out to them. They gather around and Laios gives them a steak. Marcille quietly eats with tired eyes. Senshi refused their offering and just wanted to help.  And my conversation is derailed again. Chichuck takes another steak. He eats a few more while Senshi talks about the best ways to cook meat.  ‚ÄúYou know I don‚Äôt understand why I didn‚Äôt think to just make jerky out of all this. Why did that fail to come to my mind? I don‚Äôt know. Perhaps because of the lack of salt?‚Äù As he ate and time went on Chichuck‚Äôs mood improved and he forgot about what he was so worried about. The effect of the food maybe? He probably ate the most in this one sitting than he had ever had for a meal in his entire life.  ‚ÄúSoooo I didn‚Äôt think you did too bad out there. You liked fighting monsters didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Laios poked Chilchuck‚Äôs shoulder with a fork. Laios face gets covered by Chilchuck‚Äôs hand pushing him away. Chilchuck turns his head away from the group hiding his grin.  ‚ÄúMaybe I did feel a bit of a thrill in it‚Ä¶ I blame becoming a tallman or your insanity rubbing off on me. I think my luck with fighting general monsters will be as good as fighting mimics. I will probably die everytime.‚Äù They both laugh together as if they‚Äôre drunk. Marcille gives a concerned look and she speaks up to Senshi.   ‚ÄúI might have been too pushy making you use magic‚Ä¶ we were too reckless.‚Äù  Senshi gazes down at her and nods. In a moment Marcille‚Äôs ears perk up and she sees a small familiar fly through the air over them.  ‚ÄúHey everybody watch out above you!‚Äù They all see it. The familiar looked like a glowing bird. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Canaries. They‚Äôre here!‚Äù Marcille puts out the fire. She opens her book and flashes through the pages. ‚ÄúEveryone stay together. I‚Äôm going to put a camouflage barrier over us so they won‚Äôt see us.‚Äù   ‚ÄúWait! Don‚Äôt-‚Äù Chilchuck cries out. Marcille holds her staff and casts the incantation from the book stops in mid sentence and falls. Chilchuck catches her. The spell failed. Her body‚Äôs not tuned enough in magic to cast high level spells. Especially in the state she was already in. The walls change and a stairwell appears beside their encampment. A party of seven descend the staircase to them. Everyone stands up ready to defend themselves. The only weapons Senshi and Izutsumi had were knives and forks. Laios the only one with his sword on hand gets between the two parties. Chichuck holding Marcille in his arms sizes up the arrivals. The new group of seven only consisted of elves in advanced looking gear and armor. The elves walk up to them. Actually on closer inspection one of the men is a tallman.  ‚ÄúWell well. Hello dungeon adventurers. Please put your sword down dwarf. The rest of you put your‚Ä¶ utensils down. We are merely a dungeon investigation unit.‚Äù an elf with long blonde hair similar in appearance to Marcille orders. They do just that. Another elf with tattoos all over his body circles them.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see the blonde elf mage. This party is completely different than the one described.‚Äù  Chilchuck came to the realization that with their bodies transformed by the changelings they are perfectly disguised from their wanted physical profiles Kabru‚Äôs or Shiro‚Äôs party gave them.  ‚ÄúAre you the only party that made it this far? Have you seen any others?‚Äù the tan elf woman asks them. Laios and Senshi shake their heads. ‚ÄúI mean have you encountered a party of five that has an elf female with blonde hair?‚Äù  An awkward silence. Chilchuck watches them with increased anxiety.   Come on you two say something. Senshi adverts their gaze and taps at Marcille‚Äôs staff with his foot. Senshi was supposed to deal with elves now that he is one. Laios is supposed to be the leader. In this moment of need they are both dead silent. From experience working with Laios he often hesitates when speaking with people he doesn‚Äôt know. He will probably blow their cover. Chilchuck couldn‚Äôt allow that to happen.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been trapped here by ourselves for months.‚Äù Chilchuck speaks out. Everyone in the other party turned their attention to him. Pressure‚Äôs on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Corkus and this is my daughter Neese.‚Äù The elves seemed satisfied with that response.  ‚ÄúThat explains everything. We are also here to evacuate all adventurers from the dungeon and neutralize the dungeon lord. Would you like assistance getting to the surface?‚Äù the blonde elf girl offers. The elves stare at the tallman waiting for an answer believing him to be the leader.  Chilchuck wanted to scream yes but- He turns around to his party.  ‚ÄúWhat do you think? This could be our only way out of here.‚Äù Please everyone‚Ä¶  ‚ÄúOh my head..‚Äù Marcille groans and sits up in his arms. He puts her tiny hand on his cheek. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired papa. Let‚Äôs go home.‚Äù She plays the part really well. Everyone followed suit.  ‚ÄúYeah I think we went as far as we could.‚Äù It seems Laios would go with whatever Marcille wants.  ‚ÄúIt would be nice to restock on spices.‚Äù Senshi says. Izutsumi nods with them.  ‚ÄúThank you. We would like your help.‚Äù Chilchuck answers them pretending to be the party leader.  ‚ÄúI like it when they can be reasoned with. I‚Äôll prepare a spell to get you all to the surface.‚Äù A dark skinned young elf in steel armor steps forward.  ‚ÄúHold it. Before you let them go I want to ask these adventurers a few questions.‚Äù The young man glares up at Chilchuck. The blue eyes look really familiar. ‚ÄúYou know Corkus your gear and clothing of your party appear to be just like Laios‚Äô party‚Äôs clothing and gear. For instance that green circle scarf looks exactly like it belongs to a halfling in Laios‚Äô party. ‚Äù Chilchuck suddenly recognized him. It‚Äôs Kabru. It‚Äôs fucking Kabru and he knows I‚Äôm lying through my teeth. How he disguised himself as an elf and got into the Canaries‚Äô party is anyone‚Äôs guess.  ‚ÄúUm..we all shop at the same stores on the first floor?‚Äù  ‚ÄúAllow me to go through your gear and make sure it wasn‚Äôt stolen.‚Äù   The gig is up. We have our initials on everything. Marcille has her full name on all her gear. A messy haired elf girl interrupts them.   ‚ÄúOh my gosh! Doesn‚Äôt this guy‚Ä¶‚Äù   The other elves drop listening to Kabru‚Äôs conversation and show interest in Senshi. Senshi pulls back his hair and lets it flow in the breeze that‚Äôs coming from nowhere.  ‚ÄúYes! The resemblance is uncanny!‚Äù A female elf with short hair yells.  ‚ÄúWhatever do you mean?‚Äù Senshi asks shyly.  ‚ÄúI mean you‚Äôre that guy from the The Daltian Clan novels. What‚Äôs his name‚Ä¶? the one with the eyepatch on a horse..‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe character‚Äôs name is Forva and he‚Äôs the one with black hair. The one with the eyepatch is actually General Hareus.‚Äù Marcille corrects them in a dreamy whisper.   ‚ÄúOooooh!‚Äù Everyone of the elven‚Äôs party except for the tallman and Kabru exclaim with delight.  ‚ÄúYeah! That!‚Äù nods the elf with the messy hair.  ‚ÄúAww it‚Äôs so cute that the little ones are getting into our popular literature.‚Äù The blonde elf sighs. She completes her spell and reveals a large door portal to the Chilchuck and his companions. ‚ÄúAll done here. Just step on through.‚Äù   ‚ÄúBut-‚Äù Kabru protests. The tan female elf addresses the only tallman in their party.  ‚ÄúCaptain do we need to waste our time questioning these guys anymore?‚Äù  He responds with a firm ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Chilchuck thought it very strange that a tallman would be a party leader to elves from the North Central Continent. I know it‚Äôs a stereotype for tallman males to be party leaders but this is ridiculous.  Laios‚Äô party gather by the portal. It all unravels when Marcille fully wakes up.  ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù  Chilchuck whispers ‚ÄúOut of the dungeon.‚Äù  She gasps and squirms out of his arms.  ‚ÄúNo we can‚Äôt go. What about Falin?‚Äù she says to her party with tears in her eyes.  ‚ÄúEveryone should go including you. I‚Äôll stay and find her myself.‚Äù Laios assures her. Frustrated that all his efforts were about to go nowhere Chilchuck grabs both of them by their shirtsleeves.  ‚ÄúAbsolutely not! You are both going back with us right now!‚Äù  ‚ÄúHey I still need to find that Dungeon Master to undo my curse!‚Äù yells Izutsumi.  ‚ÄúYou think it would hurt if I go through that portal?‚Äù Senshi whimpers. Chilchuck loses his temper.   ‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with you all?!‚Äù They proceed to argue. Kabru puts his palm to his face.  ‚ÄúPeople. We got company.‚Äù The messy haired elf uses her familiars to widely illuminate the area. The dead bicorns that they didn‚Äôt eat rose up. Headless men in black armor emerge and mount the beasts. One of them rides closer holding a giant sword the tip of it scraping across the dungeon floor. The Captain uses a spell that makes two of them split in half from the waist. The headless men turn into black smoke and reappear fully intact.  ‚ÄúPhantoms.‚Äù The tallman grits his teeth heavy sweat appearing on his brow.  ‚ÄúWhat are you waiting for?‚Äù The messy haired elf pushes Senshi into the portal. The cat-kobold follows him. More mounted headless black knights come out of the shadows surrounding them. Chilchuck kneels down and meets Laios and Marcille‚Äôs eyes.  ‚ÄúPleeease go.‚Äù he pleads feeling exhausted.  ‚ÄúYes. We are going. Come on.‚Äù Laios puts his arm around Marcille and directs her toward the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but Dunahan are really bad to go up against.‚Äù He shouts out to the Canary party. ‚ÄúThe rest of you should return too!‚Äù Laios and Marcille disappear into the portal. Chilchuck leaves the elves behind but just before he entered the portal he heard one of them say.   ‚ÄúWe should retreat too. Captain stepped through a changeling ring and it‚Äôs negatively affecting his mana use.‚Äù  They return to the inside of the governor‚Äôs residence. The room was within the town hall section. Laios held his mouth and immediately ran for the exit to throw up. Transportation sickness is the worst for dwarfs. Curious what the elves said about the Captain Chilchuck waits for the other party to make it through the portal. He notices that Laios and Marcille have already left the building.  ‚ÄúOh you‚Äôre still here.‚Äù said the blonde magic-using elf. ‚ÄúYou can go now.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou said something about the Captain experiencing going through a changeling ring?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYes a couple members of our party had undergone an inconvenient transformation.‚Äù Senshi and Izutsumi grab Chilchuck‚Äôs arms and start moving him to the exit. He had to get more information. Anything better than going with the knowledge of changelings from his homeland.  ‚ÄúIs there a cure?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYeah. It‚Äôs easy. Just practice good hygiene. Once Captain and our tallman guide have washed off the spores they should be back in shape in less than twelve hours. It‚Äôs really stubborn the longer it isn‚Äôt treated. Once the fungus settles into your nails you‚Äôre screwed.‚Äù  Chilchuck‚Äôs color drains out of his face as he hears her warning. Senshi and Izutsumi lead him to the door out of there. Kabru happily waves to them.  ‚ÄúGoodbye. Maybe I‚Äôll meet you at the bathhouse later.‚Äù  To everyone‚Äôs surprise it was a sunny early afternoon at the surface. The dungeon was in the process of being evacuated and it showed. There were people of all races everywhere. Many figured the days of looting the dungeon were over and were in the process of packing up. Temporary shops were set up with signs saying ‚ÄúOne day only sale!‚Äù ‚ÄúLast Chance before we relocate.‚Äù and ‚ÄúEverything must go.‚Äù If this were different circumstances some shopping would have been in order but removing the fungal spores is a priority. They head for Laios‚Äô apartment the only place they have to go to in town since Senshi lives in the dungeon Izutsumi came from overseas and Chilchuck‚Äôs home is several miles away. Laios‚Äô apartment key was lost with his gear in the dungeon so Chilchuck had to lockpick his way in while the rest stood around him looking very suspicious. Once inside he reminded everyone that they all must wash off those spores. Once inside Laios gathered whatever soaps he could find and a washtub. He had to use a broomstick to get a box of shampoos from Falin‚Äôs closet for Marcille. Chilchuck pushed for them to wash out back instead of the bathhouse because it would be crowded due to the dungeon evacuation. He also didn‚Äôt want to run into Kabru the captain or Shiro‚Äôs group if they are still on the island. He dreaded the scenario in which Laios tells Shiro that they failed and the samurai decides to cut off Laios head or hunt down Falin to put her out of her misery.  He could not help but feel astounded that the interior of the apartment was just like the insides of the buildings in his hometown. Everything is normal sized. Actually he now had to watch his head going through doors. It will be a relief to be short again. Chilchuck walks into Falin‚Äôs side of the apartment to find Marcille on Falin‚Äôs bed crying. Izutsumi was sitting beside her providing comfort. He turns around and heads back before they notice his presence. Laios and Senshi had everything ready.   ‚ÄúWe will wash first outside and bring fresh water to the girls so they can bathe privately.‚Äù Senshi suggests.   ‚ÄúSounds like a plan.‚Äù Chilchuck responds.  Monsters sometimes do appear outside of the dungeon. Changelings were one of them. It was thought that the fairies would replace human children with one of their own to play a cruel joke. It was said that changelings were a problem in his hometown many years ago. The way the halfling community dealt with changelings was throwing them in a burn pit. Any mushroom fairy circles found were burned. Yep fire was the solution. Good thing the real way to turn back to himself was simply washing off the mushroom spores. They went up a nearby stream and got water. Chilchuck anticipated that Senshi and Laios wouldn‚Äôt want to bathe. Senshi because he rarely bathed as a dwarf and Laios because he wants to remain a changeling dwarf. To his surprise they both comply without any hesitation. They wash their gear and clothes too. That included Laios‚Äô transformed sword. Chilchuck walks into a pond the creek was feeding. Wouldn‚Äôt you want to remain changed? Tiny black specks swim up to his legs making him step back out. They‚Äôre just tadpoles. Normal animals. The dangers of the dungeon have made him skittish. He jumps in plunges himself in the water and scrubs hard. Laios once again lends him some of his fresh clothes that would fit a tallman. Laios squeezes into one of his own shirts the best he could and rolls up his sleeves. Finally Senshi boils the water and fills it for the girls. Chilchuck wanted to wash up so bad that he didn‚Äôt care about water temperature. The girls on the other hand‚Ä¶ Well they wanted it to be nice for them. The process takes time so Chilchuck asks Laios to borrow his shaving kit. Laios and Senshi both tease him offering to tell him how to use it. Away from them with a bit of a learning curve Chilchuck shaves his beard off revealing a warped troll version of his old face. He could already feel that the hair would grow back in hours. How could Laios do this everyday? He returned to Senshi and Laios to see them in deep conversation. They stop as soon as they see him. What were they talking about? he wondered.   ‚ÄúThe water is ready for them. We‚Äôll just take it up to the apartment.‚Äù Senshi says.  ‚ÄúYou mean Laios and I.‚Äù Chilchuck responds knowing well that elf Senshi can‚Äôt lift. Carrying the washtub up with Laios Chilchuck smells a flowery perfume from the water. ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ Marcille likes it fancy.‚Äù Chilchuck‚Äôs instincts sense a scheme but decides not to push it. They bring the water over to Falin‚Äôs room. Only Marcille remained on the bed.  ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Izutsumi?‚Äù Laios asks.  ‚ÄúOh she got tired of waiting and took off. She told me she would clean off the spores on her own.‚Äù Marcille answers.  ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be helped.‚Äù Senshi admits.  The three of them wait seated in Laios‚Äô side of the apartment while Marcille washes herself in Falin‚Äôs room. Marcille calls over to them.  ‚ÄúSo once we are back in our normal bodies we will go down again?‚Äù The three grimace at the prospect of telling her bad news. Chilchuck was about to say something then Laios spoke up.  ‚ÄúThe dungeon is being sealed away. The Canaries will enter in a couple days and defeat the Mad Mage.‚Äù He pauses. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what will become of Falin.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat will we do? What can we do?‚Äù A long silence fell upon them.  ‚ÄúWe should go to the pub tonight.‚Äù Chilchuck finally suggests. Everyone else was taken aback.  ‚ÄúChilchuck really? Really!?‚Äù Marcille screams over to them.  He defends his proposal. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we always do after we return to the surface. It‚Äôs tradition.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt go out and party at a time like this?! What if you turn back into a halfling in Laios‚Äô clothing over there?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be so happy I‚Äôll dance on the table naked. I‚Äôll be so drunk I won‚Äôt care.‚Äù  ‚ÄúChilchuck you‚Äôre an idiot!‚Äù  ‚ÄúGoing to the pub doesn‚Äôt sound too bad to me.‚Äù Laios admits. Senshi agrees.  ‚ÄúYou guys are so insensitive!‚Äù  ‚ÄúI thought you loved the food there.‚Äù Laios said. Chilchuck could hear splashing and grumbling from her side.  ‚ÄúHurry and finish up Marcille. There‚Äôs gonna be a big crowd tonight. We need to get there early to get good seats.‚Äù  ‚ÄúCome over here. I need help with something.‚Äù Chilchuck glances over to Laios and Senshi sitting in the corner looking a bit scared. He sighs stands up and walks over to the entrance. A fully clothed Marcille drops a bucket of water on his head from above. She laughs and surries away.  ‚ÄúYou little gremlin!‚Äù He yells as he chases after her.

6,Dungeon Meshi,['musings'  'i relate to izutsumi in this i really do'  "and it's so cool to see it actually portrayed in media for once! kindly!"  'i can only hope it continues to be kind ;-;'  'anime only so no spoilers please'],icefang111,Commented this in a youtube video but I wanna share it here cause more people should hear it actually. (also op of the video was really nice about it once I pointed it out so wanna share it w more people)  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually really sad about your take on Izutsumi‚Äôs ‚Äòpicky eating‚Äô esp after the praise for how Laios‚Äôs autism was handled.    It was honestly so refreshing when it‚Äôs so often dismissed as childish to see Izutsumi get treated with respect for it and have it accommodated as best they could. So often these things are glossed over in shows and for a bit I thought our only take on it would be Marcilles cultural food hangups which would be treated as a flaw to be overcome. So seeing Izutsumi and that the story would actually address this topic for once was‚Ä¶ amazing if scary as idk how it‚Äôll be handled fully yet.    I have a lot of difficulties with food from a lot of underlying mental health issues most other ‚Äòpicky eaters‚Äô do too (I‚Äôm sure Izutsumi with her cat nose and tongue and many on the spectrum can relate to the sensory hell certain foods can be as one example). It‚Äôs always been a huge source of shame and serious difficulty in my life particularly because so many people view it the way you do in this review. With ridicule and seeing it as unreasonable as just choosing to be difficult. But asking me or Izutsumi to ‚Äújust get over it‚Äù because it‚Äôs not convenient right now is every bit as unreasonable as asking Laios to ‚Äújust take the hint/read the room‚Äù. It‚Äôs just this behavior is from a disorder you don‚Äôt respect.   Sure yes it causes problems! Of course it would disabilities do that! But honestly as an anime only I deeply hope that while Izutsumi becomes less selfish she DOESN‚ÄôT stop being a picky eater. That those two things are decoupled from one another! I am so sick of seeing it portrayed as some character flaw people just have to get over whenever it actually comes up. Having someone who doesn‚Äôt stop being a ‚Äòpicky eater‚Äô but still has a healthy and respected relationship with food in a show so focused on the philosophy and morality of food would be amazing. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs how the story will take it but I hope it does. I‚Äôd be really sad to see it treated as a childish flaw here.   All this to say: seeing Izutsumi treated with respect for what food she can and can‚Äôt eat and through being treated with respect starting to work with Senshi and doing what she could to compromise was every bit as therapeutic for me as the Laios/Shuro fight was for those on the spectrum. And I just wish people would treat that with a bit more respect and understanding.‚Äù,2024-07-08 04:10:37 GMT

(laios touden x reader) rating. nsfw.  content. facesitting (reader on laios) fingering a little ass play. reader has a vagina but no gender specific terms are used.  word count. 1.4k  an. this is not proofread *silly anime girl pose* enjoy it nonetheless. ive been asked a TON for Laios and facesitting so. this is for all y&#x27;all out there. also im trying something new‚Ä¶reader has no specific dialogue (for the sake of being more immersive) so let me know how that works for your experience reading!  Laios is hungry. Starving. Absolutely famished. There‚Äôs only one food that can quell his longing and by the grace of whatever deity favors his unworthy self the object of his desire lays a few mere inches from his mouth.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Your knees rest on either side of Laios‚Äôs head digging divots in the mattress. Each passing second you can feel warm breath pass over the space between your thighs causing you to shiver. You‚Äôve spent enough time dry humping this lovely slab of a man he owes you a proper orgasm after wasting himself inside his briefs. You position yourself a bit more comfortably on the man lowering yourself onto him.  Faced with the view between your inner thighs‚Ä¶Laios can‚Äôt help but lick his lips. The soft flesh before him is covered in a coating of curly fur. Shiny wetness between them highlights your slit its surface causes him to reminisce of the slimes he‚Äôs encountered in the dungeon. He reaches out to scoop a bit onto his index finger and smears it between his thumb so he can admire the way it coats his fingers and stretches between them. The sight before him never fails to make Laios‚Äôs jaw slack open. It‚Äôs gorgeous. You‚Äôre gorgeous.  For once in his life Laios knows better than to say something out loud. But you remind him of his most favorite thing in the best way possible‚Äî a monster. And you‚Äôre his beloved specimen by far. The appearance changes to your discretion. The flavor always unalike what it was once before. He‚Äôs always itching to get a taste. The hunger inside him never dissipates when it comes to you.  He leans forward and gives a tentative lick due to a blend of nerves and excitement. The gentle sigh you heave out makes him smile.  You always have a unique taste. Laios would describe it as tangy but with certain undertones that make it more of an umami flavor‚Äîno experience. He wonders what you‚Äôve eaten today. Must‚Äôve been something out of the ordinary. Your flavor is a bit more pervasive than usual. He‚Äôll have to get another taste. And another. Mulling it over bit by bit seems to occupy his mind.  You feel his tongue lick a stripe up you the tip just barely parting your slit. You whine a bit pushing yourself further into his face. Laios doesn‚Äôt mean to tease you‚Äôre aware of that. He always has to take his time to savor you. But you‚Äôre growing impatient. You don‚Äôt want him to wait‚Äîyou want him to devour. Show your slit the same lack of discretion he does with the variety of questionable dishes he adores making.  Thankfully he seems to get the message. Laios hoists his arms over your hips pressing his warm lips to the expanse of your inner thighs and groin as he starts to sink your weight down onto his jaw. The apex of his broad nose rests against your clit as he takes a deep inhale of your scent and you can see him roll his eyes back when he does. He swears it drives him mad and in an entirely biological sense it does. (He‚Äôs given you quite the information session on the pheromones your body produces and how it activates his senses on a hormonal and physical level.)  ‚ÄúYou smell so good‚Ä¶‚Äù He mumbles. He‚Äôs not lying. There‚Äôs a line a drool streaming from his lips.  Warm moist breath coats your skin as he sighs out a pleasured exhale. Now his tongue ventures out his mouth with purpose. It slowly trails your insides as he maps out the part of your body he‚Äôs come to love so much. Instinctively you twitch against him your noises cutting the silence of the room‚Äîsave for Laios‚Äôs deep breaths and pounding heart.  The way his tongue feels against you is always a delightful experience. It‚Äôs soft and warm‚Ä¶you think if you concentrate you can feel each one of his tastebuds as he attempts so sap you of as much of your taste into his mouth. Laios isn‚Äôt shy in the slightest as he licks between your labia and up to your clit giving the bundle of nerves a slight suck and grinding the underside against the flat of his tongue before moving back down again just to repeat the motion. He eats you like a man starved but with enough tact to showcase he‚Äôs not doing it just for you‚Äîbut for himself as well. It‚Äôs almost selfish in a way. Eating you out is an extreme turn on for him.  Tasting you is like having a bite of his favorite dish. He wants more. Needs more. Thick calloused thumbs move to open your lips apart. He has to taste everything you have to offer. The cool feeling of Laios‚Äôs sharp exhale makes you shiver with anticipation.  Ever the experienced eater Laios applies the same tactics he used eating the Living Armor a while ago onto your clit. As much as he loves exploring and flicking his tongue over ever part of you he knows it‚Äôs important he focuses attention on that nub especially. He‚Äôs sure to lavish it with attention in between his ventures down to gather your slick into his mouth swallowing it with a pleased groan as you tremble before him. One of his thumbs impales your hole followed by another as he stretches you out ever so slowly. The sight of you so open before him makes Laios swallow audibly.  ‚ÄúYou taste even better than you smell.‚Äù Laios‚Äôs voice is gravelly. You‚Äôd swear he‚Äôd been hypnotized. ‚ÄúI just‚Äî.‚Äù There‚Äôs an audible shudder in his tone as he whines. ‚ÄúLove you‚Ä¶‚Äù  His brows furrow in concentration as he pulls you flush against him. You‚Äôve always been a bit hesitant to put your full weight on him which makes Laios roll his eyes internally. He‚Äôd gladly let you break his neck and then some if it means you‚Äôll grind against his face like an animal in heat while he laps up your juices. His thumbs leave you now being replaced by his warm tongue diving in your hole. He rocks you against his face as you‚Äôre fucked thoroughly on his appendage your clit bumping the point of his nose every now and then. It‚Äôs a phenomenal feeling. Your walls flutter and clench around him as your orgasm starts to build.  Laios lifts you for just a moment to catch his breath but also gather some slick onto his wet thumb and spread it along your asshole. He lowers you back down again not before rimming the surface of your ass to spread a plethora of wetness then lets the tip of his thumb glide over the muscle and gently penetrate you from behind as well. He‚Äôs sure not to go too deep just enough to add a little bit more your experience. If he could eat your ass and pussy at the same time he‚Äôd more than gladly do it. The rhythm he fucks you on his face matches the pathetic way he humps the air. Despite being spent already he can‚Äôt help but do so.  Not much time passes before you start to feel close‚Äîthat all too familiar feeling of warmth spreading from the base of your spine to your groin. Your brows furrow as you catch your lip between your teeth. As if on instinct your thighs start to slowly begin to encase Laios‚Äôs head as your breathing starts to become labored. You‚Äôre almost there. Right on the edge. Laios can tell from your body language. He hums in delight as you shudder now grinding yourself on his face and rubbing your clit against his nose as your orgasm starts to rear its head.  One of his hands stalls you for just enough time to allow Laios to catch your clit in between his lips. He lets the flat of his tongue stroke the underside of it before beginning to suck at at‚Äîand that‚Äôs what does it. You come undone with a cry of his name onto his face noises of pleasure and curses spilling out your mouth as you do so. Laios happily licks at you as you do so coaxing you through your orgasm. You have to physically remove yourself from Laios‚Äôs face as the pleasure becomes too overstimulating. If you didn‚Äôt Laios would keep going until you‚Äôre numb.  As you flop over onto the sheets Laios quickly moves over to kiss you. You can taste yourself on his tongue‚Äîthat same distinct flavor he‚Äôs obsessed with. You‚Äôre not sure why he‚Äôs infatuated with it. But you let him have it. There‚Äôs plenty weirder things he could be tasting‚Äîor honestly has tasted. At least you can be sure you‚Äôre definitely number one in his culinary experience.,2024-07-08 06:39:50 GMT

Laios is hungry. Starving. Absolutely famished. There‚Äôs only one food that can quell his longing and by the grace of whatever deity favors his unworthy self the object of his desire lays a few mere inches from his mouth.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Your knees rest on either side of Laios‚Äôs head digging divots in the mattress. Each passing second you can feel warm breath pass over the space between your thighs causing you to shiver. You‚Äôve spent enough time dry humping this lovely slab of a man he owes you a proper orgasm after wasting himself inside his briefs. You position yourself a bit more comfortably on the man lowering yourself onto him.  Faced with the view between your inner thighs‚Ä¶Laios can‚Äôt help but lick his lips. The soft flesh before him is covered in a coating of curly fur. Shiny wetness between them highlights your slit its surface causes him to reminisce of the slimes he‚Äôs encountered in the dungeon. He reaches out to scoop a bit onto his index finger and smears it between his thumb so he can admire the way it coats his fingers and stretches between them. The sight before him never fails to make Laios‚Äôs jaw slack open. It‚Äôs gorgeous. You‚Äôre gorgeous.  For once in his life Laios knows better than to say something out loud. But you remind him of his most favorite thing in the best way possible‚Äî a monster. And you‚Äôre his beloved specimen by far. The appearance changes to your discretion. The flavor always unalike what it was once before. He‚Äôs always itching to get a taste. The hunger inside him never dissipates when it comes to you.  He leans forward and gives a tentative lick due to a blend of nerves and excitement. The gentle sigh you heave out makes him smile.  You always have a unique taste. Laios would describe it as tangy but with certain undertones that make it more of an umami flavor‚Äîno experience. He wonders what you‚Äôve eaten today. Must‚Äôve been something out of the ordinary. Your flavor is a bit more pervasive than usual. He‚Äôll have to get another taste. And another. Mulling it over bit by bit seems to occupy his mind.  You feel his tongue lick a stripe up you the tip just barely parting your slit. You whine a bit pushing yourself further into his face. Laios doesn‚Äôt mean to tease you‚Äôre aware of that. He always has to take his time to savor you. But you‚Äôre growing impatient. You don‚Äôt want him to wait‚Äîyou want him to devour. Show your slit the same lack of discretion he does with the variety of questionable dishes he adores making.  Thankfully he seems to get the message. Laios hoists his arms over your hips pressing his warm lips to the expanse of your inner thighs and groin as he starts to sink your weight down onto his jaw. The apex of his broad nose rests against your clit as he takes a deep inhale of your scent and you can see him roll his eyes back when he does. He swears it drives him mad and in an entirely biological sense it does. (He‚Äôs given you quite the information session on the pheromones your body produces and how it activates his senses on a hormonal and physical level.)  ‚ÄúYou smell so good‚Ä¶‚Äù He mumbles. He‚Äôs not lying. There‚Äôs a line a drool streaming from his lips.  Warm moist breath coats your skin as he sighs out a pleasured exhale. Now his tongue ventures out his mouth with purpose. It slowly trails your insides as he maps out the part of your body he‚Äôs come to love so much. Instinctively you twitch against him your noises cutting the silence of the room‚Äîsave for Laios‚Äôs deep breaths and pounding heart.  The way his tongue feels against you is always a delightful experience. It‚Äôs soft and warm‚Ä¶you think if you concentrate you can feel each one of his tastebuds as he attempts so sap you of as much of your taste into his mouth. Laios isn‚Äôt shy in the slightest as he licks between your labia and up to your clit giving the bundle of nerves a slight suck and grinding the underside against the flat of his tongue before moving back down again just to repeat the motion. He eats you like a man starved but with enough tact to showcase he‚Äôs not doing it just for you‚Äîbut for himself as well. It‚Äôs almost selfish in a way. Eating you out is an extreme turn on for him.  Tasting you is like having a bite of his favorite dish. He wants more. Needs more. Thick calloused thumbs move to open your lips apart. He has to taste everything you have to offer. The cool feeling of Laios‚Äôs sharp exhale makes you shiver with anticipation.  Ever the experienced eater Laios applies the same tactics he used eating the Living Armor a while ago onto your clit. As much as he loves exploring and flicking his tongue over ever part of you he knows it‚Äôs important he focuses attention on that nub especially. He‚Äôs sure to lavish it with attention in between his ventures down to gather your slick into his mouth swallowing it with a pleased groan as you tremble before him. One of his thumbs impales your hole followed by another as he stretches you out ever so slowly. The sight of you so open before him makes Laios swallow audibly.  ‚ÄúYou taste even better than you smell.‚Äù Laios‚Äôs voice is gravelly. You‚Äôd swear he‚Äôd been hypnotized. ‚ÄúI just‚Äî.‚Äù There‚Äôs an audible shudder in his tone as he whines. ‚ÄúLove you‚Ä¶‚Äù  His brows furrow in concentration as he pulls you flush against him. You‚Äôve always been a bit hesitant to put your full weight on him which makes Laios roll his eyes internally. He‚Äôd gladly let you break his neck and then some if it means you‚Äôll grind against his face like an animal in heat while he laps up your juices. His thumbs leave you now being replaced by his warm tongue diving in your hole. He rocks you against his face as you‚Äôre fucked thoroughly on his appendage your clit bumping the point of his nose every now and then. It‚Äôs a phenomenal feeling. Your walls flutter and clench around him as your orgasm starts to build.  Laios lifts you for just a moment to catch his breath but also gather some slick onto his wet thumb and spread it along your asshole. He lowers you back down again not before rimming the surface of your ass to spread a plethora of wetness then lets the tip of his thumb glide over the muscle and gently penetrate you from behind as well. He‚Äôs sure not to go too deep just enough to add a little bit more your experience. If he could eat your ass and pussy at the same time he‚Äôd more than gladly do it. The rhythm he fucks you on his face matches the pathetic way he humps the air. Despite being spent already he can‚Äôt help but do so.  Not much time passes before you start to feel close‚Äîthat all too familiar feeling of warmth spreading from the base of your spine to your groin. Your brows furrow as you catch your lip between your teeth. As if on instinct your thighs start to slowly begin to encase Laios‚Äôs head as your breathing starts to become labored. You‚Äôre almost there. Right on the edge. Laios can tell from your body language. He hums in delight as you shudder now grinding yourself on his face and rubbing your clit against his nose as your orgasm starts to rear its head.  One of his hands stalls you for just enough time to allow Laios to catch your clit in between his lips. He lets the flat of his tongue stroke the underside of it before beginning to suck at at‚Äîand that‚Äôs what does it. You come undone with a cry of his name onto his face noises of pleasure and curses spilling out your mouth as you do so. Laios happily licks at you as you do so coaxing you through your orgasm. You have to physically remove yourself from Laios‚Äôs face as the pleasure becomes too overstimulating. If you didn‚Äôt Laios would keep going until you‚Äôre numb.  As you flop over onto the sheets Laios quickly moves over to kiss you. You can taste yourself on his tongue‚Äîthat same distinct flavor he‚Äôs obsessed with. You‚Äôre not sure why he‚Äôs infatuated with it. But you let him have it. There‚Äôs plenty weirder things he could be tasting‚Äîor honestly has tasted. At least you can be sure you‚Äôre definitely number one in his culinary experience.,2024-07-08 06:39:50 GMT

The first time Kabru gives up his life to maintain his control. He changes the course of the entire story with this action and is willing to die to achieve that. Kabru is (supposedly) entrusting the future to Laios but he is still very much the primary actor in the overall narrative. He is still the one choosing what the story should be.  The second time however Kabru gives up his control to keep hold of something personal and selfish (in the way of dungeon meshi selfishness - it is a good thing to keep this desire. It small piece of what makes him a living creature). He steps aside to let Laios choose the way forward.

Just a crew of guys who are in classes that are completely different from what normally is typical in fantasy.

The first time Kabru gives up his life to maintain his control. He changes the course of the entire story with this action and is willing to die to achieve that. Kabru is (supposedly) entrusting the future to Laios but he is still very much the primary actor in the overall narrative. He is still the one choosing what the story should be.  The second time however Kabru gives up his control to keep hold of something personal and selfish (in the way of dungeon meshi selfishness - it is a good thing to keep this desire. It small piece of what makes him a living creature). He steps aside to let Laios choose the way forward. He surrenders narrative agency for personal agency‚Ä¶ not changing the story but changing himself.,2024-07-08 09:06:26 GMT

69,Dungeon Meshi,['chilchuck tims'  'laios touden'  'chilaios'  'imp chatters'],darthlivion,Anon asked me ‚ÄúDo you see them catching feelings in the dungeon or post Canon? How do they come to realize those feelings‚Äù at the end of that prompt for Chilaios and this is my answer for that:  I see them catching feelings in the dungeon. I also see Chilchuck not even realizing he is catching feelings not until later potentially post canon. I also see him refusing to say anything too afraid of hurting Laios like he hurt his (ex)wife.  Laios meanwhile caught feelings before canon but never says anything because as Chilchuck‚Äôs employer he just can‚Äôt do that to him. It‚Äôs messed up and he didn‚Äôt want Chilchuck to think it was because he was a half foot that Laios would think it‚Äôs ok to say anything. ‚ÄúInter party relationships are problem‚Äù is what Chilchuck said (or something similar in canon) and Laios wouldn‚Äôt cross that line not with Chilchuck.  I see Laios maybe telling Chilchuck before the final boss (Listen I haven‚Äôt read the manga yet so I‚Äôm sorry) worried about if he dies or whatever and he tells Chilchuck you don‚Äôt have to respond I just wanted to let you know‚Ä¶  And Chilchuck probably realizes ‚ÄúOh shit I love this loser‚Äù and after they survive he smacks Laios on the head for scaring him (like the slapstick anime kind of slap not a violent abusive slap) and if we wanna be HELLA gay he just tugs Laios into a kiss next.

But at the end of the manga just like at the beginning of the anime Fallin still remained the plot hook. Even with the little tidbits into her time at home and at school and in the dungeon. She served as a way to get the players into the dungeon and to show the relationships she would have had with each of them while serving to further the main characters‚Äô development.   I like the manga. I like the story. It‚Äôs pretty quick. I was done in 2 days with time to rest and work in between.

957,Dungeon Meshi,['dungeon meshi spoilers'  'dm hc'  'come play in this space with meeeeeee'],mossmittens,I love coming up with traditions around the Faligon feast. It‚Äôs the most obvious start to a festival holiday possible right? Like it‚Äôs a huge community endeavor that marks the start of a reign/dynasty.  The obvious bits are that the holiday would be an annual communal festival potluck style and it would last a full week. Small towns would have it in the town square larger cities would maybe have a few nexuses. It starts as just a small feast to celebrate a year of hard work on the kingdom but everybody really enjoys it. They don‚Äôt have enough money to make a huge feast possible that first year. But year 2? Year 2 is rough and they have the money now. They. are. partying. And it just spins out from there. (Kabru advocated for it because he loves The Story of The Kingdom.) Maybe a few years post-canon Laios + friends would freeze a little effigy of Falin and have it nearby during the feast week. Then on the last day they‚Äôd break it out and ‚Äúresurrect‚Äù her. It‚Äôd be a little inside joke for them but it would totally leak out into the village and then spread like wildfire. In 500 years people wind up freezing barbie dolls for this lmao And about 50 years into celebrating some communities started crowning a ‚ÄúKing Laios‚Äù at the start of the festival for fun. Maybe they‚Äôd get a little cape and would be required to finish the last bite of food on the last day. It‚Äôd start as a little joke but over the years it would become a huge political thing that people would fight over. I think the food would just be ‚Äúwhatever you‚Äôve got and can spare‚Äù but it would be fun if the story of the actual feast got vague over time so people wind up making food shaped like red dragons. Some communities hunt monsters for the meal but it‚Äôs not a common thing (still taboo to eat monster meat) Obviously they‚Äôd have plays telling the story of the Winged Lion and the start of the Touden dynasty (it‚Äôs a national holiday! you must learn history!) Years and years later the story of the first feast gets so twisted up and becomes a huge subject of debate. People are like ‚Äúno way the meat wasn‚Äôt actually Falin Touden. That‚Äôs just an allegory later scholars came up with! They were just eating a big meal so they had enough mana to heal her :)‚Äù and other such things. Marcille has difficult feelings about the feast after Laios and Falin die. She hates seeing the story get twisted but probably realizes that the point of the feast isn‚Äôt the story so much as the community. She does send strongly worded letters to any historians that try to deny the story though. She has it well documented.,2024-07-08 20:34:45 GMT

957,Dungeon Meshi,['dungeon meshi spoilers'  'dm hc'  'come play in this space with meeeeeee'],mossmittens,I love coming up with traditions around the Faligon feast. It‚Äôs the most obvious start to a festival holiday possible right? Like it‚Äôs a huge community endeavor that marks the start of a reign/dynasty.  The obvious bits are that the holiday would be an annual communal festival potluck style and it would last a full week. Small towns would have it in the town square larger cities would maybe have a few nexuses. It starts as just a small feast to celebrate a year of hard work on the kingdom but everybody really enjoys it. They don‚Äôt have enough money to make a huge feast possible that first year. But year 2? Year 2 is rough and they have the money now. They. are. partying. And it just spins out from there. (Kabru advocated for it because he loves The Story of The Kingdom.) Maybe a few years post-canon Laios + friends would freeze a little effigy of Falin and have it nearby during the feast week. Then on the last day they‚Äôd break it out and ‚Äúresurrect‚Äù her. It‚Äôd be a little inside joke for them but it would totally leak out into the village and then spread like wildfire. In 500 years people wind up freezing barbie dolls for this lmao And about 50 years into celebrating some communities started crowning a ‚ÄúKing Laios‚Äù at the start of the festival for fun. Maybe they‚Äôd get a little cape and would be required to finish the last bite of food on the last day. It‚Äôd start as a little joke but over the years it would become a huge political thing that people would fight over. I think the food would just be ‚Äúwhatever you‚Äôve got and can spare‚Äù but it would be fun if the story of the actual feast got vague over time so people wind up making food shaped like red dragons. Some communities hunt monsters for the meal but it‚Äôs not a common thing (still taboo to eat monster meat) Obviously they‚Äôd have plays telling the story of the Winged Lion and the start of the Touden dynasty (it‚Äôs a national holiday! you must learn history!) Years and years later the story of the first feast gets so twisted up and becomes a huge subject of debate. People are like ‚Äúno way the meat wasn‚Äôt actually Falin Touden. That‚Äôs just an allegory later scholars came up with! They were just eating a big meal so they had enough mana to heal her :)‚Äù and other such things. Marcille has difficult feelings about the feast after Laios and Falin die. She hates seeing the story get twisted but probably realizes that the point of the feast isn‚Äôt the story so much as the community. She does send strongly worded letters to any historians that try to deny the story though. She has it well documented.,2024-07-08 20:34:45 GMT

I went to a panel hosted by Orange Studio where they talked about the next seasons for BEASTARS and Trigun Stampede (more on that in a sec). They also announced the anime adaptation of Leviathan which I had never heard about before. I‚Äôll definitely be looking out for that later!!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; I also got to be at the panel presented by Crunchyrolll where they announced Trigun Stargaze! It was kinda funny how the crowd (me included) absolutely lost it when they revealed the new logo for Trigun‚Äôs last season üî´‚≠êÔ∏è   I was able to get Orange Studio‚Äôs Yoshihiro Watanabe the producer in charge of Trigun and BEASTARS to sign my badge (I didnt have anything else üò≠)  And I was able to go to two panels with Witch Hat Atelier‚Äôs mangaka Kamome Shirahama. As much as I would love to share pictures of these panels she requested no photography so I don‚Äôt have any other pics üò¢  The best part of these panels was viewing the PV in a room full of ppl just as excited and awed as me. GO CHECK OUT THE PV ITS GORGEOUS ü™Ñ‚ú®  I also attended a live drawing and Q&amp;A panel for Dungeon Meshi. Everyone had great questions and it was interesting to see the drawing process!! ü•ò  Also I was able to buy amazing merch and get autographs from voice actors Griffin Burns (Tartaglia/Childe Muichiro Canute) and Robbie Daymond (Goro Akechi Megumi Fushiguro Shoya Ishida).,2024-07-09 00:34:45 GMT

The story simply tells us that he has good enough intentions and that his actions actually align with what a ‚Äúgood‚Äù person would do when it comes to the thick of it even if he can be a little mean or morally dubious in his own head. And that‚Äôs that he can be both things - a little bad and a little good and that‚Äôs refreshing to see. So that‚Äôs why I love him.,2024-07-09 03:24:08 GMT

29,Dungeon Meshi,['this used to be about dungeons'  'tutbad'],alexanderwales,I finished Dungeon Meshi after sitting on the last few episodes for too long. Overall I really loved it but it had been recommended to me for a long time as being similar to This Used to be About Dungeons (which I wrote) and I keep trying to figure out whether these are surface similarities (they both features dungeon adventures slice of life stuff certain similarities in the main character) or deeper thematic similarities (found family a focus on mundanity).  If there‚Äôs a thematic core to Dungeon Meshi (at least for the first season) it‚Äôs respecting ecosystems and treating yourself well. If there‚Äôs a thematic core to This Used to be About Dungeons it‚Äôs that young person thing of figuring out who you are.  So to anyone who recommended Meshi to me because of the similarities thanks it was great.

The dog was a gift from Meijack after the split between him and his wife and it was a puppy.  Laios is the only one who actually knows about the dog since it stays with sitters while in the dungeon because he doesn‚Äôt trust the others around his dog and also he wants him to be safe!!! His dog is smart but also Dumb!!! He WILL attack a monster!!! He WILL attack them!!!!  He debates whether to bring him or not to go after Falin but Laios gently asks him will he attack the Red Dragon?? And Chilchuck leaves him with the sitter. It‚Äôs fine they were paid and if it goes longer than planned they know to get Meijack to come out and take care of the floofer.  The dog finds them on the second floor having run off bc it wanted its dad.  Marcille is Baffled.

They were chased out of their home by angry villagers. They did nothing wrong however the villagers were rather insistent on blaming them for everything that went wrong. Malla was pregnant at the time and they were desperately searching for a new home. During their search they found an old dwarven tunnel and decided to follow it. Doing so they found themselves inside a dungeon. They weren‚Äôt planning on settling there just trying to find some help maybe some supplies. Amman was no stranger to combat and could harvest some monster meat if worse came to wear. However the found themselves lost but unlike most the dungeon was giving. when they needed water they found it when they needed food a low level monster would come. They were able to live comfortably settling in an old house on the 4th floor.   Eventually when Malla was nearing her due date the couple stumbled upon an orc camp. The orcs while reluctant at first agreed to trade with them. And soon they became good friends. It was through the tribe that they met a young Senshi who would often sell them vegetable and help teach them to survive. When the time came the orc tribe even helped Malla give birth. They hadn‚Äôt picked a name out afraid that the assult that left them homeless could have killed their unborn baby. The child was born though she was a bit underdeveloped and sickly she was alive. After a week resting at the orc camp the two settled on a name. It was one that Senshi recommended Aznad.   They lived a good life for the first few years senshi would often babysit taking a young Az with him to the upper levels. Life was truly good they even had another child a boy they named Talla. The baby was barely 2 years old when the tragedy happened. They were walking back from a visit to the orcs Talla was asleep in his mother‚Äôs arms. Az now four years old was trailing behind her parents. She was enamored with a doll the orcs had made for her. It looked like her and she had opted to name it Minnie (it was really Mini me). She heard a scream and looked up to see a group of adventurers running full force towards the group weapons drawn. She didn‚Äôt understand what was happening until shot an arrow through her mother‚Äôs wing.  Her eyes widened in horror. The realization dawning on her as she turned and ran. Not even a few steps behind her there was one. He was shorter but she didn‚Äôt care to get a good look at him before covering herself with her wings and running as fast as her little legs could take her ‚Äòyour body is weak it gets hurt easy. When your wrestling with the other orc kids make sure to use your wings. They‚Äôre strong and can take a lot of damage‚Äô her father had told her once after she had sprained her wrist. That along with the tips the orcs had taught her during hide n‚Äô seek and tag she was able to make it out relatively unharmed. While she would realize for a long long time the orcs had internally taught her those tricks knowing that her and her family would eventually targeted.  Back at the camp she frantically rushed towards the chief who had come out to question her. ‚ÄúBad men are chasing me they hurt momma i- they- they shot at her. Why would they do this?‚Äù She broke down sobbing into the arms of another orc who had come to comfort her.   ‚ÄúListen hunny do you remember where you were? Where are your parents now?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe -hic- we were heading home when they- they-‚Äú   ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already got a group heading that way‚Äù one of the orcs commented  ‚ÄúDo you know when the came from?‚Äù   ‚ÄúThe- i think- we were at the edge and they came from- i- this direction‚Äù she lifted up her right hand ‚ÄúI was looking at the- the weird lion fountain thing and they- it was a path on this side‚Äù  She didn‚Äôt know at the time but when the orcs found where they were assaulted they found a path of blood trailing away. The adventures damn monsters The treated her family as animals to be hunted for fun.   In the wake of this tragedy she mostly lived with senshi on the upper levels. The orcs were very very reluctant to let her up there. Even under Senshi‚Äôs watchful eye. Way too many tall men and elves up there. How could they know that she wouldn‚Äôt attack her like they did her parents. But she was a smart child wanted to learn everything there was to know. She couldn‚Äôt do that with them at least not long enough to satisfy her. That and the painful memories were too much and she just couldn‚Äôt live there. She would meet with the orcs when Senshi would deliver them their veggies but aside from that it would take years for her to be able to head back to the old marketplace.

483,Dungeon Meshi,['dungeon meshi spoilers'  'mithrun'  'dungeon meshi analysis'  'text post'],yusiyomogi,in one of my posts i mentioned that people probably mistake mithrun for a tallman sometimes because of his ears and eyes and you know what? something clicked in my mind about him and his character arc.  we know that a big part of his backstory was actually about him trying to be a ‚Äúperfect elf‚Äù to deserve love and how it‚Äôd never brought him happiness and eventually almost destroyed him after he‚Äôd become a lord of the dungeon. and after all that he was effectively rejected by elven society because of his disability and appearance basically not being considered a person anymore. instead it was a tallman who accepted him as a person and gave him reason to live.   and isn‚Äôt it interesting that his arc resolves in him deciding to fully move on from the elven society and starting his new life in a land of short-lived races instead with people he was raised to hold prejudices against. and not a relaxing life of a noble but rather a life of someone who‚Äôs willing to do something dangerous and difficult to help people of this land. i mean especially if he‚Äôll actually decide to open noodle shop someday he‚Äôll have two of the worst jobs ever: monster hunting and food service (lol).   i‚Äôve mentioned before that there‚Äôs something symbolic in the fact that he wears tallman‚Äôs shirt in the end of the manga (aside from all other symbolism of that shirt) and i think this is it. he finally leaves the elves behind to find his new home in melini.,2024-07-09 17:52:14 GMT

The image is from the Adventurer‚Äôs Bible Extras and not the main manga. I don‚Äôt think this meme really spoils anything so I‚Äôm leaving it as unmarked. You can read this as platonic or romantic or whatever you want. It says love but the original image was of a guy and a rat that was like two feet/half a meter long lmfao.   Idk if it‚Äôs obvious or not but this is a reference to the tomato factory two sentence horror story. I was gonna make the second panel say like ‚ÄúHe cooks them‚Äù or ‚ÄúThen I realize I am talking to Laios‚Äù or something but I couldn‚Äôt decide so I just left it blank. Minor Spoilers for Episode 17/Chapter 38:  Spoilers for Episode 23/Chapter 49:  This isn‚Äôt a spoiler or reference but you won‚Äôt really know who he is unless you‚Äôve read the manga. He makes an appearance in Episode 21/Chapter 45 but I don‚Äôt even remember if his name was said. The manga definitely goes into more detail about him so if you‚Äôre curious I‚Äôd recommend reading it! Or you could wait for the anime to come out that‚Äôs chill too. Anyways the following memes will contain spoilers for anime onlys! If you‚Äôre anime only and don‚Äôt want to be spoiled please do not scroll past this Mithrun!   If you‚Äôre a manga reader but you haven‚Äôt finished reading the manga spoiler warnings will still be in color!

I made sure to do so by sitting through the end of the Gundam panel and the whole Terminator Zero panel to make sure I was in the room (they don‚Äôt clear between panels). The terminator anime actually does look pretty cool! Jacki from Anime News Network was hosting and she‚Äôs so enthusiastic you get swept up. I did feel bad she kept commenting on how big the crowd was when I‚Äôm pretty sure at least half had the same idea I had and were there for Dunmeshi. But hopefully it got people who wouldn‚Äôt have considered it (like me I do like Terminator but it wasn‚Äôt on my radar) interested!  As has gone around the internet the panel got hijacked by a guy carrying a boom box and waving an anarchy flag and a person singing (badly). It was very confusing they got on stage and at first I thought it was part of the show but then I realized the singing person was shirtless and had their tits out under the jacket they were wearing and was like probably not. Someone in the audience mentioned it was a Panty and Stocking song. They were demanding we dance we all realized they weren‚Äôt supposed to be there and started booing. A guy behind me yelled ‚Äúyou‚Äôre being disrespectful!!!‚Äù which I thought was a very wholesome reaction. They proceeded to flip us all off. People were yelling ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs security‚Äù and they finally came and slowly hauled them away. The person said ‚Äúsomething something gay something‚Äù and someone yelled something back and I guess it‚Äôs a good thing my hearing is bad. As they were hauled off they deliberately opened their jacket and flashed their tits as like a screw you like we all hadn‚Äôt already seen them.  Fortunately Trigger staff weren‚Äôt on the stage as this happened just the host (who I felt bad for). The director Yoshihiro Miyajima and character designer Naoki Takeda came out and one of them joked ‚Äúwhat a special guest!‚Äù  Now onto the stuff that actually matters:  We were shown a ton of concept art (no lines all colors can‚Äôt remember what that‚Äôs called) and everyone screamed like crazy when it got to Marcille and Falin in the bath. There were quite a few screams for necromancer Marcille. Unfortunately we weren‚Äôt allowed to take pix.  There was also a live draw for the characters. We were allowed to pick two by yelling out who we wanted (I yelled Marcille and Falin) There was a huge coordinated chant for Senshi but that was kind of ignored and they chose Marcille and Izutsumi. We did get to take a picture of that:  The producer was actually recording the whole panel for a future Youtube vid walking among the audience (he almost fell getting off the stage at one point which was a little scary since he was pretty elderly) and he was so enthusiastic and adorable.  Fans got to line up and ask questions and some notable ones I wrote down:  What monster would you eat if you were in the dungeon? ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want to eat any of it honestly but if I had to choose the Red Dragon‚Äù.  ‚ÄúWhich part of Falin would you want to eat if you had to?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe dragon portion definitely.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhich part?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe thighs look delicious. I want to make it clear I‚Äôm talking about the dragon here‚Äù.  Someone asked about the added Senshi panty shots and the director responded ‚Äúvery keen‚Äù. And then said to ask the animators because they were the ones who added them. He also said ‚Äúlook forward to the future‚Äù.  After the picture was finished one of them mentioned that Izutsumi was just like their cat who runs away whenever he tried to pet it.  I did try to get into the Bocchi panel since it was just upstairs and an hour after Dunmeshi finished but they made us go outside the building and come back in I guess to be fair but that obviously meant I got there too late. I waited in line but it was capped.,2024-07-09 18:06:15 GMT

Shuro says everything a compelling shounen love interest would use in a shoujo manga and confesses all the shit and is even mildly heroic in his attempts to find her.   and Falin is 100% not interested. And he just has to deal with it.   Marcille‚Äôs attentions and effort are just prioritized in the mind of Falin. like this is the first time I can remember really seeing that dynamic genderbent in something so mainstream. I thought I hated unrequited love dynamics but I think I‚Äôm just fucking sick of seeing it play out in favor of the hetero person when the ‚Äòfriend‚Äô to the side is putting equal if not more effort (with no ‚Äòguarantee‚Äô of payback) but simply for love into the wellness of the other person. (which is fine that‚Äôs the dynamic but it‚Äôs overplayed)   Not to mention that Shuro‚Äôs love for Falin results in this idea that if she‚Äôs not the pure human he thought she was then the only possible mercy is to report it to the cops and put her down like an animal ‚Äî as if that‚Äôs his rightful choice due to his infatuation with her ‚Äî where Marcille‚Äôs only motivation is the desperation to bring Falin back and hear her voice purity and propriety be absolutely damned.,2024-07-09 19:50:38 GMT

It doesn‚Äôt matter how long you talk about your interests for. Hell Laios probably makes the conversation longer because of how many questions he asks about it.

If you feel particularly embarrassed about your interest whether people ostracizing you for it or what not Laios would comfort you. ‚ÄúWhat you love shouldn‚Äôt be dictated by other people. You should stay true to yourself and what makes YOU happy!‚Äù Laios would most def make you a monstersona in his journal and/or even saying certain aspects of monsters remind him of you (bad or good you decide) Vice versa you‚Äôd tell Laios about how certain things about your interest remind you of him and he‚Äôd get super excited! Not only do you think about him but you think about him enough to tie him into something you hold close to you! After a long day of dungeon crawling the party tries to sleep. Keyword is try because Laios and you are almost up all night going happily back and forth about your interests you noticed during the day. Think of it like a silly sleepover. At least whoevers on watch duty has something to listen to. Laios would happily assign dog characteristics and breeds to you. You‚Äôd suggest adopting dogs that resemble the both of you once you‚Äôre all out of the dungeon for good and that makes him ecstatic.,2024-07-09 19:35:16 GMT

675,Dungeon Meshi,['delicious in dungeon'  'dunmeshi'  'pattadol'  'mithrun'  'the canaries'  'cithis'  'not a ship post'  'the daydream hour'],eyebrow-incident,Pattadol and Mithrun‚Äôs friendship is really sweet.  They both have the same deep seated insecurity / resentment about being the sibling who was chosen to join the canaries the least favorite of the family. I doubt they ever spoke to each other about this but it‚Äôs an interesting parallel. They‚Äôre connected in this way though they may not know it.  Pretty soon after she‚Äôs introduced in the manga we see Pattadol stand up for Mithrun when the other canaries are teasing him.  Her insistence that the other canaries show respect to him at first seems like just a side effect of her deference to authority but it turns out she really does respect him and thinks he‚Äôs capable.  When Mithrun was missing for 6 days Pattadol was clearly incredibly stressed and worried for him. Look how frazzled she looks by the time he gets rescued none of her usual meticulous hairstyling in place and how relieved she is to see him safe and alive.  It‚Äôs notable that the first time Mithrun disobeyed one of Cithis‚Äô commands was when she told him to hurt Pattadol.   He claims it‚Äôs because he would get kicked out of the canaries but would he really risk getting kicked out if he made it look like an accident? At this point in time he‚Äôs not aware yet that he can form new desires so he probably didn‚Äôt realize that this resistance came from a genuine desire he had not to hurt his friend.   Pattadol is the one who creates the dungeon master support group after the events of the manga. The fact that she went out of her way to do so that is a very sweet show of support for Mithrun and a sign that she cares deeply about his wellbeing.  And Mithrun seems to genuinely appreciate her efforts referring to her as one of the people in his life whose love fills the hole and acknowledging that he‚Äôs lucky.  I just think they‚Äôre neat.,2024-07-09 21:32:41 GMT

'kabru'  'kabru of utaya'],homicidal-lingonberry,a few weeks ago I was thinking way too hard about tarot and dungeon meshi. and how a lot of times artists who want to make tarot fan art kind of choose somewhat shallow interpretations simply based off the card name or a single interpretation. and I said to multiple people that I KNOW someone is going to do Marcille as the Magician even though she is 0% magician. and I have just seen it. I cant believe I called it.   (this isnt to diss an artist the art was good and I did like it! just from a tarot perspective its a bit off. Im about to be a nerd about this.)   see what people fail to recognize about magicians‚Ä¶they do not do magic they perform tricks!   the character I think is best suited for the magician is Kabru actually! the magician card embodies all 4 suits of tarot and brings them together. this is going to be someone who can be very cold and calculating AND warm and charming. its gemini energy and kabru is a gemini.  the magician is resourceful and uses a lot of different tactics and tools to complete their goals. not strength or logic or heart alone but someone who carefully selects the right tools in the right moment. they are 4d chess players plotters always 10 steps ahead.   Marcille is wonderful but this is not her. she wears her heart on her sleeve and her idea of a good tactical move is Make Explosion Bigger. she very much embodies heart and soul and while she is book smart she seems to have trouble properly applying her knowledge in a practical way at times. she is endearingly clumsy. she is probably the opposite of a magician shes far too sweet to wield the magicians cold logic effectively and too genuine to be truly charismatic. shes a weird girl. I love her. shes better for not being a magician.,2024-07-09 21:32:32 GMT

Please let me know your thoughts and my asks are open!  Word count: ~600 words  Content: Fluff talks of food Laois x female reader reader is a merchant  You had met Laios in the local market. Being a produce vendor he would often visit your stall in search of fresh vegetables and with some curious questions. ‚ÄúHmm do you think this would go well with roasted basilisk?‚Äù ‚ÄúDungeon scorpion is very sea-foody! Do you have any carrots today?‚Äù Initially you were a bit taken aback at his straightforwardness regarding eating monsters ‚ÄúWhat? They are living beings too so what says we can‚Äôt eat them?‚Äù He once replied very matter-of-factly tilting his head to look at you when you had pointed out how weird this eating habit of his was. You had shrugged in acceptance of his explanation and you can never forget the way his eyes shone with appreciation. Since then he would stop by your stall even more frequently. The topic of conversation slowly drifting from mere vegetable requests to recounting his adventures in the dungeon until one day he invited you to cook with him! ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure your extensive knowledge of produce would be amazing in experimenting with new things! I have some of the mollusks from living armor that I am sure would make amazing skewers!‚Äù he blurted out his hand rubbing at the hilt of his sword. The situation was extremely unusual for you but you had to admit his stories had made you curious about trying all of these foods. So that evening after closing your stall and making a detour to your home to freshen up you followed him into the forest near the entrance of the dungeon. ‚ÄúYou can only truly enjoy dungeon food if you cook out in the open‚Äù he had explained softly setting a leisurely pace by your side before you reached a small clearing. You finally unloaded the sack you carried with various fresh vegetables along with some herbs while Laois made quick work of starting a fire. He collected twigs which you helped him clean to use as skewer sticks before he finally revealed the mollusks and you ventured a finger to touch them feeling them retract under the pressure. He smiled at the way your face lit up with curiosity at the new animals growing even more eager to cook them for you. ‚ÄúHow do you think we should go about making the skewers? A piece of veggie in between every piece of meat or more separation?‚Äù he asked deep in thought. After a very detailed conversation on the flavor profile of each ingredient you settled on alternating vegetable and meat and letting the skewers bask in the perfect blend of spices before roasting them. Before you knew it the scent of tenderly cooked meat and roasted vegetables filled the air of the clearing your faces illuminated by both the pale moonlight and the warm coals of the fire. Laios leaned down to retrieve the cooked skewers and offered you the first bite. You made an appreciative sound at the taste of the food melting on your tongue and urged him to try some himself. ‚ÄúWhoa! The sweetness of the tomatoes really balances how savory the meat is. And the garlic marinade just brings everything together!‚Äù he commented holding a hand over his chest as he looked at the food in admiration. You chuckled a bit at his passion and the admirative smile was soon directed at you. This certainly would not be the last of your cooking adventures.,2024-07-10 01:20:00 GMT

151,Dungeon Meshi,['labru'  'kabru'  'laios touden'],toothlickpick,okay you know what fine. my thoughts on labru are expansive and endless i guess  there are people on certain websites from certain ships who are very adamant that labru has no material reason to exist and thats fundamentally not true. even in the most charitable take labru is at the very least one sided and kabru clearly has an obsession with laios. he actively investigates laios before the dude even knew him to find out more about his motives and trappings. he goes out of his way to befriend laios even triggering his own trauma against monsters in the process. when mithrun is describing his experience as a dungeon lord kabru is more invested in refining it to make sense to laios than he is in actually emotionally connecting with the story.  the appeal of labru is the fact that laios learns over the course of the story to appreciate kabru as one of his only tallman male friends.   kabru is the polar opposite of shuro in terms of his relationship with laios‚Äìif shuro secretly resents laios kabru secretly cares for laios in a way that only becomes clear when his cool-guy persona fades and he confesses his true motivations. kabru has a lot of mixed feelings about laios and its a running gag that he secretly needs to kill laios but the reason why he doesn‚Äôt isnt because he cant (he‚Äôs a capable human killer) its because he genuinely wants to be his friend.   in exchange laios thinks of kabru in a positive light not only because kabru makes the effort to please him but because hes a genuine person who wants companionship. laios has his trauma surrounding shuro but when he gets punched for a second time by a tallman man but this time find out its because the tallman likes him he immediately regards kabru in a different light. its also why kabru acts as a proto-advisor to laios by the post-canon end of the series‚Äìlaios wants to put his trust into kabru.  like idk about you but im here for labru to see kabru deal with his monster trauma and become more open to showing off his vulnerable side to the most autistic man on the plan. im here for labru to see laios learn to appreciate humans as he does monsters and find genuine love and friendship from a cruel world of unwritten rules he doesnt understand. im here for labru not only for the narrative foils but for the complimentary foibles.  (also kabru needs to get railed so bad but thats neither here nor there),2024-07-10 02:21:40 GMT
69,Dungeon Meshi,['marcille donato'  'marcille dungeon meshi'  'dungeon meshi spoilers'],fandom-flight,I‚Äôve been thinking about Marcille and carelessness. Carelessness is how Laios identified the real Marcille during the Shapeshifter encounter and it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs really central to her character arc. Marcille‚Äôs carelessness about the environment gets her scolded by Senshi multiple times and he always takes a moment to lecture her about how important it is to respect nature and its systems. The food web and ecological balance is brought up as something to consider even in moments of life or death and disregarding her impact on nature gets Marcille into her most notable trouble. It may sound like I‚Äôm talking about the Undine but in fact I think it‚Äôs her tendency to prioritize her comfort and convenience over nature that leads her to becoming the dungeon lord. She‚Äôs so afraid of being alone that she would force everyone to live for a thousand years and drastically disrupt the way the world works. Her fear of her loved ones dying before her leads her to pursue magic that has made an entire kingdom of people miserable and not once did she ever think about the logistics of how to handle a society that doesn‚Äôt have people who are born and die at the rate that nature expects. While I do think there‚Äôs a conversation to be had about whether it would be socially equalizing for her to do this in a world where some people live to be 500 while others only get to 50 I do think it‚Äôs incredibly fascinating how Ryoko Kui built this minor character flaw into the crux of the story. Being careless for small things may not seem like a huge issue but if you let that carelessness carry over into bigger things then the consequences can be catastrophic. It‚Äôs only when Marcille hears from all her friends that she needs to be empathetic and not just steamroll over people with her own desires that she‚Äôs able to calm down and come back to herself after all,2024-07-10 02:20:48 GMT

22,Dungeon Meshi,['kabru of utaya'  'kabru dungeon meshi'  'random morning thoughts are always the best. i just woke up btw so good morning'],comfysofti,Very randomly thought of concept of Kabru becoming a dungeon lord  I think he‚Äôs wish/main desire would be something like ‚Äúi wish to understand humans. From outside to the very essence of their being‚Äù considering his ‚Äúobsession‚Äù with observing and learning about fellow humans. With time as demon/winged lion would eat away at his other desires only leaving one i think he‚Äôs only desire/wish in the end would be ‚Äúi wish to understand humans desires‚Äù. I think winged lion would exploit this  Also since winged lion did changed his appearance quite a few times depending on dungeon lords i can see him taking shape of a horned cat with no readable features besides it‚Äôs eyes. Basically a walking silhouette of a black cat with horns only it‚Äôs bright pupil-less yellow eyes staring at him. As he grew i can see the ‚Äúsilhouette‚Äù growing wings or something sharp on the body like spikes long fans or tail with a sharp end  Silly concept because I don‚Äôt think Kabru would really take the role of dungeon lord(mainly because of risk of repeating Utaya)but ya know. I can let my imagination wander :33  Also this is probably really ooc but meh i just like imagining different scenarios like this  When I‚Äôll have time I‚Äôll draw him and add this here(probably)  Edit: dungeon lord Kabru is real i drew him the art in question is here,2024-07-10 07:09:21 GMT

17,Dungeon Meshi,[],loving-n0t-heyting,Not sure if im being ‚Äúboss baby vibes‚Äù about it but so far (on ch. 22 rn) dunmeshi bears a lot of big picture similarity to made in abyss? A journey to the depths of a lush and vibrant underground dubgeon‚Äîthe basis of the local scavenging economy with a major focus on its internal economy/society and ecosystem‚Äîby a ragtag adventuring team to find their leaders lost relative at the bottom. (And late appearing kemonomimi!) Even the monster hunting/cooking aspect shows up in both tho obviously its more foregrounded in dunmeshi  (The art in both is very good but very different: tsukushi-san is more ornate and picturebook-esque whereas ryoko kui leans in a sort of pared down toon-y direction)  So far the tone is much less harsh than in MiA tho which goes along with less of a coherent philosophical vision its trying to articulate. And its tropey-er with a lot of the worldbuilding piggybacking on D&amp;D cliches instead of crafting it from scratch as in mia. And ofc it is less‚Ä¶ yk‚Ä¶. unsettlingly-to-most-ppl horny.

1,Dungeon Meshi,['oc'  'dungeon meshi oc'  'dunmeshi oc'  'illustration'  'larp oc'],kohiiflux,‚ÄúI have passed a hundredth years people come and go. We should let them be at peace.  I made my LARP (yes I joined larping for a while never got good at it) OC into dungeon meshi character ! So her name in this dunmeshi AU is Blythe Bolingbroke but her larp surname is actually Boymbroke (Boy-I‚Äôm-Broke). Similar to the larp OC she is a half elf/half-tall-man.  Following Kui‚Äôs characterization of characters instead of being ultra extroverted and - you know- the mainstay personality of ALL bards in a lot of DnD campaigns (roll nat 20 to seduce the succubi dragon and every single creature in existence)  she is stoic and solemn. She is 100 years old in tall man age (25 in half elf years mentally in her 30s)  Her elf mother served as a court mage in Izhganda and fell in love with a tall-man merc the second son of a tall man nobility but the union did not last. She has a tall-man younger half brother who is now 90 years old and seemingly cannot die due to his half sister‚Äôs quarter life crisis especially in her decision to visit the island on a gap year soul searching journey.  As Blythe is raised by her human kin she has a different outlook in life than Marcille. (as long as there are community you can still remember them by heart or something something nothing is more important than family).  her role in dungeon is to let non monster humanoid souls rest in peace with her music (with a price of course) usually family members send what music the deceased adventurers like. Usually happens in low levels.   She has no qualms in eating monsters so long they are of similar to plants or animals (basilisk ? ok. barometz? awesome ! walking fungi? fantastic!! treasure bugs? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. living armor (she doesnt know it is a mollusk)? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. no. spirits ? Blasphemy !? Humanoid monster? -screams to the heavens-!  Her party members consists of the descendants of short living races that she trusted.  Stone the second is the grandson of her first kobold teammate stone the first. Stone the first‚Äôs daughter Onyx is retired and living her old age life as a maid in Blythe‚Äôs brother stronghold.     Kenthill Sam is a half-foot that Blythe hired and mentored in tactics. Blythe had a promise with his grandma to protect her kin (I believe in the headcanon of that there are a lot of half-foot exploitations).,2024-07-10 14:58:36 GMT

I almost cried. Is eating monsters the solution to everything boy??But it made sense after he explained so yeah Kabru is a little entitled. Who tf does he think he is? Who made him the king selector? But I still love him though melanin king Young Senshi was such a cutie patootie and seeing a little of his backstory explains why he‚Äôs so obsessed with feeding kids. Chilchuck go back home your family needs you tf Those elves that Kabru and that guy who‚Äôs in love with Falin Shuro met were so pretty  Marcille in that pretty dress!! And like does Marcille like Laois or is she easily flustered?  I was so happy seeing Izutsumi in the intro! Locked all the way in Chilchuck beefs with almost everyone  Marcille and Laois saying Chil has a mean look in his eye. You guys thought he was pookie bear coded? Laois is dangerously optimistic.

There‚Äôs a house further in past a line of trees a remnant of life before this district was repurposed overgrown with ivy and with a roof half caved in. It‚Äôs as good a place as any.  Laios rams into the door shoulder first busting the lock and slams it shut behind him. He drags a weathered dusty dresser in front of the door knocking over portraits of a family long dead and presses it flush against the doorway to hold it. He ransacks the house for heavy objects finding a few rusted cast iron pans to drop on the dresser and stick behind the legs. The hole in the roof won‚Äôt do but most people wouldn‚Äôt be brave enough to scale it and drop down in on a guy who might be armed.  Chilchuck isn‚Äôt most people. While Laios is trying to seal the windows he slides through busted shingles to drop onto the floor his slight body weight allowing him to weather the fall landing catlike on his feet.   ‚ÄúChil‚Äù Laios shudders. ‚ÄúThank God it‚Äôs you I-‚Äú  Fat hot tears roll down Chilchuck‚Äôs cheeks leaving clean tracks in the grime. He smiles.  ‚ÄúHey Laios.‚Äù He reaches for a holster strapped to his thigh. ‚ÄúLong time no see.‚Äù  &lt;!-- more --&gt; ‚ÄúChil‚Äù Laios breathes. ‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt be-‚Äú  Chilchuck loads the bullets in his revolver one by one nearly dropping a few.  ‚ÄúLooks like I got a sponsor after all‚Äù he grins licking the salt of his quivering lips. He holds the gun at arms length hand shaking as he lifts his thumb to pull back the hammer on the gun with a resonant click. ‚ÄúI was positive it would have been you.‚Äù  ‚ÄúChil‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt.‚Äù  Chilchuck‚Äôs finger twitches. He won‚Äôt put it on the trigger.  ‚ÄúThey said my daughters would be set for life‚Äù he grinds out. ‚ÄúIf I killed you.‚Äù  Laios eyes go wide. His mouth closes.  ‚ÄúCan you trust them?‚Äù Laios asks.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Chilchuck shakes his head. He draws some tears off his face with a thumb. ‚ÄúBut the sponsors are vetted aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù  Laios hands clench and unclench. He squeezes his fist so tightly his knuckles go white and then he releases again.  ‚ÄúSo I guess that‚Äôs that then‚Äù Laios breathes out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I wish this could have gone differently.‚Äù  More tears bubble out of Chilchuck‚Äôs eyes as Laios lowers himself to sit cross-legged on the floor.  ‚ÄúI know you love them Chil. I know how hard things have been for your family.‚Äù The gun is shaking so much that Laios can hear the cylinder rattling. ‚ÄúTake the shot.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing Laios‚Äù Chilchuck sobs. His arm drops. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been a selfish bastard.‚Äù,2024-07-10 17:04:56 GMT

That is not true. The point is that having a special interest is not incompatible with caring. Continuing to eat and rest and live is not incompatible with caring. Realising that Kabru is right about Falin‚Äôs life not being more important than other people‚Äôs lives is not incompatible with caring.   Also Laois masks heavily specifically in terms of expressing or allowing himself to feel negative emotions. He keeps smiling and he keeps taking care of others.   Laois does not always express his emotions in a socially expected way or feel exactly what a neurotypical in his place would probably feel. That is not the same thing as not caring. He cares so so much.,2024-07-10 20:51:35 GMT

You guys are aware that Laios eats monsters the way people would like. Eat animals right? He‚Äôs not crazy or stupid or sadistic or anything. He has a special interest and it‚Äôs monsters.   Furthermore his past having himself and his sister be shunned for their interests in the abnormal made him develop a distaste for humanity. Laios has just thought monsters were way cooler since he was a kid and Falin really looked up for him for his dedication to his interests and personal code of moral ethics. He never loved his sister less for her abilities he admired her for what made her different. Because he‚Äôs fucking awesome and they‚Äôre autistic as hell‚Ä¶. they both went through so damn much. Laios never fit into the military into his hometown he barely fit into most groups of adventurers since he met Marcille chilchuck and company and two of the members of that original party didn‚Äôt care enough to join him. His feeling of worthlessness to his friends in the beginning of the story are enough to make him imagine a whole scenario in between major chapters where he was the one who was eaten.. and he thought nobody except Falin would care enough to save him.  Point being Laios has a much richer character that goes ALONGSIDE his special interest in monsters. Which honestly is more comparable to like. A fucking biologist. Not a monsterfucker not a cannibal none of that shit. Monsterfuckers are cool as a monsterfucker but he‚Äôs not one.. he‚Äôs more like a furry man‚Ä¶. And he‚Äôs not stupid he‚Äôs just. Autistic. Why are we making autistic characters with a silly side seem stupid? Everyone has dumb moments sure but like.. he‚Äôs really smart guys‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs such a good leader outside of his ability to listen to his party members. Don‚Äôt fall for the mischaracterization of Laios that his party members originally set for him before major important arcs guys‚Ä¶  And Kabru. Oh my God. Kabru. Kabru is also autistic but for humans social interactions and culture‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a nerd for politics and the humanities and I‚Äôll avoid saying much more to avoid spoilers for non-manga readers but you‚Äôll see more of that as time passes. But he‚Äôs not the type to be easily flustered. Laios only gets to him not even because he‚Äôs that difficult to read but because he catches him off guard. He‚Äôs an interesting critter bro. And Kabru definitely sees that. It takes time to respect that but within a period of time he learns to see him as a relatively competent adventurer and places a lot of faith from him. On some level this guy has learned to understand this very interesting autistic guy who is forward with his feelings that a very autistic Kabru hasn‚Äôt learned to understand. That‚Äôs what makes their relationship so cool man. He‚Äôs not cold in reality (though people may perceive him that way due to backstory motivations and attitude within the dungeon) but he‚Äôs a lot more serious than this‚Ä¶ c&#x27;mon guys.. let‚Äôs be a little real here please‚Ä¶. at this point I barely like Labru anymore because they‚Äôve been so like. Babied. Woobified. Whatever the word is man. I‚Äôm starting to appreciate their friendship more as a friendship now because I just think the beautiful qualities I saw in their romance have been sort of overlooked or misinterpreted. Nowadays I just think their platonic relationship is beautiful. Sighs.     Farcille is awesome though and these girls are awesome slay  -  Edit: hey guys I wanna address a couple of things here! For one this isn‚Äôt intended to be ship hate. Labru is a perfectly valid ship - rather I‚Äôm just not a fan of how deep the mischaracterization of both characters runs and how it results in the subsequent babying of their relationship. While it‚Äôs driven me personally away from the romance a bit I have no problem with the ship itself. Additionally Farcille has its own issues with woobification that could use some addressing I just haven‚Äôt had to see as much mischaracterization on my feeds. Maybe in a future post I‚Äôll address some of my personal peeves with many people‚Äôs characterization of Farcille ESPECIALLY Falin.,2024-07-11 01:36:30 GMT

Telling you that you look nice today with a gentle blush and a downcast gaze.

Senshi of Izganda who is direct with how he feels. He‚Äôs calm and reassuring‚Äìhis love for you is so blatantly obvious but doesn‚Äôt have to be constantly expressed. He takes care of small things like dishes and housework without being asked because taking care of your shared space is an act of love in itself.  Kabru of Utaya who seems so perfect on the outside yet you‚Äôre aware of what lies beneath the surface‚Äìand he‚Äôs okay with that.

247,Dungeon Meshi,['dunmeshi'  'dungeon meshi spoilers'  'delicious in dungeon'  'text'  'rant'  'labru'  'laios touden'  'kabru of utaya'  'i got something to say'],emilibro,Ughhh I‚Äôm so sorry to be an ass but I see so much popular art on tumblr and around the internet that really woobifies both Laios and Kabru and their relationship especially when they‚Äôre together‚Ä¶. You guys are aware that Laios eats monsters the way people would like. Eat animals right? He‚Äôs not crazy or stupid or sadistic or anything. He has a special interest and it‚Äôs monsters.   Furthermore his past having himself and his sister be shunned for their interests in the abnormal made him develop a distaste for humanity. Laios has just thought monsters were way cooler since he was a kid and Falin really looked up for him for his dedication to his interests and personal code of moral ethics. He never loved his sister less for her abilities he admired her for what made her different. Because he‚Äôs fucking awesome and they‚Äôre autistic as hell‚Ä¶. they both went through so damn much. Laios never fit into the military into his hometown he barely fit into most groups of adventurers since he met Marcille chilchuck and company and two of the members of that original party didn‚Äôt care enough to join him. His feeling of worthlessness to his friends in the beginning of the story are enough to make him imagine a whole scenario in between major chapters where he was the one who was eaten.. and he thought nobody except Falin would care enough to save him.  Point being Laios has a much richer character that goes ALONGSIDE his special interest in monsters. Which honestly is more comparable to like. A fucking biologist. Not a monsterfucker not a cannibal none of that shit. Monsterfuckers are cool as a monsterfucker but he‚Äôs not one.. he‚Äôs more like a furry man‚Ä¶. And he‚Äôs not stupid he‚Äôs just. Autistic. Why are we making autistic characters with a silly side seem stupid? Everyone has dumb moments sure but like.. he‚Äôs really smart guys‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs such a good leader outside of his ability to listen to his party members. Don‚Äôt fall for the mischaracterization of Laios that his party members originally set for him before major important arcs guys‚Ä¶  And Kabru. Oh my God. Kabru. Kabru is also autistic but for humans social interactions and culture‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a nerd for politics and the humanities and I‚Äôll avoid saying much more to avoid spoilers for non-manga readers but you‚Äôll see more of that as time passes. But he‚Äôs not the type to be easily flustered. Laios only gets to him not even because he‚Äôs that difficult to read but because he catches him off guard. He‚Äôs an interesting critter bro. And Kabru definitely sees that. It takes time to respect that but within a period of time he learns to see him as a relatively competent adventurer and places a lot of faith from him. On some level this guy has learned to understand this very interesting autistic guy who is forward with his feelings that a very autistic Kabru hasn‚Äôt learned to understand. That‚Äôs what makes their relationship so cool man. He‚Äôs not cold in reality (though people may perceive him that way due to backstory motivations and attitude within the dungeon) but he‚Äôs a lot more serious than this‚Ä¶ c&#x27;mon guys.. let‚Äôs be a little real here please‚Ä¶. at this point I barely like Labru anymore because they‚Äôve been so like. Babied. Woobified. Whatever the word is man. I‚Äôm starting to appreciate their friendship more as a friendship now because I just think the beautiful qualities I saw in their romance have been sort of overlooked or misinterpreted. Nowadays I just think their platonic relationship is beautiful. Sighs.     Farcille is awesome though and these girls are awesome slay  -  Edit: hey guys I wanna address a couple of things here! For one this isn‚Äôt intended to be ship hate. Labru is a perfectly valid ship - rather I‚Äôm just not a fan of how deep the mischaracterization of both characters runs and how it results in the subsequent babying of their relationship. While it‚Äôs driven me personally away from the romance a bit I have no problem with the ship itself. Additionally Farcille has its own issues with woobification that could use some addressing I just haven‚Äôt had to see as much mischaracterization on my feeds. Maybe in a future post I‚Äôll address some of my personal peeves with many people‚Äôs characterization of Farcille ESPECIALLY Falin.,2024-07-11 01:36:30 GMT

443,Dungeon Meshi,['dungeon meshi manga spoilers'  'laois touden'  'kabru of utaya'  'labru'  'well i guess this is labru inspirational'],awarmbowlofhomemadesoup,Someone pointed out how Laois has significant connections that can influence how the races run the dungeon. And I think that‚Äôs one of the reasons why Kabru initially had a neutral-low opinion about Laois.   Let‚Äôs look at this from Kabru‚Äôs perspective.   They‚Äôre on the island. It has a dungeon.  Whoever controls the dungeon controls the island.  The island‚Äôs economy depends on the number of adventurers entering and leaving the dungeon.   Adventurers who go further than most are renowned for being closer to the island‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican dream‚Äù: anyone who defeats the mad magician gets to inherit the land.   Add to the fact that the governor and dwarven shadow ruler on the island exploit this dream despite the history of what happens when adventurers keep trespassing dungeons (Kabru‚Äôs homeland Utaya included).   Now from Kabru‚Äôs perspective before they became friends Laois has:  2 magic academy graduates which are rare on the island. The half-foots‚Äô union head (I doubt many parties are willing to pay in full upfront). Somehow dragged a mysterious Eastern swordsman with them. Whether or not Laois was aware of it he has connections to the island‚Äôs black market. Dwarf daughter of the ex-weapons head of the island (reputation not-so-good but she is known). Plus Laois is the son of a village chief but somehow is rumored to be a prince (lol).  ALT Put all of this together and Laois as a leader has 1.) the capability to go further in the dungeon and 2.) the political and underground influence with the potential to grow and challenge that of their government give or take a few years.  ALT Kabru tried to speak to Laois so that he knew how to work around him but whether Laois missed the social cues that someone wanted to talk to him or Laois was closed off to strangers due to history Kabru never had the chance.  ALT And maybe that‚Äôs what made Kabru dismiss the Touden siblings for not being good and honest people. For all his capabilities and connections Laois could turn the island in a new direction yet he does not seem to care to do so.  ALT But in the end Kabru realized. No he‚Äôs just unaware because he has one thing in his mind. The very thing Kabru hates.  ALT  Good luck anime Kabru.,2024-07-11 03:29:12 GMT

They ran through civilization rarely with a discernible beginning and rarely noticed by anyone but those who approached them. They were tangled and knotted and digging into the skin of society‚Äî and when released the mark they left was red bruising.     You wanted to snap one of those lines. You wanted to run it across your palm wrap your fingers around it and squeeze. You wanted to watch the tension grow to tear it apart to leave it ragged and broken and ready to be yours.     Yours as you were his.     You felt the fine line grow taut as Mithrun‚Äôs good eye searched your face. You‚Äôd done something bad. His chest rose and fell as he held himself up with both arms on either side of you. Those arms could‚Äôve been the bars of a jail cell or the columns of a temple. His palms were flat on the cold ground his fingers were splayed one knee was between your legs and you were doing your best to make no noise.     Mithrun‚Äôs good eye narrowed. He was doing his job he was the Captain. You could only wonder if he ever stopped being the Captain if he was ever just Mithrun. Knowing him most likely not. Another line. Did he ever let it bend?    As if he could see through your skull and right into your brain his shoulders tensed and his lips twitched. He knew. He always knew. You inhaled through your nose with hyper-awareness of the rise and fall of your chest. You were far too considerate of how precisely how little room there was between Mithrun and yourself. He smelled like basic soap like familiarity.     ‚ÄúYou did something stupid‚Äù Mithrun broke the silence. He didn‚Äôt sound particularly perturbed by the fact that you‚Äôd done something stupid but you caught the hint of gravel the hint of a rough scratch in his throat that told you all you needed to know.     You knew. You always knew. His shoulders relaxed a little as if saying his thoughts aloud helped him come to terms with it.     The truth was: you did a lot of stupid things. Despite the self-awareness you possessed upon the matter you still did them. The source was not genuine stupidity but rather a quality that you and Mithrun shared; single-minded determination. You thought he‚Äôd understand.     You managed to raise your right hand and gently press it against his chest. Yet no amount of pressure would push him back. He steeled himself and leaned in closer shoulders rising as silver curls fell forward to brush across his jawline.     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù you argued and you could not help but avoid the black-eyed gaze that dug through your brain. You settled for glaring at a misshapen brick on the wall of the dungeon.     Mithrun seemed to relent. He sat up on his knees and folded his arms over his chest though you were still on your back in front of him. You‚Äôd ended up in that position by accident. You did not stay in that position by accident. It was like pulling teeth but you ripped your eyes away from the wall and looked up at him. The rays of the light spell above washed him in pale yellow. And the fine line regained its strength with every inch of space created between your bodies.     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fortunate I was there‚Äù Mithrun observed with the nonchalance of someone who believed he did not care.     That was what you knew so well; Mithrun could care. Mithrun could desire. He wasn‚Äôt aware of that but even if he were he wouldn‚Äôt bother with it. What point was there in desiring anything unrelated to the demon?     Another line though it was not fine like the others. The Captain had simplified himself so much. And simple things were easy to understand. If it didn‚Äôt involve revenge he did not care. That was a line you knew you could not bend twist or snap. You didn‚Äôt try.    However you did walk it like a tight-rope.     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm perfectly capable of taking care of myself‚Äù you informed him. You weren‚Äôt sure how you sounded most likely defiant most likely argumentative. Judging by how he slightly tilted his head at you it was one of those two descriptors. Yet the room to care had run out. Your rooms were filled with fire flames licking at every inch of you and turning you into ash. Your lower abdomen felt as if it was a rubber band being pulled.     You liked being pulled.     ‚ÄúYou put people in danger‚Äù Mithrun responded almost immediately ‚Äúyou could‚Äôve died.‚Äù    He said the word ‚Äòdied‚Äô as if he wanted to spit it in the dirt.     You and Mithrun had been separated from the Canaries and your party on account of your own horrible decision making. You couldn‚Äôt quite recall what you had done. Was it pathetic that all you knew was Mithrun‚Äôs arm around your waist as he yanked you away? One track-minded surely but Mithrun had the ability to create new far more exciting tracks to follow.     He‚Äôd teleported you both to a room nearby. It was stone and smelled of dust and hints of green moss crawled up the walls like desperate fingers. You were most likely the one who desired the room into existence a spot for Mithrun to teleport to where you could be alone together. If it was anyone else Mithrun would‚Äôve been on his feet and determinedly searching for the exit by then.    But you knew. How could you not know? Mithrun never hid his feelings; a blessing and a curse for all involved.     The line appeared again and it was not the thick simple line that you could never bend. The line that settled between you and the Captain was thin and weak and just asking to be torn apart. Without a second thought the words were out of your mouth ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù    You don‚Äôt care.     You don‚Äôt care?    (You cared.)    Mithrun‚Äôs lips parted and his brows slightly furrowed. He knew what it was like to not care. He had to know you were lying. Yet the words wrapped around him and sunk into his veins like poison. Immediately they spread through his body. For someone who cared about so little he despised how you apparently did not care.     Which in and of itself was a desire. He felt something. He stared at you as if you‚Äôd just kicked a puppy and you knew in that moment that he desired‚Äî even if he didn‚Äôt realize it.     That was okay you decided within seconds. He didn‚Äôt need to realize it.     ‚ÄúDo you not realize‚Ä¶‚Äù slowly he lowered his body like an anchor dropping into water. His hands slid across the dirty stone then his forearms until he was only inches away from you. His breath mingled with yours and your abdomen pulled again. It was as if his proximity had captured your soul on a hook and it was all you could do to stay grounded. Mithrun continued ‚ÄúThat if you died‚Äì‚Äù    The line began to stretch.     His fingers wrapped around your throat. Your heart flipped rather gracelessly. His fingers were cold and firm and in the perfect spot encompassing your pulse. He could most likely feel the increase of your heart rate beneath the pads of his index fingers but that was fine. He knew.     It was nothing new. Yet you‚Äôd seen flowers bloom a thousand times. You‚Äôd seen the oranges and pinks of the sunset a thousand times. But you always stopped for them giving them a moment of your life. Who could possibly say they were tired of seeing the sunset?     ‚ÄúDo you not understand what that would do?‚Äù He asked. Mithrun‚Äôs voice was quieter than usual‚Äî he wasn‚Äôt trying to seduce you he was trying to talk to you. For half of a second you felt like a total pervert for melting beneath his touch.     Yet pervert or not you wanted that line to stretch further.     ‚ÄúDo to who?‚Äù You asked despite the light pressure on your throat ‚ÄúWhat would it do? Why do you even care?‚Äù    ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Äù was his immediate answer. He had his hand around your throat and looked at you as if you‚Äôd ruined his life. Such vitriol such hatred. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt.‚Äù    You began to thrive. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being contradictory.‚Äù    ‚ÄúStop.‚Äù    You immediately stopped thriving. ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù    There were certain lines you wouldn‚Äôt cross. Perhaps it was best to leave this particular one alone.     But he kept his fingers around your throat.     Mithrun‚Äôs expression turned slightly softer though it was just a hint gathered from the shape of the lines between his brows and the slight flutter of his left eye. You could‚Äôve written a book on the slight facial expressions of the ex-Dungeon Lord of the Central Observation Tower.     ‚ÄúPromise you won‚Äôt do that again.‚Äù It was technically a question but Mithrun wasn‚Äôt asking. The Captain was commanding.     And as one-track minded and stubborn as you were you were his. You tried your best to respect his set lines.     However ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try my best‚Äù was all you could offer him.     Mithrun‚Äôs shoulders lowered though not because he relaxed. His body arched ever so slightly as he pushed down further on your windpipe‚Äî there it was again that pull that ache that burning. Consuming. What had you even done in the first place?    He noticed because he always noticed. He simply didn‚Äôt usually acknowledge it. His eye widened and searched your face as heat rose to your cheeks. You tilted your head back to give his hand more room. Grabbing people by the neck using his teleportation magic to remove their heads from their bodies and replace them with stone was natural for him. And touching you that was natural too.     Yet this was one of those fine lines. As he exhaled softly and his fingers tightened digging into your skin your eyes fluttered. The line had been stretched again. Your muscles tensed and you couldn‚Äôt help but lift your hips. Through the layers of clothes the room between your bodies closed and your flames brushed against him. Again Mithrun exhaled sharper. His head slightly dipped and his brows furrowed and his hair fell into his face.     You knew.     He slid lower until your breaths intermingled. You closed your eyes as his lips brushed against yours. It was like holding a monster back by a thin weak leash. In seconds it would snap. Rampage.    With a slight lift of your hips against his it snapped. You could practically hear the sharp crack of thread breaking away. The taut bowstring of his body released as he pressed his lips against yours. They slotted together. His teeth scraped harshly against your bottom lip and you gasped into his mouth but he didn‚Äôt care. He never cared. He continued holding himself up by core strength alone as his free hand went to your waist as if he wanted to pin you down to the cold stone floor.     You tilted your head so your noses wouldn‚Äôt bump. His breath drifted into your mouth; it was hot but smelled like nothing. Mithrun slowed down for half a second to gently pull at your lip with his teeth and it was as if he had pulled the rubber in your stomach too tightly and it was snapping back with a force that wracked your body. The shiver was undeniable. His fingers on your hips dug in even tighter; he clearly wanted to pierce your skin and feel your flesh encircle him. Fingers were important they were the parts of the body that controlled things that reacted that felt. He held you as if he desperately wanted to feel.     It hurt.     It would leave bruises round representing four fingers on your hips.    The pain spread through you like a drop of dye in water. It branched out reached out ran out. It stretched to the edges and corrupted every inch of your body until you were colored Mithrun.     That was the line. It wanted to do more than simply bend.     One tendril loosened and pulled away. The frayed edges were happy to be free to feel the air.     You raised your arms and wrapped them around his neck yanking him down even closer. If it was possible to put a negative amount of centimeters between you both you‚Äôd find some way to achieve it. In past relationships kissing was a constant reminder to pucker then deepen then hold. With Mithrun you didn‚Äôt think you couldn‚Äôt think. It was as if he‚Äôd breathed something into you that scrambled your brain.     And his hand was still around your neck.     And his hand tightened.     And you let out a soft noise without deciding to do so. His left eye lowered slightly as he pulled back to look at you‚Äî admire you? Perhaps. It might not have been pure delusion on your part.     Another tendril of the line frayed and threatened to snap. Your abdomen pulsed. After meeting Mithrun you started to believe that desire was a concept. After kissing Mithrun you knew that desire was an emotion a pulsating and raw and consuming emotion that liked to wrap its cold hands around your entire body around your throat. Merciless. Ruthless. Apathetic to what was logical and right because desire had its goal in mind and would do anything to reach it.     He squeezed. You gasped. Something thrummed threatening to break out of your skin.     And the fine line snapped. Pleasure mingled with its enemy: pain. Mithrun crashed his lips against yours again and you softly moaned into his mouth helpless to his touch. For once he put in the work. For once he was motivated. For once he wanted.    It wouldn‚Äôt last you knew. Your rightful spot in the race was clearly second a silver medal.     Yet for the moment with the way he touched you as if he could kill you for daring to leave him‚Ä¶    With the way he squeezed with the way he bit with the way he exhaled as if letting out years of stress‚Äî    Your lines intersected and for once he was yours.,2024-07-11 03:14:04 GMT

This post is for fan entertainment I‚Äôm not being paid.  This volume is thicc! Dungeon Meshi Thursday!!!!!!  Ok there is a lot of tension between Chilchuck and Izutsumi I am hoping in the future they will get along better but for now I can see them butting heads more. But during the fight with the Ice Golem they do know how to put their differences aside and work together to get the job done.  At first I felt sorry for Izutsumi they wanted to be change back to their normal form. Also I was reading more in The Adventurer‚Äôs Bible understanding their back story a bit more and I was shocked on what I found out on the part of who placed the curse on Izutsumi. (I will do a separate post on The Adventurer‚Äôs Bible; I highly recommend the book.)  Izutsumi seems to have a hard life that leads to major trust issues and will only help if it benefits her and her goals. But she has the pallet of a child that refuses to try new things and will throw a fit if she doesn‚Äôt get what she wants.  It also makes me wonder what her life was when she was with Shuro‚Äôs group I mean we do see Izutsumi and the other ladies interact and it does seem that Izutsumi pushes stuff she doesn‚Äôt want to do/want on too Tade (even though when Tade fell off the roof no one asked her to go up and do that chore she just wanted to be useful.)  Now some of the middle chapters I am now greatly worried about the group The Canaries. This group seems to have an impressive resume that even Kabru knows and has deeply affected him.  This whole group is elves and from previous volumes they are looking for the secret of eternal life. That it seems that elves take over dungeons when they get out of hand and from what Tansu has said that the elves want this dungeon back.  When I got the village part of the volume I was surprised to see how a village managed to survive in this dungeon for so long. (I know that it‚Äôs Sissel magic that is keeping them alive.) But I pity them when they just farm to farm and do not really enjoy the product of their work. Like their sense of taste is so dull and with magic they have no reason to eat.  (Good lord if I couldn‚Äôt taste food I would be devastated I love food and seeing something that you love like sushi or pizza and not being able to taste the cheese sauce and crust and spices I would be beyond depressed.)  With that aside these chapters we got a lot of information about Sissel how he came to Degal kingdom how he got into magic. How dedicated he is to try to find King Degal.  When Laois‚Äôs group got into the village we meet Yaad the grandson of King Degal and he is ruling the village they are in currently. Ever since Degal left for the surface there has been a rift between the surviving Degal family and Sissel.  Yaad explains a prophecy about a person with a winged sword who would come and stop the mad mage and become the ruler of the dungeon. However they need the help of a winged lion (that is their god that Degal‚Äôs people worshipped). But Sissel has it locked away in the lower levels of the dungeon.  So Laois has a choice to make.  At end of this chapter after Yaad helps the group leave we see Sissel asking in a very scary way who was Yaad talking too.  This part makes me worried for Yaad.  The last chapters of the book‚Ä¶. *cue hysterical crying* POOOR SENSHI!!!!!!!!!!!! *uncontrollable sobbing* Oh lord his back story!!! His fear!!!! My god this must have tortured him for so long!!!!  You never see Senshi cry!!!!  Now (*Dries tears*) I do have some conflicted feelings with Laois in this chapter.  I can see where he is coming from (and maybe its just me being overprotective of Senshi) but when discussing the death of Senshi‚Äôs old group I do wish both Chilchuck and Laois exercised some tact like talking in private out of ear shot of Senshi.  Laois is thinking is hard to follow sometimes let‚Äôs eat the griffin and see if it tasted like the one from your past if does yay you didn‚Äôt eat your teammates or oh no this doesn‚Äôt taste like that meal so that means I ate a team-mate.  However I did like what Chilchuck said to Laois that he really needs to stop. This was what I was talking about in my last post with Shuro and communication skills.  Chilchuck has good communication skills he will not hesitate to call Laois on things that are delicate.  Though when re-reading the chapter again I am glad that Senshi had such a great teammate to put Senshi who was at the time the youngest in the group.   DON‚ÄôT MAKE SENSHI CRY!!!!!!! My poor heart can‚Äôt take it!!!!!!!!,2024-07-11 15:14:34 GMT

You never see Senshi cry!!!!  Now (*Dries tears*) I do have some conflicted feelings with Laois in this chapter.  I can see where he is coming from (and maybe its just me being overprotective of Senshi) but when discussing the death of Senshi‚Äôs old group I do wish both Chilchuck and Laois exercised some tact like talking in private out of ear shot of Senshi.  Laois is thinking is hard to follow sometimes let‚Äôs eat the griffin and see if it tasted like the one from your past if does yay you didn‚Äôt eat your teammates or oh no this doesn‚Äôt taste like that meal so that means I ate a team-mate.  However I did like what Chilchuck said to Laois that he really needs to stop. This was what I was talking about in my last post with Shuro and communication skills.  Chilchuck has good communication skills he will not hesitate to call Laois on things that are delicate.  Though when re-reading the chapter again I am glad that Senshi had such a great teammate to put Senshi who was at the time the youngest in the group.   DON‚ÄôT MAKE SENSHI CRY!!!!!!! My poor heart can‚Äôt take it!!!!!!!!,2024-07-11 15:14:34 GMT

62,Dungeon Meshi,['delicious in dungeon'  'farcille'  'marcille donato'  'falin touden'  'my writing'],dani-in-the-daniverse,Little Farcille drabble Falin‚Äôs lips moved but the sound of her voice was muffled as if she was underwater. Marcille still smiled though. She could look at her wife for hours even though she couldn‚Äôt understand what she was saying. She took a sip of the tea Senshi had prepared for them earlier. It tasted a bit metallic but she paid it no mind. Falin had stopped talking and was now looking out the window seemingly lost in thought. Marcille followed but instead of the outside world she was faced with their reflections as if they were looking into a mirror rather than their kitchen window.   She had always thought it was impossible to look at your own reflection in a dream because our brains don‚Äôt really know what we look like. But somehow she knew the person in the reflection was herself. As for Falin‚Ä¶ was that Falin?   An old woman was sitting in front of her.   ‚Ä¶She woke up out of breath like a heavy weight sat on her chest.   Falin moved beside her seemingly awake as well.   ‚ÄúMarcille?‚Äù  ‚ÄúFalin!‚Äù She sobbed ‚ÄúFalin Falin‚Ä¶‚Äù  She let her wife hold her as she cried. Falin let her fingers card through Marcille‚Äôs hair gingerly like she was afraid.   ‚ÄúWhat happened love?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ you were there but‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt you.‚Äù   Falin kissed her teary eyes.   ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI was still the same but‚Ä¶ you weren‚Äôt.‚Äù  Falin understood. She held Marcille tightly as she cried not worrying about her pajama shirt getting dirty with snot and tears.   ‚ÄúHow bad was it?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNot too bad‚Äù they were still together after all. But that was what scared Marcille being still the same as Falin aged. ‚ÄúYou were with me but‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúI know. I know.‚Äù  Marcille cried harder gripping Falin‚Äôs shirt like a lifeline. There were so many conflicting feelings inside her mind a turmoil that she couldn‚Äôt tame.   ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ and Laios Chilchuck Senshi and Izutsumi‚Ä¶ Sometimes I think it would be easier if I hadn‚Äôt met you if I hadn‚Äôt loved you. How can I be alone again after loving all of you and being loved in return?‚Äù  Falin tightened her hold.   ‚ÄúWould you be happier if you hadn‚Äôt met us?‚Äù  No. Of course not. Only after having met Falin and the others had she realized that it was so easy to be happy. She had always been alone and now she wasn‚Äôt but there was always that bittersweet feeling that everything was fleeting.   ‚ÄúI know I can‚Äôt ease your fear I accept that. But Marcille that‚Äôs just the future. If you let your fear of the future consume you you won‚Äôt be able to cherish the present. And I want to share my present with you. I want to make as many memories as I can do everything I want to do so when I have to leave this world you can be assured that I‚Äôm leaving happy and without regrets.‚Äù  Marcille sobbed into her wife‚Äôs chest.   ‚ÄúFalin‚Ä¶ why do you have to say those things? You tell me I shouldn‚Äôt worry about the future and yet‚Äî‚Äú  ‚ÄúI never said you shouldn‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôm just saying that having a short life doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be lived to the fullest. My life is wonderful: I‚Äôm married to the person I‚Äôve loved since I was a child I have my brother and a lot of amazing friends and we do so much fun stuff together. If I can keep living like this even if it‚Äôs not for long it‚Äôll be worth it. Life however short is worth it. And I-we are all happy to share it with you.‚Äù  Marcille cried harder in her wife‚Äôs arms but there was a hint of relief this time.,2024-07-11 17:23:33 GMT

I say tutorial loosely cause I didn‚Äôt take any progress photos‚Ä¶but hopefully some of this helps someone!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; I received a couple messages on instagram about this cosplay so I thought it‚Äôd be easier to make a post about it! here‚Äôs a little rundown for anybody who needs it‚Ä¶!   I only had a week to make this costume so there isn‚Äôt a ton of actual sewing involved! (I got most of the materials in advance)  the main part‚Äôs essentially just a big quilt - I used a faux suede fabric (which was a little stretchy I really don‚Äôt recommend this but it was the best colour match I could find with my time limit! I think it would‚Äôve come out a lot smoother using something without stretch!) I used 2 ounce wadding/batting! the process is just measuring a bunch of rectangles using stick and spray to glue the wadding between the two fabrics and then sewing along all the lines. time consuming but it‚Äôs not hard!  I cut the quilt I‚Äôd made into two rectangles essentially you have two blankets - then I measured the neck and armholes based on a tank style dress I owned. if you‚Äôre a little unsure about this you can make a mockup first before cutting the real thing! then I sewed the shoulders together now it‚Äôs just one long blanket with a head hole!   I ended up trimming the sides of the front half before the next bit to help it conform to my body a little better but I had to wear it backwards on the day for reasons I‚Äôll explain in a minute T__T  next I sew bias tape down the sides and around the neck hole I folded the bottom ends and sewed them by hand to hide the stitches. you could probably just use bias around the whole thing but I was low on materials!  the buckles at the sides are literally just watch straps. the original listing I bought from‚Äôs gone now but I‚Äôm pretty sure these are the exact same thing. I bought 16mm and trimmed the ends a little I attached them using gorilla superglue!   the gloves are these gloves with the fingers cut off any brown leather gauntlet style glove will do and the scarf‚Äôs one I found on vinted. it was a long scarf originally I zigzag stitched down where I wanted it to end cut it then sewed the two ends together. the stitching‚Äôs a little wonky but you can‚Äôt really tell when it‚Äôs folded over!  the belt‚Äôs from amazon and the pouch is this one from aliexpress - I already had one of these for casual wear it‚Äôs a little foraging bag! it folds out into a bigger pouch!  I didn‚Äôt take photos but the shirt‚Äôs just one I found on vinted and the jeans are topshop joni jeans I‚Äôm pretty sure! the boots are just a pair I found secondhand and hot glued a strip of pleather to!  my wig is this one in chestnut brown I always use coscraft for wigs they‚Äôre my favourite! I trimmed it a little shorter and used thinning scissors over the whole wig!  last but not least is the ears. I almost didn‚Äôt use these and I‚Äôm so glad I did! I felt so silly and cute wearing them! I used these ears but searching ‚Äúprosthetic big ears‚Äù should come up with others if you do a little digging! I don‚Äôt have any experience with prosthetics aside from a pair of hobbit ears I wore a few years back for halloween but they‚Äôre not too tricky to apply.  I trimmed the edges down a little and applied my foundation to them powdered them to seal it and then added a little blush to the tips. I used ben nye prosthetic adhesive to glue them on! glue on my ears and onto the prosthetic ears let it get tacky then just held them in place until they stuck.   be careful with the adhesive when you‚Äôre applying it because my sibling accidentally spilled it down my costume‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why I ended up wearing it backwards on the day‚Ä¶  I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear with them on but it‚Äôs not too bad! cons are loud anyway and I‚Äôm autistic so the slight noise cancelling effect wasn‚Äôt bad at all!  another piece of advice I‚Äôd give is to buy one of these style neck fans you can buy them on amazon! I wore this during the day underneath my scarf and it helped a lot!,2024-07-11 17:02:14 GMT

Chilchuck has a grudge against Mimics for killing him so many times Marcille is wary of slimes Laios wanted to defeat the armors that defeated him.  Sometimes outfits that squeeze tight around the middle feel too much like the bite of dragons teeth. Hot humidity is too much like the inside of a mouth of a stomach.  But that was only one death. Another was outside the mad mage‚Äôs house.  She can‚Äôt eat curry anymore without feeling sick. Laios and Marcille make some excuse to the kitchens when she takes one bite and has to leave the table and the kitchens don‚Äôt serve curry anymore. Falin doesn‚Äôt drink alcohol anymore the hazy sleepy buzz leaving her disoriented and panicky.   Marcille sneaks up behind her one day and covers her eyes a playful game of guess who. Falin spends the next half hour apologizing for the deep scratches in Marcille‚Äôs arms even after they‚Äôve been magically healed unable to fully explain the desperate fighting response that had come over her.  Laios is playing with his napkin after a meal as he talks. Falin loves her brother‚Äôs fidgets his active hands but when they pull the fabric taut she has some cold wave of dread and it‚Äôs suddenly very hard to breathe.   It‚Äôs not always. It‚Äôs not everything. She lives a full life a happy life with her brother and her friends. That death happened when she was mostly dragon and the dragon is mostly gone now. But part of her remembers.,2024-07-11 19:41:54 GMT

Tension between Kabru and Reader since Kabru has his biases but tries not to let them show). Anyways they run into sex pollen. reader is a monster (sentient n can speak) and kabru stumbles on their lair. They‚Äôre either in heat/rut and the pheromones set Kabru off. Before he knows it he‚Äôs hard and fucking reader (he‚Äôll be more apprehensive and it‚Äôll be pretty dubcon maybe)vote on the premise  reader is a beastkin/monster hired to help Kabru + team navigate dungeon  reader is a monster (sentient n can speak) and kabru stumbles on their lair  See Results SECOND THING: READERS GENITALS. Sorry but. They aren‚Äôt gonna have a regular pussy. They will have monster pussy which features a hole that goes crazy and is wet asf and has some checmical agent that keeps Kabru hard but makes him cum a lot.  Reader will also have a clit that functions as a dick. And yes. Reader will fuck Kabru with it.  how do we feel about this nyall??? We good???,2024-07-11 19:14:57 GMT

6,Dungeon Meshi,["don't starve together"  "don't starve"  'delicious in dungeon'],kitsunaluna,funny how my two favorite pieces of media involve the concept of ‚Äúeven the most basic of idiots don‚Äôt starve‚Äù those being Don‚Äôt Starve and Dungeon Meshi. Both also involve the concept of ‚Äútheres no picky eating when in a life or death situation‚Äù.  Yes I know Ryoko Kui herself said shes a picky eater but thats not the point. The point being if you are in a place where you either eat or starve you always will pick eat. Its why cannibalism happens when theres nothing else. No on is a non-cannibal when they are on the brink of dying of hunger.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; So before anyone goes pointing fingers at me saying im not a picky eater. I am. I don‚Äôt like calling myself it since I have a wide diet. But I am. I flat out refuse to eat anything related to onions fish (catfish being the sole exception) and a lot of veggies. If i find a burger has pickles on it i legit cant eat it. Tasting pickles or onion ruins my appetite completely i flat out stop eating and throw whatever it was away or give it to someone else. Fish drives me up the wall truthfully and I dont know why; catfish has to be fried or else its the same as all other fish. I‚Äôll eat fish but not be happy about it. I‚Äôm picky about what color my rice is it has to be plain white or else needs to be fried rice. Olives squash and many more veggies and fruits are a heavy no go for me. Hell I can‚Äôt even bring myself to eat Poundcake or Banana Pudding unless im told its Yaya‚Äôs recipe despite the latter being techinally my favorite food. Banana pudding in a restaurant? Yeah no not gonna eat that for all the gold in Smaug‚Äôs horde. Thats stuff thats not even related to my many food allergies.  In Together theres several characters who have food blacklists Wigfrid is anything thats not meat Wurt is any meats Warly is food thats not a crockpot dish and will only eat it once every few days or suffer lessened returns till he flat out refuses to consume it and Wickerbottom can only eat food thats fresh as she has doubled penalties for stale or spoiled.   In Dungeon Meshi the party has no actual rations or regular food to consume. That is stated in chapter 1 and continues to persist the entire series. Slimes might be used as a food source in some areas but its not a widespread practice. Mandrakes are raised only to be used as magical herbs. Even then those are still seen as highly irregular and offputting. Marcille and Kabru arent picky eaters they flat our refusing to eat something labeled unclean by society at large. Holm‚Äôs religion forebids meat consumption a he mentions. Izutsumi declares she only wants to eat things she likes and is opposed to eating monters out of fear of becoming more of one; thats not in particular picky picky-eating since its framed as rebellion form authority a trait she developed living in Toshiro‚Äôs household as both unwanted pet and unwanted child.  What do our dungeon meshi characters have in common? They eat monster food out of necessity. A need for food and not a want to eat something unclean. A real world example is my friend who said ‚ÄúIf it came down to it allah would forgive me for eating something haram if i had no choice.‚Äù Marcille pitchs a fit over it till she accepts theres nothing else to eat and calms down. Kabru with the harpy eggs thinks of killing Laios to get out of that situation but eats it since killing him would have just made things unsavory.  Its established in chapter 2 you can‚Äôt just hop up and go to a tavern for a meal while in the dungeon. And the taverns in the dungeon itself are few and far between and service a shady and seedy clientele of active dangerous criminals. The Orcs chapter enforces it heavily that even if you want to trade its overly expensive in those dungeon tarverns.   Compared to everyone else Senshi is a survivor and is living off the land as best he can so he is used to hunting and gathering in the dungeon. As stated in the early chapters despite being more time costly hunting for food in the dungeon is the parties only way to go as even selling their gear and downgrading to cheaper items they wouldnt have enough for proper rations. Again its pointed out multiple times that them eating monsters is not normal despite how good it tastes its utterly abnormal.  NOW for The Constant food is more available. From meat to veggies eggs and fish. You can go out and trap a few rabbits or pick berries to eat your daily meal if you so chose. You can set up a farm and grow crops if you desired. Yet there too is a the issue of eating something out of NEED to eat something. As mentioned some of the survivors have food blacklists as in foods they can not consume outright or suffer penalties for consuming. Anything marked as a ‚ÄúGoodie‚Äù are on the table for everyone though.   Outside of the characters who have outright restrictions others have quotes for food items showing disinterest in it or not wanting to eat it. Monster Meat being the main one as its a toxic stringy overly fatty cut of meat that is mostly hair and sinew. Specificly ‚Äúbeard‚Äù hair if those dots are meant to connect. Either way even if someone doesnt like a food in the Constant they‚Äôll still eat it even if it actively hurts them just out of the raw need to eat anything.  Both media share a theme of survival over comfortability. You‚Äôll be uncomfortable in a situation where your choices are limited. Personal preference over food sometimes has to take a major backseat for the short term if it means getting to tomorrow.,2024-07-12 23:47:46 GMT

Saturday was pretty rough. I‚Äôd had a relatively easy time before then the crowds were overwhelming but I could stand them I never had to line up outside. Saturday was uhhh‚Ä¶yeah not like that. It was extremely hard to get in anything or get anywhere  But first! I got my autograph from Ryoko Kui! She was pretty and looked fairly young and wore her hair short. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm telling you this mostly just because it was interesting to put a face to a name. I basically told her that I loved her work and thank you and Marcille was one of my favorites in anything ever (she chuckled when I said that even before the guy translated so I guess she understood me) and for some reason I said I‚Äôd been reading for five years. It was such a blur that I can‚Äôt even remember her saying thank you (she probably did) I found myself wishing I‚Äôd actually asked some kind of interesting question like if she had any tips on creating such a complex world.  But we got a really cute little sticker to go with our autographs so I‚Äôm gonna show off here:  Since the autograph was at 11:00 AM (and I left it around 11:30) and the second Dunmeshi panel was 1:45 and the Barnes and Noble was a half hour away I had a feeling I wouldn‚Äôt get in and uh‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt. I really should have sent my Mom ahead of me since she offered but I felt bad at the idea of her having to sit through a ‚ÄòIs it okay to pick up girls in the Dungeon‚Äô or whatever panel before the Dunmeshi one. It was honestly just really unfair all around especially since the panel was in a smaller room this time for some reason with Blue Lock getting the ball room despite the fact I‚Äôm almost positive Dunmeshi is more popular. We did have to line up outside but at least I took pictures of some cosplayers.  I didn‚Äôt get into the Look Back panel either so I just went to the Crunchyroll Industry panel. If you weren‚Äôt in the front you couldn‚Äôt read the subtitles on the trailers so great planning there guys. Loooots of forgettable shonen but I did get to go crazy when they announced Natsume‚Äôs Book of Friends coming to crunchyroll (the other one I got to cheer for was Apothecary Diaries and Witch Hat again).

This post is specifically to answer my friend‚Äôs question regarding who Laios‚Äô Godly Parent is if he is a demigod. and my answer is Athena.   .  The reason is that Laios is a character who has intelligence and cleverness especially in making battle strategies.  .  all of Laios‚Äô friends believed in his intuition and tactics. and Laios also has quite extensive knowledge especially in matters of monsters which has turned into a strong obsession.   If most of Athena‚Äôs children are obsessed with things related to architecture science or art then Laios is actually obsessed with Monsters and this often makes him considered weird because usually Demigods hate monsters but Laios actually thinks Monsters are cool  .    and this also makes Athena as his mother also a bit depressed and often scolds Laios for his strange obsession,2024-07-13 02:45:00 GMT

This post is specifically to answer my friend‚Äôs question regarding who Laios‚Äô Godly Parent is if he is a demigod. and my answer is Athena.   .  The reason is that Laios is a character who has intelligence and cleverness especially in making battle strategies.  .  all of Laios‚Äô friends believed in his intuition and tactics. and Laios also has quite extensive knowledge especially in matters of monsters which has turned into a strong obsession.   If most of Athena‚Äôs children are obsessed with things related to architecture science or art then Laios is actually obsessed with Monsters and this often makes him considered weird because usually Demigods hate monsters but Laios actually thinks Monsters are cool  .    and this also makes Athena as his mother also a bit depressed and often scolds Laios for his strange obsession,2024-07-13 02:45:00 GMT

She wasn‚Äôt that much older - she still had a face that was round with residual baby fat. It gave her a deceptively soft appearance that was belied by her bright eyes.   Falin Touden hadn‚Äôt much left in common with the feral chimera Izutsumi had seen that day in the dungeon. Just the feathers‚Ä¶and the eyes. Bright reptilian eyes golden and predatorial.  A lot like Izutsumi‚Äôs own eyes.  Izutsumi skulked around the edges of her campsite watching her thinking.   Laios and Marcille thought the woman was an angel so that obviously didn‚Äôt mean very much.

801,Dungeon Meshi,['laios touden'],laikabu,i like artist laios but i think he has commissions open but primarily works in retail because he undercharges and people rarely commission him.  his sketches is pretty good but his lines/colors are mediocre and it turns people off. he‚Äôs atrocious at humanoid anatomy as well so he struggles getting the usual furry clients as feral artwork isn‚Äôt as in demand as humanoid ones.  his art is pretty good especially to a non-artist but if he submitted his portfolio to a studio he would get rejected(he doesn‚Äôt even bother to make a portfolio)  he has nightmares where his parents are telling him to get a real job,2024-07-13 09:29:32 GMT

Falin has always been protective of her brother and everyone/everything around her. She‚Äôs strong and powerful with magic. It‚Äôs pretty accurate that she would be an alpha from that. But also when Thistle transformed Falin into the Chimera she still had some of her personality and having that of an alpha it would be good to use for Thistle‚Äôs advantage.  Laios has always tried to be the man like what the village wants providing and caring for his sister but in a more fatherly way instead of a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm strong and in control‚Äù way. Laios being an omega while people like Chilchuck and Shiro are alphas would also make sense because of how both Shiro and Chilchuck repeatedly bash on Laios for not being as direct in situations like they are. I also think it would be interesting if Laios still posed as an alpha while trying to get a crew together so the crew doesn‚Äôt really understand why he acts certain ways that they don‚Äôt.,2024-07-14 02:01:48 GMT

So imagine you are a divorced father of three leader of a guild that you founded to keep your people from being exploited and just as you are reaching the age of ‚Äúgetting too old for this shit‚Äù a group shows up with a dangerous mission down to the lower depths of the dungeon and you sign on for one last job because no one else in the guild has the skill and experience required and even when things go sideways you stick around and continue to do your job like a professional and the entire time at least half the party is patting you on the head and treating you like a child.

Anyone who‚Äôs met him has something different but no less interesting to say.   ‚ÄúHe acts like an elf but he sure bargains like a half-foot.‚Äù ‚ÄúHis eyes are so weird and piercing‚Äì I swear they‚Äôre magic-altered!‚Äù ‚ÄúHe wears bells all over him like an odd jester but heaven knows he doesn‚Äôt act like one.‚Äù   The man is known for running with the oddball outcast party 90% of the time now‚Äì not a party you want to get on the bad side of if rumors are to be believed. They‚Äôre freaks but they‚Äôre dangerous and protective of their own.   Flauto himself is a man who has no direction‚Äì barely can be called a man really. Only one year above maturity and yet with the weight of a lifetime‚Äôs troubles on his shoulders he finds his only anchor with music and his best friend Ginger a fellow half-foot in his party.   His party holds him in high regard and affection as a leader strategist and mage. They trust his judgement and skill enough to defer to him in any combat situation.   He uses music and sound along with math and calculation to do what he does. He explores and understands the world around him in the context of sound and how it interacts with the environment. He uses small but effective spells that create sound at hyper-specific pitches and amplitudes setting them as alarms or even drones allowing him to be aware of almost an entire dungeon floor at once with very little mana used.   Although a powerful and respected mage and adventurer Flauto is rather soft-spoken and non-emotive. He can come off as hoity-toity or rude and dismissive to people who don‚Äôt know him well but he‚Äôs a very kind soul at heart. He is well-acquainted with the half-foot union and half his party members chose to join from rough circumstances only because of Flauto‚Äôs steady determination and heart.   History  Flauto wasn‚Äôt always an explorer- before everything he was a small strongly loved half-foot toddler. Unfortunately his natural aptitude for magic attracted attention from unwanted sources. At barely a year old he was kidnapped by 2 trainees for the research division of the Canaries‚Äì and to his parents it only seemed that he disappeared.   Flauto spent 11 years of his life in the labs of the elves experimented on and manipulated and poked and prodded. At one point they stole his face just to see what he would do. They gave it back after a month but then they took his arm.   He never got that one back.   He was trained in combat and magic if you could call it training. It was more training in the way you would say you trained a dog rough and dehumanizing and based in harsh conditioning. He figured out what he could from what he was given thrown into puzzles like a lab rat.   He escaped when he was 12 with barely a thing to his name other than the lab uniform on his back and the staff he‚Äôd grown himself beneath the elves‚Äô noses.   He stowed away in the first ship he found leaving the western continent and never looked back.   Of course an amateur teen half-foot with a big stick tattoos a missing arm and an elven army uniform is going to be noticed by the ship‚Äôs men. They corner Flauto more confused than angry but a cornered animal is going to strike so they get an earful of terrible noise for their troubles. Flauto is weak and worn out though so it isn‚Äôt very powerful and he‚Äôs (gently) taken to the captain‚Äì a kind half-elf half-foot.   Flauto is allowed to stay and provided with food and a place to sleep without question. He grapples with the realization that he is not the only one who‚Äôs survived and escaped hell.   When the ship reaches the island Flauto is let off peacefully and left to his own devices. Of which he has none.   It‚Äôs only luck that has him finding a shed to sleep in for the night‚Äì but he is discovered in the morning by the owners of the shed.   An elderly half-foot couple named Timturn and Morndoll upon discovering the terrified child in their shed decide that there is no better option than to take the child in and raise him the rest of the way like their own. And so Flauto gets 2 relatively peaceful years of healing and growing in an environment that cares.   And then because time comes for us all Timturn and Morndoll pass away of old age in the same night. They‚Äôve left a lot to Flauto but the house is not part of that understandably so Flauto leaves.   Once again he‚Äôs lost completely and now he‚Äôs grieving the loss of the only parental figures he ever knew.   What better way to lose himself and figure out who he is on this island than to throw himself into the dungeons?   And as it turns out dungeon life was practically made for him. His skills all gain power and relevance in the enclosed environments of the dungeon and his instincts make him highly useful. He starts to work for pay seeking out the island‚Äôs half-foot union.   And then by pure chance he meets Ginger.   Storyline Ginger is the one who chooses Flauto really but Flauto finds that he wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere but with her quite quickly.   A young half-foot seeking money to support her three younger sisters at home Ginger specializes in tools repair and invention inside the dungeon. The skilled way she uses her tools draws Flauto in and then her unconditional friendship teasing and support have him permanently hooked.   The deal is as sealed as a contract with the devil when Ginger shows Flauto the prosthetic she created for him. Up until that point Flauto had been tackling dungeons one-armed not seeing the need for extra weight. But Ginger‚Äôs prosthetic made life easier‚Äì and added new ways for him to use sound and wield his staff.   They team up now a package deal for any job. But then their ‚Äòpackage deal‚Äô expands by one small beastkin girl and then a tallman fighter and another half-foot and an elf‚Äì  And before Flauto realizes it he‚Äôs amassed an entire party of his own skilled adventurers choosing to trust him and follow his lead.   That‚Äôs when unfortunately fate conspires and Ginger is eaten by a red dragon.   Flauto isn‚Äôt willing to accept that though. He doesn‚Äôt hesitate to trail the dragon until he has a good enough plan to take it down. He sends his party back to the surface. Of course they aren‚Äôt having any of it not willing to lose their leader and friend and the tallman drags him practically kicking and screaming to the surface.   It‚Äôs clear: ‚ÄúFlauto we will find Ginger but we can‚Äôt lose you in the process. You need to recover.‚Äù   Flauto doesn‚Äôt believe it. It isn‚Äôt fair. He‚Äôs lost what he thought he had twice now and in less than 2 years. It isn‚Äôt fair it can‚Äôt be it‚Äôs not fair! For the first time in his life Flauto finds himself breaking almost completely under the weight of his own emotions.   It should have been him‚Äì it will be him. He‚Äôll make sure of it.   He thinks that but well‚Ä¶ he can‚Äôt actually escape the watchful eyes of his friends.   They do head back down to the dungeon a week later once Flauto and the rest of the party are in better physical condition.   When they reach the red dragon on a level it never should have been on Flauto and the party watch quietly as another party excavate ginger‚Äôs remains along with another girl‚Äôs from the stomach of the dragon.   And then the elf-girl uses what looks like ancient magic to completely revive both of them.   Flauto is quick enough to escape any of the friends who would have tried to pull him back as he sprints towards the blood-soaked body of his partner unable to stop the tears that are running down his cheeks as he skids to a stop on his knees ignoring the party that was already there to grab Ginger‚Äôs arm then feel her pulse with his good hand. It‚Äôs there. She‚Äôs alive.   There‚Äôs someone else there helping Ginger cough up the blood in her airway and lungs Flauto vaguely registers but it‚Äôs over soon and she breathes in then looks at Flauto as she breathes out.   Flauto embraces her tighter than he thinks he ever has anyone begging her not to do that again.   And then that night after the two parties eat together of the meal Senshi of Izganda had prepared from the dragon Ginger wakes up. She follows Farlyn.   Flauto follows close behind.  And is too late to stop the mad mage from transforming both Ginger and Farlyn into full-on chimeras.   He doesn‚Äôt remember a lot of what happens after that.   By the time he‚Äôs back in his own body Sureau and Kabru‚Äôs parties have already arrived and left and his friends inform him that they have no idea where Ginger went.   So they make it their mission to find her.   (and that‚Äôs all i can give away without spoilers hehe)  Extras Here is some extra art of him:  (flauto during his own party‚Äôs run-in with the changeling mushrooms)  (flauto and chimera!ginger)  Small Fun Facts:  Flauto‚Äôs musical tattoos on his left arm are magic-enhancing! He is transmasc! His full half-foot name is Flauton Chils but he doesn‚Äôt know that yet.  He fully believes alto clef to be the superior music clef to read in.  He is an instrument expert by necessity‚Äì could tell you anything you wanted to know about the art of making and repairing bells chimes and similar instruments.  Yes Ginger is his girlfriend they are t4t they love each other very much,2024-07-14 17:49:51 GMT

Anyone who‚Äôs met him has something different but no less interesting to say.   ‚ÄúHe acts like an elf but he sure bargains like a half-foot.‚Äù ‚ÄúHis eyes are so weird and piercing‚Äì I swear they‚Äôre magic-altered!‚Äù ‚ÄúHe wears bells all over him like an odd jester but heaven knows he doesn‚Äôt act like one.‚Äù   The man is known for running with the oddball outcast party 90% of the time now‚Äì not a party you want to get on the bad side of if rumors are to be believed. They‚Äôre freaks but they‚Äôre dangerous and protective of their own.   Flauto himself is a man who has no direction‚Äì barely can be called a man really. Only one year above maturity and yet with the weight of a lifetime‚Äôs troubles on his shoulders he finds his only anchor with music and his best friend Ginger a fellow half-foot in his party.   His party holds him in high regard and affection as a leader strategist and mage. They trust his judgement and skill enough to defer to him in any combat situation.   He uses music and sound along with math and calculation to do what he does. He explores and understands the world around him in the context of sound and how it interacts with the environment. He uses small but effective spells that create sound at hyper-specific pitches and amplitudes setting them as alarms or even drones allowing him to be aware of almost an entire dungeon floor at once with very little mana used.   Although a powerful and respected mage and adventurer Flauto is rather soft-spoken and non-emotive. He can come off as hoity-toity or rude and dismissive to people who don‚Äôt know him well but he‚Äôs a very kind soul at heart. He is well-acquainted with the half-foot union and half his party members chose to join from rough circumstances only because of Flauto‚Äôs steady determination and heart.   History  Flauto wasn‚Äôt always an explorer- before everything he was a small strongly loved half-foot toddler. Unfortunately his natural aptitude for magic attracted attention from unwanted sources. At barely a year old he was kidnapped by 2 trainees for the research division of the Canaries‚Äì and to his parents it only seemed that he disappeared.   Flauto spent 11 years of his life in the labs of the elves experimented on and manipulated and poked and prodded. At one point they stole his face just to see what he would do. They gave it back after a month but then they took his arm.   He never got that one back.   He was trained in combat and magic if you could call it training. It was more training in the way you would say you trained a dog rough and dehumanizing and based in harsh conditioning. He figured out what he could from what he was given thrown into puzzles like a lab rat.   He escaped when he was 12 with barely a thing to his name other than the lab uniform on his back and the staff he‚Äôd grown himself beneath the elves‚Äô noses.   He stowed away in the first ship he found leaving the western continent and never looked back.   Of course an amateur teen half-foot with a big stick tattoos a missing arm and an elven army uniform is going to be noticed by the ship‚Äôs men. They corner Flauto more confused than angry but a cornered animal is going to strike so they get an earful of terrible noise for their troubles. Flauto is weak and worn out though so it isn‚Äôt very powerful and he‚Äôs (gently) taken to the captain‚Äì a kind half-elf half-foot.   Flauto is allowed to stay and provided with food and a place to sleep without question. He grapples with the realization that he is not the only one who‚Äôs survived and escaped hell.   When the ship reaches the island Flauto is let off peacefully and left to his own devices. Of which he has none.   It‚Äôs only luck that has him finding a shed to sleep in for the night‚Äì but he is discovered in the morning by the owners of the shed.   An elderly half-foot couple named Timturn and Morndoll upon discovering the terrified child in their shed decide that there is no better option than to take the child in and raise him the rest of the way like their own. And so Flauto gets 2 relatively peaceful years of healing and growing in an environment that cares.   And then because time comes for us all Timturn and Morndoll pass away of old age in the same night. They‚Äôve left a lot to Flauto but the house is not part of that understandably so Flauto leaves.   Once again he‚Äôs lost completely and now he‚Äôs grieving the loss of the only parental figures he ever knew.   What better way to lose himself and figure out who he is on this island than to throw himself into the dungeons?   And as it turns out dungeon life was practically made for him. His skills all gain power and relevance in the enclosed environments of the dungeon and his instincts make him highly useful. He starts to work for pay seeking out the island‚Äôs half-foot union.   And then by pure chance he meets Ginger.   Storyline Ginger is the one who chooses Flauto really but Flauto finds that he wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere but with her quite quickly.   A young half-foot seeking money to support her three younger sisters at home Ginger specializes in tools repair and invention inside the dungeon. The skilled way she uses her tools draws Flauto in and then her unconditional friendship teasing and support have him permanently hooked.   The deal is as sealed as a contract with the devil when Ginger shows Flauto the prosthetic she created for him. Up until that point Flauto had been tackling dungeons one-armed not seeing the need for extra weight. But Ginger‚Äôs prosthetic made life easier‚Äì and added new ways for him to use sound and wield his staff.   They team up now a package deal for any job. But then their ‚Äòpackage deal‚Äô expands by one small beastkin girl and then a tallman fighter and another half-foot and an elf‚Äì  And before Flauto realizes it he‚Äôs amassed an entire party of his own skilled adventurers choosing to trust him and follow his lead.   That‚Äôs when unfortunately fate conspires and Ginger is eaten by a red dragon.   Flauto isn‚Äôt willing to accept that though. He doesn‚Äôt hesitate to trail the dragon until he has a good enough plan to take it down. He sends his party back to the surface. Of course they aren‚Äôt having any of it not willing to lose their leader and friend and the tallman drags him practically kicking and screaming to the surface.   It‚Äôs clear: ‚ÄúFlauto we will find Ginger but we can‚Äôt lose you in the process. You need to recover.‚Äù   Flauto doesn‚Äôt believe it. It isn‚Äôt fair. He‚Äôs lost what he thought he had twice now and in less than 2 years. It isn‚Äôt fair it can‚Äôt be it‚Äôs not fair! For the first time in his life Flauto finds himself breaking almost completely under the weight of his own emotions.   It should have been him‚Äì it will be him. He‚Äôll make sure of it.   He thinks that but well‚Ä¶ he can‚Äôt actually escape the watchful eyes of his friends.   They do head back down to the dungeon a week later once Flauto and the rest of the party are in better physical condition.   When they reach the red dragon on a level it never should have been on Flauto and the party watch quietly as another party excavate ginger‚Äôs remains along with another girl‚Äôs from the stomach of the dragon.   And then the elf-girl uses what looks like ancient magic to completely revive both of them.   Flauto is quick enough to escape any of the friends who would have tried to pull him back as he sprints towards the blood-soaked body of his partner unable to stop the tears that are running down his cheeks as he skids to a stop on his knees ignoring the party that was already there to grab Ginger‚Äôs arm then feel her pulse with his good hand. It‚Äôs there. She‚Äôs alive.   There‚Äôs someone else there helping Ginger cough up the blood in her airway and lungs Flauto vaguely registers but it‚Äôs over soon and she breathes in then looks at Flauto as she breathes out.   Flauto embraces her tighter than he thinks he ever has anyone begging her not to do that again.   And then that night after the two parties eat together of the meal Senshi of Izganda had prepared from the dragon Ginger wakes up. She follows Farlyn.   Flauto follows close behind.  And is too late to stop the mad mage from transforming both Ginger and Farlyn into full-on chimeras.   He doesn‚Äôt remember a lot of what happens after that.   By the time he‚Äôs back in his own body Sureau and Kabru‚Äôs parties have already arrived and left and his friends inform him that they have no idea where Ginger went.   So they make it their mission to find her.   (and that‚Äôs all i can give away without spoilers hehe)  Extras Here is some extra art of him:  (flauto during his own party‚Äôs run-in with the changeling mushrooms)  (flauto and chimera!ginger)  Small Fun Facts:  Flauto‚Äôs musical tattoos on his left arm are magic-enhancing! He is transmasc! His full half-foot name is Flauton Chils but he doesn‚Äôt know that yet.  He fully believes alto clef to be the superior music clef to read in.  He is an instrument expert by necessity‚Äì could tell you anything you wanted to know about the art of making and repairing bells chimes and similar instruments.  Yes Ginger is his girlfriend they are t4t they love each other very much,2024-07-14 17:49:51 GMT
