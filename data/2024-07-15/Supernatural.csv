5,Supernatural,['lucifer spn'  'sam winchester'  'season 13 really had me in a chokehold'  'i’m screaming'  'i’m crying'  'and i can’t stop'],wrenwinchester,I’m sorry I just can’t get over the fact that the show repeatedly showed Lucifer as an abuser specifically as Sam’s abuser. And simultaneously refused to acknowledge that Sam was a victim. I’m gonna puke. (And even after everything he still has a positive outlook. I’m screaming.) also Lucifer is a fucking bitch boy.   Jared did a great job showing Sam’s guilt and how a victim might blame themselves without being given the dialogue or storylines to express or explain it.   But god it irks me. And I’m so emotional about it.   (I know I last posted about my rewatch back in like April or March. But I stopped watching right before tombstone and just couldn’t bring myself to go any further because well Cas was alive and everyone was together. The idea of going further seeing more people’s deaths and reliving the pain and seeing more pain. And I considered just starting over. But also I love Jack and I was just having a rough go so continuing watching supernatural wasn’t high on my priorities. Also just the emotional ruin that this show often puts me in was a struggle. Anyway.),2024-07-07 20:36:22 GMT

36,Supernatural,['spn'  'gabriel spn'  'sabriel'  'sam winchester'],woundlingus,How do you look at someone as soul deep scarred as Sam and know you had a large hand in what happened to him? Especially now that you know intimately exactly how all of that would have happened to Sam because now it’s happened to you too. No one deserves that it was not just desserts. Gabriel lead Sam like a lamb to slaughter with the horseman ring idea knowing what would happen if they were successful regardless of his belief that it would never actually happen and the world would always end. Now they both know what that plan costs.   Gabriel wanted redemption Asmodeus puts that pretty plainly. Gabriel got his just desserts and he doesn’t want to play trickster anymore. For just a brief moment he and Castiel talk about a future where he owns up to his mistakes and goes home to make things right and while he doesn’t verbally agree the telling part is that he doesn’t say no. Gabriel wants to be better and it starts with the Winchesters.   And in the end he instead gets to watch Lucifer be everything he’s not. He watches Lucifer save everyone. Save Sam.   The violation of it all to be stripped of his only purpose here and watch the torturer tote around like the hero and impart this on Jack watch Sam force a smile and play tough like he isn’t still shuddering with the touch of Lucifer denying him autonomy to make him his plaything. Up until two weeks ago that was still Gabriel at the hands of Asmodeus.   He’s made to watch it because he’s not strong enough to do anything about it. He can’t save anyone he can’t save Sam he can’t even save himself.   I’d kill myself too.,2024-07-07 20:11:24 GMT

Thank you for taking the time to read my supernatural fanfic❤️ I recently started working on this fic and would appreciate any constructive criticism as well as tips for future writing.   I’m not sure what ship I want to have with my OC ( I have some ideas in mind) but for now we will start at an early age in her life and once she is older I will establish a ship then. Anyways enough ranting here is the teaser for my fanfiction❤️❤️   &lt;!-- more --&gt; It was a dark stormy night. Bobby Singer was spending it as he usually does drinking his mug of whiskey and following up on some lore about some monster for a hunter that had called him asking for more information for an upcoming hunt. The old house creaked faintly; the noise being caused by the strong winds the storm brought in. Sighing heavily Bobby closed the old weathered down book and finished his drink in one big gulp. He set down the mug on his desk and was heading towards his room finally deciding to end the night at 3 a.m.    BANG BANG BANG    The loud noise startled Bobby out of his tired mindset. The sudden noise emitting from the other side of the door made him quickly grab his gun. Slowly he made his way towards the white wooden door and cautiously unlocked it. Cocking his gun he swung the door open in a rapid motion and immediately took aim. Only there was no one waiting on the other side of the door. Confused but still on high alert Bobby cautiously stepped out from the warmth of his home and onto the cold rainy night. He looked out into the yard yet no one could be seen from his position. He lowered the gun once he felt ‘safe enough’ and stood outside for a few seconds. His ears perked up at the sound of gurgling and immediately he found the source of the noise. There by the steps of the porch was a small basket. Intrigued he slowly made his way towards it keeping in mind that it may be a trap no one was ever safe in the world of hunters. Once he made his way to the basket he was able to take a closer look at what was inside. A pink baby blanket and a purple stuffed bunny accompanied the small baby that was inside. Bobby immediately picked the basket up and hurriedly made his way inside his home making sure to lock the door behind him.    He set the basket on the couch in his living room and stared at it for what felt like an eternity. The sound of the baby crying snapped him out of it and he carefully took the baby out of the basket making sure she stayed wrapped in the soft pink blanket. The full head of hair was the first thing that caught his eye. The baby had the thickest black curls Bobby had ever seen; blacker than night they made the darkness the storm brought with it like daylight compared to them. He noticed that she had stopped crying how long ago he didn’t know.    The baby girl had the most beautiful eyes hazel with streaks of green and honey. She was staring at him so focused that Bobby thought she was looking into his soul. It creeped him out a bit if he was being honest. A toothless smile graced the baby’s chubby face gurgling at him and grabbing at his beard with her small pudgy hands. Bobby chuckled softly tears delicately decorating his eyes. So many emotions ran through his brain. He was confused who would abandon this baby on his front porch in the middle of a stormy night? He was happy maybe this was his sign from Karen after so many years that he could be the father that he deserved to be. He could give this baby girl a happy life nurture her and make her part of this messed up family. But the feeling of dread washed over him as he realized he was only visited by people he knew hunters. The life of hunting claimed yet another life; it didn’t matter that it hadn’t killed her. She would have to grow up knowing that this world—one she was brought into without asking for it to happen—was filled with terrifying creatures those that would kill mercilessly and without hesitation.    None of that mattered. It would raise questions if he took this baby somewhere else. And he didn’t even want to think about what would happen if a monster or anyone with a grudge against him used the baby as leverage once she was out of his sight. He decided there and then that there was a reason that the baby girl was left on his front porch. He didn’t believe in God the reality that he lived was proof enough that the bastard had left forever ago. But deep down he believed that this was an opportunity for him to redeem himself and to prove to his bastard dead father that he was good enough to raise something so innocent and delicate to provide and love them.    At that moment something caught the eye of Bobby. A white piece of paper that was crumpled and the closer he looked at it small spatters of blood were visible.,2024-07-07 21:34:17 GMT
57,Supernatural,['dean winchester'  'sam winchester'  'castiel'  'mary winchester'  'destiel'  'spn'],insomniacirl,Cas in season 12 episode 1 and 2 being so needlessly violent and overprotective of Dean in front of Mary mean so much to me you don’t understand.   Mary: That’s an angel?  She prayed for an angel to watch over her boys. She got her wish- she just didn’t expect the angel to draw her eldest into a hug so tight it seemed too intimate for her to understand the first time she met him. She just didn’t expect him to become so frustrated and violent after losing Sam something Dean tasked him with to begin with- and she also didn’t expect that just a word from Dean would pull all that violence from his eyes so fast.,2024-07-07 21:29:08 GMT
10,Supernatural,['spn'  'castiel'],lesbian-steppenwolf,one of my favourite things about cas is when we first meet him and we see him interacting with humans how we’re led to think uh maybe he’s so awkward cause he’s such a powerful being therefore to him earthly and lowly matters such as human social skills bear no significance at all. and then we meet other angels and we see him interacting with other angels and we come to the conclusion that he’s just autistic,2024-07-07 21:28:13 GMT

23,Supernatural,['season 4 dean “if he dies at least he dies human”'  'sam winchester'  'john winchester'],nobodymitskigabriel,Don’t know why we keep pressing the idea that John was in any way resentful toward Sam because of what happened to Mary. John always believed that Sam was a victim of his potential circumstances. He did not believe that Sam was secretly evil. He was hard on Sam because he genuinely believed it was the best way to protect him in an unsafe world and put him on the right path. He told Dean that he would have to save Sam or kill him not because he loved Sam any less than Dean but to save Sam from what he might become. John Winchester first principle is that he loved his sons more than anything in the world.,2024-07-07 21:25:08 GMT

The lights flashed obnoxiously blinding you every so often as you fought your way to the bar. Truthfully clubs had never been your scene. They were too hot loud and full of the worst people you’d ever meet.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; On any normal occasion you would have declined your friend’s offer but when she’d suggested a group of you go to the local club for her birthday you’d found yourself nodding along.  Five drinks later and while you were pleasantly buzzed the feel of bodies pressing against your own still left a nauseating pit in your stomach.   Reaching the bar almost felt like a breath of fresh air. The area was significantly less crammed and for the first time since you’d arrived you felt able to breathe. “Hey. You okay?” A hand pressed against your lower back.  Sam frowned slightly as he watched you lean over towards the bartender. You yelled something into his ear before pulling back. You turned to him with a smile. A slight flush covered your cheeks as your hand gripped his arm.  “M’good. Too much down there.” You gestured to the floor. Sam nodded his own distaste for the club forefront in his mind. “Glad it’s not just me.” He squeezed your hip stepping closer as the bartender returned with your drink.   Grabbing it himself he led you over towards a booth. You slipped in Sam following closely behind as he placed your drink on the table. The music continued to pulse as you lay your head against the cold black leather.  Sam sighed laying an arm over the back of the booth. He looked around the room for a moment his eyes catching on two of your friends seemingly wrapped up in each other. You mindlessly sipped at your drink picking at the edge of your skirt.  “They look like they’re having fun.” He murmured into your ear. You looked over a sly smile growing on your lips. “Took them long enough he’s been smitten since he first saw her.”  Sam laughed nodding in agreement.   You fell quiet again going back to your drink. The music seemed to fade slightly as the soft buzz of alcohol grew inside your head. Now you were out of the crowd your body seemed to relax enough for the alcohol to finally take effect.  Finishing your drink you pushed the glass away. His arm shifted down slightly now coming down to rest on your shoulder. His hand brushed your shoulder gently as he looked over to you.   You shifted slightly looking up to meet his gaze. Your heart jumped slightly as you noticed the fond look in his eyes. You held his gaze for a moment longer before breaking into a small fit of giggles the drink making you softer almost.  Sam smiled shaking his head slightly as your laughter died down. “Sorry.” You held up a hand. “You wanna go back?” His hand continued to rub over your shoulder as you took a breath. “Yeah. Yeah.”  Taking your hand you said your goodbyes before making your way back to the dorms. The night air sobered you up ever so slightly as you made mindless small talk. By the time you reached your dorm you’d tucked yourself into his side leaning on him as you both climbed the stairs.  Fumbling with your bag for a moment you pulled out your key before turning to him. His hand rested on your hip as you quietly whispered back and forth for a moment. The world seemed to blur for a moment before you leaned up your lips meeting his.  You shifted closer one of your hands moving to the nape of his neck.  You’d both danced this dance many times before. Every time you went out no matter the occasion you always seemed to end up in each other’s beds by the end of the night. “Is your roommate out?” He pulled back for a moment his lips brushing yours as you shook your head.   “She’s not gonna be back till tomorrow afternoon.” You barely gave him time to respond before you pressed your lips to his again.   “Good.” He licked into your mouth deepening the kiss as your back hit the door.  Reaching back you fiddled for a moment before the door fell open you both stumbling into the room. Sam kicked the door shut before trailing his lips along your jaw for a moment as the back of your knees hit the bed.  Falling back onto the bed he caged you in pulling back for a moment to trace your features with his eyes. He grinned - a boyish smile before his lips met yours again and you fell back into the haze of each other.,2024-07-07 21:24:04 GMT

For instance the Kate!ghoul in “Jump the Shark” mentioning that Sam’s blood taste’s different. Like Sam’s body already had some base contamination of demon blood from 6 months old and we know that would impact him based on the first 2 seasons of the show alone. And on top of that he’s been chugging down demon blood for at least the last few episodes so that’s got to have some impact on his blood like any other dietary choice.  But we’re not going to dig into that? I have to assume from how powerful demon blood is it’s not just a flavor thing. And it’s strong enough in Sam from what he’s been willingly ingesting they’d probably be impacted. So would it make the ghouls stronger? Or give them powers? Or adversely would it make them sick like food poisoning? Would it kill them? And by that matter what about other creatures? What would Sam’s blood do to a vampire? Or another human for that matter? Is Sam’s blood dangerous to other humans?   And instead - immediate headshot/Dean beating ghoul!Adam to death. No time to determine if it would have an impact and it’s never mentioned again. I haven’t been so frustrated since the Termites ate poor infected Bob’s leg and died via Rick and co. before any adverse effects appeared. Because it’d be an interesting twist alone if they were either made stronger or partially incapacitated by Sam’s blood to impact Dean’s fight with the ghouls (and imagine Sam and Dean dealing with the implications of that in the following episodes).  That said I would bet money this knowledge of the differences in his blood haunted Sam at some point. I can’t see him doing things like donating blood once he realized exactly what’s in his system.,2024-07-07 22:49:36 GMT

Okay so meet Sam Harrison. After the death of his mother when he was 9 and then his dad going missing he grew up in L.A. being raised by his uncle Tommy and his aunt Cherryl who are both very caring and supportive being the most perfect parents ever. He had a stable home a not so bad childhood he is the smarter in his school got a best friend a girlfriend (btw in this version I find Jessica very annoying) and STILL he gets to act all emo and complain about his life not being as perfect as people think it is bcz his mom randomly died in a car accident or something and he is livid at his dad for living him and Dean behind when the man was having a really hard time to cope with his wife death and people were just screaming at him and so bcz of that Sam thinks that his life is dark or something and like BRO. Go ask Sam Winchester what’s it’s like to grew up without a home friends or family with just having an absent father without loving uncle and aunt to take care of you to not being supported by your family and you’re gonna ask yourself if you’re life is still as awful as you think it is because I don’t think so.  So no one got any news of Dean since 2 yrs and somehow people are just being angry at him instead of worrying ?? Then Sam is being all grumpy bcz his brother that didn’t show any sign of life in the past 2 yrs didn’t randomly show up at his graduation. But then when he actually gets to show up (Dean got the same entry as a vilain it was so funny lmao 💀) Sam is being mad at Dean for being here and he wants him to leave ??   Dean actually feels bad for missing Sam graduation and not being here for 2 yrs but when he tries to apologize Sam swears to him that he is not mad at him when literally 2 hours ago he pouted at him for that exact reason.   Then Dean kidnaps Sam.  Sam thinks that Dean is crazy just like their dad used to be that he killed their dad and that now he wants to kill him and Dean is just like wtf no ?? I would never hurt you or dad ever.   And Sam is like yeah…I’m not very sure about that…  And Dean used to be a bully when he was younger 💀 aunt Cherryl and uncle whatever-his-name-is totally favorised Sam over Dean (you can’t convince me otherwise) Jessica always asks to be the center of attention and she didn’t reject Dean when he flirted with her in front of Sam.  Also I feel like they just switched the roles of Sam and Dean with Dean being the most emotional one who tries to talk and Sam being the one keeping his emotions in the inside and refuse to communicate. In the childhood flashback we can see 13 y/o Dean openly being scared and crying and 9 y/o Sam not showing any emotions.  If I had to resume this I would say that it’s an even worst version of the universe of 2x20.,2024-07-07 22:31:29 GMT

Reasons Dean didn’t talk about his possession by Michael when he came back in episode 3 of season 14  He was scared He was avoiding emotions He was trying to avoid his guilt (also why he told Sam that he didn’t remember things that happened while Michael was possessing him right away.)

Like why r we framing it like Sam wanted to leave Dean and didn’t care abt his family cuz he wanted a ‘new’ family. That’s just factually wrong???  Sam loved his family. He loved Dean. He worked hard to protect them and many times chose them over others. He did not “abandon” his family when he went to Stanford cuz he wanted a new family or “life” he did cuz he wanted to have a safe environment. Why is Sam blamed and framed as bad for wanting to escape an unsafe (and to a point abusive/neglectful) environment. He loved his dad and brother but he knew and was brave enough to get himself out of a harmful situation.  And legit besides Stanford I can’t think of a point where Sam truly abandoned his family. Like yea. When he thought Dean was DEAD he hitched up with a girl. And yea. Throughout the series Sam and Dean have their squabbles and break ups. But they 1) always come back together and 2) Dean sometimes is the one to leave Sam during their breakups it’s not all on Sam.  The photos OP chose to use for their “Sam wanted to move on blah blah” slide is literally Sam founding a new family after deans death. Like what was he suppose to do!! Kill himself?? Be a hermit cuz deans dead and it’s wrong for him to move on??? And. Also. Dean TOLD him to move on. Before he died he told Sam to 1) not to try to bring him back and 2) live a good life. Sam did not do anything wrong by fostering a healthy lifestyle for himself post dean’s death. ALSO he did not want to “move on”. In the time skip we literally see him being all sad in the impala cuz he misses his brother and wants him back. He didn’t choose to move on!! It was thrusted upon him!  Also how is Sam moving on after deans death in the finale any different than Dean living with Lisa when Sam was in the cage. Like. In both cases the one of them told the other that they wanted them to go live a happy normal life and in both cases they did just that and in both cases they didn’t entirely move on cuz they missed their brother.  It’s just. Such a bad take. I’m afraid media literacy is dead :(,2024-07-07 23:29:13 GMT

26,Supernatural,['dean winchester'  'spn'  'sam winchester'  'john winchester'  'jump the shark'  'spn 4x19'  'supernatural discourse'  'supernatural meta'],locke-esque-monster,There’s something to be said about the dynamic of Sam and Dean as Sam fully turns into a version of John. Because on the one hand Dean typically called the shots to a certain degree while working with Sam. Or at least they butted heads. While Dean nearly always followed John’s orders.  By the time we hit “Jump the Shark” you can see Dean is trying to call the shots and Sam is full rejecting them. Sam can’t pull a John and pull rank. But he’s blatantly ignoring what Dean wants to do and Dean has just caved to it like Sam’s training Adam. Or in previous episodes where they’re following leads from Ruby which Dean has seemed to resign himself to after the debacle with Anna. Dean’s not happy with it he’s arguing it a way he never would have with John but he’s tolerating Sam doing something he disagrees with in a way he never would have previously.   And while Dean taking Adam to Bobby would have been a mistake (but such a good AU fic concept I’d love to read) Sam is fully pulling a John using him as bait. Like John used to use Dean as bait as seen in “Dead Man’s Blood”.   Maybe it’s because Dean isn’t the same after hell and doesn’t have the desire to fight with Sam. Maybe it’s because Sam’s acting so like John and Dean instinctively doesn’t fight that energy from a lifetime of service under John or wouldn’t know how to if he wanted to. But it’s interesting that’s the dynamic that we have between these two before their split at the finale and the knowledge that Sam was very much in the wrong by season’s end (suggesting John was wrong to a certain degree too).,2024-07-07 23:19:34 GMT

For instance the Kate!ghoul in “Jump the Shark” mentioning that Sam’s blood taste’s different. Like Sam’s body already had some base contamination of demon blood from 6 months old and we know that would impact him based on the first 2 seasons of the show alone. And on top of that he’s been chugging down demon blood for at least the last few episodes so that’s got to have some impact on his blood like any other dietary choice.  But we’re not going to dig into that? I have to assume from how powerful demon blood is it’s not just a flavor thing. And it’s strong enough in Sam from what he’s been willingly ingesting they’d probably be impacted. So would it make the ghouls stronger? Or give them powers? Or adversely would it make them sick like food poisoning? Would it kill them? And by that matter what about other creatures? What would Sam’s blood do to a vampire? Or another human for that matter? Is Sam’s blood dangerous to other humans?   And instead - immediate headshot/Dean beating ghoul!Adam to death. No time to determine if it would have an impact and it’s never mentioned again. I haven’t been so frustrated since the Termites ate poor infected Bob’s leg and died via Rick and co. before any adverse effects appeared. Because it’d be an interesting twist alone if they were either made stronger or partially incapacitated by Sam’s blood to impact Dean’s fight with the ghouls (and imagine Sam and Dean dealing with the implications of that in the following episodes).  That said I would bet money this knowledge of the differences in his blood haunted Sam at some point. I can’t see him doing things like donating blood once he realized exactly what’s in his system.,2024-07-07 22:49:36 GMT

Then the literal next scene Dean is fighting with the angels and you can see from Sam’s reactions he’s not agreeing with what Dean’s doing. If he did he would have said something to back Dean up.   First of all the audacity that Sam dare be mad Dean is getting angry as requested but not in the right way.   But second it’s very telling that Dean getting mad isn’t exactly was Sam wants. The angels are their allies. Sam doesn’t have to like them considering they don’t like him. But he can respect they’re on the same side. And frankly Sam is mostly on the same page as them at this point because they’re manipulating him. Even if they’re disgusted by what he’s doing he’s still needed to get what they want. Because at the end of the day Sam and the angels are willing to do what they think is right to get what they want. It’s just that Sam doesn’t have the whole picture.   And Dean is fighting that. Sam will fight that in season 5. It’s just that now Sam thinks Dean should have some fight in him towards Lilith because Sam wants revenge. And Dean thinks he isn’t worth revenge as much as it’s worth saving others. Because that’s his guiding principle even before his further loss of self-worth post-hell. And the getting the good guys to make the right calls is far more important to Dean than the fast track to revenge.,2024-07-08 00:11:05 GMT

U don’t have to like wincest but what do u mean “why is it so common”???  Did we not watch the same show?? Wincest is possibly the spn ship with the MOST subtext. I don’t rlly feel the need to even name all the reasons wincest makes sense cuz they’re so obvious and naming them all would take a while and that’s not rlly the point of this post.  Also why r u acting like wincest is a plague or invasive species in the spn fandom. Like the spn fandom was BUILT on wincest. It makes sense that a prominent part of the fandom are wincest shippers.   It’s like going to the ocean and seeing a sign warning of sharks and being like “aw:( why do sharks have to ruin the beach I just wanna swim” as if sharks aren’t an important and natural part of the ocean ecosystem. Like that’s their HOME. They’ve been here longer than YOU (the you is destiel shippers in this fuck ass analogy) if u don’t wanna risk being around sharks at the ocean you can go to a pool or lake (other fandoms) and if ur adamant on the ocean remember sharks aren’t bloodthirsty and horrible like they are in movies and if you stay away from ocean areas that are prominent with sharks you should be ok. And even if you come across a shark on a beach that usually dosent have sharks don’t panic! You can get out of the water. Sharks won’t attack you unless you antagonize them.

Reasons Dean didn’t talk about his possession by Michael when he came back in episode 3 of season 14  He was scared He was avoiding emotions He was trying to avoid his guilt (also why he told Sam that he didn’t remember things that happened while Michael was possessing him right away.)

You both sat quietly as you surveyed the desolate building a feeling of unease washing over you.   “Maybe we should wait for Sam” you suggested half heartedly. He was only down at the Sheriff’s station and it wouldn’t even take ten minutes for him to meet you here but you knew Dean wouldn’t wait.   “No” he said confirming what you already knew. “Someone else is missing and this is our best lead so far. If you don’t want to go in that’s fine but I am.”   “I’m not letting you go in there alone” you snapped sitting up as tall as you could despite the pit forming in your stomach.   “Awe you worried about me sweetheart?” Dean teased turning to look at you with a grin; one that was effectively wiped from his face when he saw the look in your eyes. “Hey what is it?”   &lt;!-- more --&gt; “I don’t know” you said honestly shrugging lightly. “I just have a bad feeling about this.”   “Bad feeling like what?” he questioned his brows knitting together.   You thought about it trying to pinpoint what it was you felt but you couldn’t. “Just…. don’t go wandering off” you ended up saying- begging more like.   “Alright” he agreed easily. “We stick together and we’ll be in and out before you know it.”   “Right” you confirmed with a nod. “Let’s gear up.”   You exited the car as quietly as you could making your way around to the back as Dean unlocked the trunk and propped up the panel to the arsenal.  “You and Sam better be right about this” he muttered digging out the box of witch-killing bullets.   Your mind raced through the details of the case: An exsanguinated priest a dead nun with her tongue ripped out the president of the high schools abstinence club found without a heart and various livestock missing various body parts - if this wasn’t a witch you were a little scared to find out what else it could be.   “We have to be” you breathed out loading your ammo.   “Can you do me a favour and sound at least a little confident?” he asked playfully lightly nudging your arm with his own before tucking his gun into his jeans.   “Sorry” you said sheepishly holstering your own gun.   “It’s alright” he said earnestly handing you your favourite knife (one that used to be his before you claimed it as your own). “I’m just not used to seeing you so spooked.”   You couldn’t help but chuckle quietly as you took the knife from him. “I’m not used to feeling spooked.”   “We’ll make it through” he consoled closing up the trunk. “Just like we always do.”   “Just like we always do” you echoed with a nod following him towards the building.   The overgrowth brushed your calves as you made your way up the walk and after a quick survey of the facade Dean swung the door open after picking the lock.   “Wait!” you hissed stopping him before he entered. “Sam does know we’re here right?”   You watched as his shoulders shrugged before stepping inside. “Probably.”   “That’s… comforting” you sighed following him across the threshold.   The two of you did a quick preliminary sweep of the main level before making your way to the top floor finding nothing of significance in any of the rooms. Making your way back down you both stopped dead in your tracks as you heard a clatter come from beneath you.   “Of course there’s a basement” Dean whispered. “Why wouldn’t the creepy ass witch be in the creepy ass basement of this creepy ass house?”   “How do you know she’s a creepy ass witch?” you teased raising an eyebrow at him. “Maybe she’s hot. Or a guy. Or both.”   He faltered over his response considering your words for a moment. “I’ll bet whatever tab you drink up at the bar once we end up ganking this bitch. She’s creepy.”   “Deal” you grinned wiggling your eyebrows at him.   You both chuckled before another noise from the basement drew your attention back to the case at hand. Dean awkwardly cleared his throat before leading the way in search of the basement entrance using the occasional noise as guidance.   “God I hate witches” he muttered to himself slapping away cobwebs as he descended the stairs.   “I don’t think the witch put those webs there” you said with a snicker.   “No they’re just the one turning this rotting corpse of a house into a lair of evil and despair” he hissed.   You rolled your eyes in response unable to stop the fond smile from creeping onto your face as you made it to the bottom of the stairs.   A muffled cry caught your attention and Dean spared you a quick look before running in the direction it came from you hot on his heels. Coming up on a corner he slowed to a halt and peered around the wall.   “It looks clear” he decided after a moment. “Just be careful” he added continuing on his way.   Upon turning the corner you were enveloped in the warm glow of candles which would have been nice had it not been for the rest of the scene. An altar lay at the far wall burning candelabras stood in each corner of the room and the very person you were searching for was bound and gagged in a chair in the middle of the room surrounded by a circle of candles.   Dean cursed and muttered under his breath surveying the room. “I’ll get him you get the altar.“  “Okay” you agreed running across the room. Once you reached the altar you couldn’t help but stare in shock and disgust for a moment as you took in the sight; all the missing body parts seemingly staring back at you from where they lay soaked in blood. It took Dean shouting your name from across the room to bring you back to your senses and you quickly upturned the altar as Dean instructed the now freed man to get out as fast as possible and wait by the car. As soon as the contents of the altar were scattered an ear piercing shriek came from behind you.   Quickly whirling on your heels you were greeted by a cloaked figure who seemingly came out of nowhere.   “What have you done?” she screamed dropping her hood as she stared daggers into you.   “Oh I’m sorry” you feigned innocence. “Did I ruin your big plan?”  “You ruined everything!” she shrieked slowly approaching you. “You’ll pay for this!”   “Yeah I don’t think so” Dean called out from behind her.   “Do you have any idea how long I’ve waited for this?! How many centuries passed by until the circumstances were right? I had it! I had it all! I was one spell away from seeing my love again!” she continued to scream advancing further towards you as she ignored Dean.  “Back off Grunhilda!” Dean roared from behind her drawing his gun.   “No!” she shrieked barely lifting her hand in order to easily swing his gun away - and stop you from drawing your own. “You stupid little gnat. You think you can just come in here and mess with things you don’t understand? You think you can take this from me?!”   Her shouting was drowned out by the sound of your own heart pounding in your ears your entire body feeling like it was on fire as your throat constricted the air leaving your lungs and not returning. You felt your bones cracking beneath your skin as your feet left the floor and you shared a look of terror with Dean before black began to cloud the edges of your vision.   Without an effective weapon handy Dean rushed the witch and tackled her to the floor sending you crashing down. You met the concrete with a thud and it knocked the rest of your senses out of you. You laid there for who knows how long fighting off the waves of pain and nausea willing yourself to move as you listened to the struggle happening a few feet away from you.   By the time you managed to prop yourself up Dean was pinned down as she advanced on him and you desperately looked around for either of your guns.   “Do you have any idea what it’s like?” you heard her ask menace laced deep in her words. “To want something so desperately to feel that desire within your very soul?!”   Dean struggled against her hold as you struggled to pick yourself up to at least crawl to a weapon if you had to.  “Well you will” she sneered cackling to herself. “You’ll know how it feels. To have what you want the very most to be so close to you to have it at the edge of your fingertips only to never be able to grasp it! For it to be the only thing you can think about!”  “Shut the hell up” Dean seethed through clenched teeth glaring at her.   She only stepped closer towards him cackling to herself. “Your strongest yearning hidden deep in your heart will nevermore be yours to part. Be it with sun or with rain that which brings joy won’t be without pain.”   “You finished yet?” Dean interrupted before he had the wind knocked out of him rendering him silent.   Moving as quickly as you could without being noticed you closed in on Dean’s pistol while the witch carried on.   “Whatever you crave you cannot say yet you’ll seek it out be it night or day” she continued hovering over him. “Consider yourself lucky you useless toad. I’ve had countless lifetimes yearning to see my love again and I’ll spend lifetimes more. At least you only have this one measly little life to yearn for what you want.”   Grasping the gun in your hands you carefully rose to your feet and steadied yourself to take aim. “Man you really do talk too much” you huffed out.  The shot rang out just as she turned towards you though it was silenced by a roaring wind that accompanied a bright blue light. Within seconds everything was calm and quiet again.  Fighting every urge you had to collapse back onto the floor you trudged your way over to Dean in an attempt to help him up.   “God I told you she’d be creepy” he gasped out groaning as he stood.   “You want a prize?” you asked incredulously staring up at him.   “I wanna get the hell out of here” he said ushering you to take leave. “Then I want those drinks you owe me.”   After what felt like another entire day you and Dean had dropped the victim off at the hospital patched each other up cleaned out the basement showered and filled Sam in on everything that went down.   “So… she cursed you?” Sam asked curiously trying to understand.   “I dunno. She tried to I guess” Dean replied nonchalantly. “But Y/N/N put a bullet in her. No witch no curse right?”   Sam shared a brief look with you before turning back to Dean. “Yeah but… there was no body.”   “What?” Dean asked gruffly.   “The witch” you said. “I shot but she vanished. What if she isn’t dead?”   “Well I feel normal so I’m gonna say she’s dead” Dean declared with a shrug. “Now can we head to the bar? I’m in desperate need of a drink… or twelve.”   Without waiting for an answer he quickly stood and donned his jacket before looking back at you and Sam. “You guys coming or what?”   “Oh do I have a choice to not go?” you asked playfully.  “You can stay if you want but your wallet comes with me” he replied smiling innocently.   “Alright let’s go” you said with a dramatic sigh grabbing your own jacket.   Not long after the three of you were sliding into a booth in the nearest dive enjoying the lack of people; you guys seriously needed to decompress.   “Alright I’ll be back” you declared hopping out of the booth to get the first round of drinks.   “Make sure you get a tab started!” Dean jokingly called after you.   You flipped him off in response taking a seat at the bar after placing your order. While you waited Sam watched as Dean grew more restless in his seat.   “Dude what the hell is your problem?” he finally asked eyeing Dean as he fidgeted anxiously.   “What?” Dean asked cluelessly glancing around the bar. “I’m thirsty. She’s been gone for what like half an hour?”   “It’s… barely been two minutes Dean” Sam informed him with an amused grin.   “Yeah well. I want my beer” Dean mumbled tapping his fingers on the table as he glanced around once more. “I’m gonna go see if she needs help.”  Before Sam could even reply Dean was already halfway across the bar meeting you just as you got your final drink.   “Need a hand?” Dean asked cheerfully his sudden appearance making you jump. “Sorry” he added with a snicker.   “Dick” you muttered with a laugh hopping down from the stool. “Here you go” you added handing him his beer.  “Awesome” he beamed taking the bottle from your outstretched hand.   He followed closely as you made your way back to the table handing Sam his drink before sliding into the booth; Dean followed suit leaving you nestled in between him and the wall.   The three of you had a few more rounds before Dean slipped away determined to teach a lesson to the arrogant ass harassing players around the pool tables - just because you didn’t need to hustle people anymore didn’t mean it wasn’t still fun every now and then. You watched him fondly laughing quietly to yourself as you watched him fumble around with his cue before making a terrible break. Harder than it looks you could just hear him say.   Your attention was turned back to Sam when he cleared his throat and you were met with his questioning gaze. “Does he seem weird to you?”   “Weird how?” you asked face scrunched in confusion.   “I don’t know strange” he replied with a small shrug. “Like- like antsy or something.”   Your eyes flit back across the room to Dean who was very much in his element as he upped his ante before focusing on Sam again. “I haven’t noticed anything Sammy.”   He sighed in resignation seeming to already know that would be your response. “It’s probably nothing just forget I said anything” he replied shaking his head dismissively before finishing his drink.   “If you say so” you muttered quietly sipping your drink as you cast a worried gaze across the bar getting lost in thought.  By the time you each finished another round of drinks Dean made his way back over to the table; much to the surprise of you and Sam.   “Done so soon?” Sam questioned raising an eyebrow at his brother.   “Yeah” Dean shrugged sliding back into the seat beside you.  “But you only played one round” you said quizzically.   “So?” Dean wondered gulping down the rest of his beer.   “So you usually play a lot more than that” Sam pitched in shifting his gaze between you and Dean.   Dean sighed his bottle clanging on the table as he set it back down. “Why am I getting the third degree here? I played a game he learned his lesson I got over it. End of story.”  “Okay grouchy” you snickered ruffling his hair a little just because you knew he hated it. Except he really did love it when it was you doing it.  “Whatever anyone want another round?” he asked with a huff lightly swatting your hand away.   “No I’m gonna call it a night” you admitted shifting to slip your jacket back on.   “Yeah me too” Sam declared starting to stand from the table.   Dean stood as well assumingly just to let you out. “Alright let’s go.”  You and Sam both stilled in your movements at his response sharing a shocked look with each other. “You’re… coming with us?”   “Why wouldn’t I?” he asked with a scoff shrugging his jacket on as he looked questioningly between you and Sam. “Seriously what the hell is wrong with you guys?”  “We just didn’t expect you to call it a night so early” Sam explained helplessly. “Gettin’ old huh?” he added trying to lighten the mood a little.   “Yeah I mean you barely even wracked up a tab!” you declared with a laugh before grinning mischievously. “Drinks just don’t agree with you anymore do they old man?”  Dean scoffed and rolled his eyes fixing his collar just to busy his hands. “Okay alright one more wisecrack and I’m leaving you both here.”   Despite the finality in his tone the amusement dancing in his eyes gave him away - as did the hand he extended to you to help you slide from the booth.   “Whatever you say grandpa” Sam teased patting Dean on the shoulder before walking away with laughter in his wake. “I’ll be outside!”  You chuckled in response and the stern look Dean gave you only made you laugh even more. “Yeah yeah. Hurry it up chuckles” he chided wiggling his fingers at you. He surveyed the bar as you finally took hold of his hand sliding out from your seat with ease and standing before him. “Ready?” he asked gaze turning back to look down at you.   “Yeah I just gotta go pay” you replied nodding your head in the direction of the bar counter.   “Alright” he said with a nod. He gave your hand a squeeze though instead of letting go like he normally would he held it firmly as he led the way across the bar.   You followed along quietly trying your hardest to not read too much into it. Though when you stood before the bar and he had yet to release your hand you gave him a puzzled look. “Did you wanna go get the car?” you asked hesitantly.   He looked confused for a moment as if he wasn’t entirely sure what was going on either before he cleared his throat with a curt nod. “Yeah. Yeah I’ll meet you out there. Don’t take too long” he rushed giving your hand another fleeting squeeze before shuffling away.   Strange you thought briefly before shifting your attention to the bartender before you.   As you paid the tab Dean settled into the driver’s seat of Baby and Sam watched him impatiently drum his fingers against the wheel as he hummed along to whatever song was in his head; and he couldn’t help but snort a laugh as Dean checked his watch one two three times since getting into the car.   “You’re ridiculous” Sam chided with a laugh shaking his head.   “What?” Dean inquired annoyance clear in his voice.   “Dude please tell me you see what’s going on” Sam pleaded.   Dean widened his eyes in confusion glancing around the near empty parking lot before looking back at his brother. “What’s going on?”   Before Sam could reply their attention was caught by the opening of the bar’s door when you emerged from the building a grin forming on your face as you caught sight of them waiting in the car.   Dean matched your grin quickly reaching for the door handle and scrambling outside. “There she is!” he greeted happily opening the back door for you.   “Fucking idiot” Sam muttered to himself staring out the window with an amused grin as you and Dean settled into your seats.   The three of you made it back in no time and having to settle for a single bed when first getting to town over driving for another who-knows-how-long just to find another motel shuffled out of the car and into your shared room with heavy feet.  “Finally” Dean muttered with relief shutting the door behind him as Sam took a seat. “Whoa whoa” Dean barked holding up a hand. “What’re you doing?”   Sam froze just as he sat on the bed staring up at his brother. “What?”   “That’s my bed” Dean declared with a huff.   “No it’s not” Sam answered with a scoff. “It’s your turn for the couch.”   “Dude I’m not sleeping on the pull-out!” Dean declared with finality.  “What are you kidding me?” Sam asked incredulously. “You got the bed last time!”   “Yeah and I just got ragdolled by a crazy ass witch I deserve a mattress!” Dean argued stepping towards the bed. “Get up.”   “No” Sam argued stubbornly relaxing further atop the sheets.   “You guys are ridiculous” you said with an exasperated sigh walking across the room. “I’ll take the couch.”   “Not a chance” Dean denied not even sparing you a glance.   “What why?” you asked in confusion.   “First of all I’m not sharing with Sam” Dean replied turning to look at you. “Second you got it worse than I did. I’m not shoving you on a pull-out.”   “Oh please-” you started to argue before he cut you off.   “I patched you up myself Y/N. Don’t bother trying to lie to me” he cautioned.   You opened your mouth to argue once more but the look on his face stopped you short. “Whatever” you mumbled turning towards the bathroom. “I’m getting ready for bed. Figure this out before I get back so I can actually go to bed please.”   The bickering resumed as you quickly retreated shutting the bathroom door on Dean’s disgruntled declaration of “best two out of three.”  By the time you re-entered the room you were met with silence. Surveying the surroundings you found Sam digging through his toiletries bag while sitting in his original spot on the bed. Your gaze snapped over to the couch where Dean sat looking like a kicked puppy.   “You went with scissors again didn’t you?” you asked raising an eyebrow at him.   He met your gaze as Sam snickered behind you causing his face to sour even more. “Shut up” he mumbled before standing bristling past you with slumped shoulders.   You chuckled quietly to yourself and grabbed the spare sheets quickly making up the pull-out for Dean while he got ready; hopefully he’d be a little less cranky about it all if this was at least already done.   Once finished you made your way over to the bed and curled up under the covers. After saying a quick goodnight to Sam you were asleep before Dean even left the bathroom.   Fear gnawed at Dean his body frozen in place as a cold spread through him panic clinging to him like ice. He tried to call out to you but all that left him was a strangled breath as his lungs seized up. He watched as the waves carried you away further and further from where he stood. By the time his legs finally moved to carry him closer to shore his feet were so heavy it was as though he was wading through quicksand.   “No no no” he pleaded quietly watching as the waters edge never grew near no matter how far he ran.   Your voice cried out to him surging him forward even faster as you drifted ever outwards terror seeping deeper into his bones with every futile step he took.  He couldn’t reach you.   He couldn’t save you.   The realisation that you were gone caused his world to come crashing down around him as he fell to his knees. A roaring filled his ears and he didn’t know whether it was the irascible water that held you captive or the blood racing from his pounding heart.   As he stayed there - watching the crashing waves for any sign of you listening for a call of his name unwilling to move for fear he’d miss you - the water suddenly crept up around him as if to mock him.   The sky darkened as he let out an anguished cry his voice blending in with the storm beginning to brew around him. Yet despite the deafening howls he heard it clear as day: your voice calling out to him.   “Dean.”  The world stilled around him once more your voice ringing out in a whisper as gentle as the wind.   “Dean.”   He stood frantically searching the horizon for you. He tried to call out yet his voice still never came.   “Dean!” you called out voice booming like thunder from above.   A small hand gripped his own pulling him so forcefully he was yanked off his feet. He let out a startled cry a spark of lightning igniting so brightly before him that he screwed his eyes shut.   “God dammit Dean!”   Another force shook him and when we reopened his eyes he was met with the suspiciously stained ceiling of the motel room. He bolted upright heart hammering against his chest as he looked around. He caught your worried gaze as he wiped the sweat from his brow trying to steady his breathing as you leaned in closer.   “Y/N?” he gasped out pushing himself further upright.  His hand reached out automatically fingers tentatively brushing against your cheek as if to evaluate your solidity. When he was satisfied that you wouldn’t evaporate he surged forward to wrap you in a desperate embrace; the icy grip of terror finally starting to melt.   “It was just a nightmare De” you soothed quietly tracing a hand along his back. “Everything’s alright.”  “Yeah” he said tightly swallowing the lump forming in his throat as he let you go. “Yeah it’s fine. I’m alright get back to bed.”   “You’re okay?” you questioned concern laced in both your face and tone of voice.   “I’m okay” he affirmed with a nod casting his gaze aside so you wouldn’t see the panic still swirling within him.   “Okay” you said softly placing a gentle kiss upon the crown of his head before standing from the edge of the pull-out.   Dean got up after you to grab a glass of water his heart jumping in his chest as he remembered the sight of you being ripped away by the current.   “Just a nightmare” he reminded himself under his breath. “Just a nightmare.”   Not having slept another wink after his nightmare Dean was unsurprisingly the first one up the next morning. Taking it upon himself to get breakfast for the three of you he found himself at the nearest diner waiting for his order.   Drumming his fingers impatiently on the sticky linoleum counter a burning desire to call you began to build within him. Knowing you were likely still sleeping he decided to busy himself with a stupid game you downloaded on his phone.   Yet the urge to reach out to you grew tenfold as he sat there a sinking feeling that it might mean you were in danger starting to take hold of him. Just as his mind began to swirl with questions of what the hell was going on with him he heard your voice calling his name.   His head snapped up expecting to see you sliding onto the stool beside him ready to give you hell for walking here in search of him all by yourself in a random town. He figured you must’ve known he was here and it wouldn’t have been a far walk from the motel but it was still stupid.  Though the words died on his tongue as he realized you weren’t there and that familiar feeling of dread trickled through him after scanning the diner and not finding you anywhere.   Another voice called out this time the waitress announcing that his order was ready. He met her smiling face with nothing but confusion her smile faltering for a moment.  “Everything alright?” she asked hesitantly.  “Huh?” he asked before snapping out of his daze. “Oh yeah. Just a little too early for me. Thanks-” he paused squinting to read her name tag. “Thanks Edna” he charmed flashing his signature grin as he gathered the order.   “Anytime sugar” she charmed her smile perking back up as she sent him a wink.   With one last - albeit awkward - grin sent her way Dean quickly left the diner; already feeling lighter for knowing he’d be back at the motel soon. His grin only grew when he glanced across the street and caught a glimpse of you staring back at him proving that he wasn’t crazy and you really did come to meet him.   He took a step forward intending to call out to you when a truck drove by and blocked you from sight. The grin was wiped from his face and the coffee tray nearly slipped out of his hand when he noticed you had completely disappeared in its wake.   Fearing the worst once more he scrambled into the car and quickly called you firing Baby to life as the line rang.   “Hey” you answered with a stifled yawn. “Please tell me you’re getting breakfast. And coffee.”   “Yeah I-” he faltered in his response having to let out a breath of relief as he realized you were safe and sound. “I’ll be back in a few you and Sammy still there?”   “Where else would we be?” you asked with a giggle.   While the sound would normally bring a smile to his face your words only caused a frown to appear. “You only waking up now?”   “Don’t judge me” you teased. “It’s only… ten after seven I barely slept in.”   “Just not used to being up before you” he lied knuckles turning white as he gripped the steering wheel.   “Miracles really do happen” you joked with a laugh. “You sound weird is everything okay?” you added worry tinting your voice.   “Hm?” he wondered not processing your question right away. “Oh no- yeah I-… just didn’t get much sleep.”  “Right” you said teetering on the edge of believing him or not.   “Really I’m good” he assured sensing your apprehension. “I just gotta catch some z’s and I’ll be good as new.”   “Okay. I’ll see you in a few then” you relented. “Drive safe” you added as an afterthought before hanging up.   The line went dead as he stopped at a red light his stomach churning as he stared at his reflection in the rearview.  “Just need some sleep” he assured himself.   “Dude would you quit it with the pacing?” Sam snapped setting his book down on the table for sheer lack of concentration.   Dean stopped just long enough to stare daggers at his brother before marching down the library once more. “She’s been gone too long.”   “She’s been gone an hour” Sam informed hands running over his face in exasperation.   “Exactly” Dean replied pointing a finger at Sam in acknowledgment. “Something must’ve happened.”   “Dude she’s at the grocery store. With Jack. What the hell could possibly happen?”   “I don’t know!” Dean exclaimed arms flailing as he whirled to face Sam. “Something must’ve! She hasn’t answered my last text and it’s been-” he paused pulling out his phone to brandish the screen. “Seven minutes!”   “Oh my god” Sam groaned tossing his head back to stare at the ceiling. “I can’t deal with this anymore.”   “What are you talking about? Aren’t you worried?” Dean asked gruffly.   “No Dean I’m not worried! There’s no reason to be worried!” Sam proclaimed.   “No reason? She could be dead!” Dean barked his face taking on an expression of disbelief.   Sam sighed as he leaned over the table raising his eyebrows. “Okay let me ask you this: why exactly do you think she’s dead?”   “Oh come on Sam!” Dean grumbled. “We don’t exactly live cookie cutter lives here you know. One minute she’s returning the shopping cart and the next she’s got a damn knife in her back!”   “Dean” Sam soothed. “You know as well as I do that’s a load of crap.”   “No” Dean argued shaking his head. “We don’t know that. We don’t know anything you know why?”   Before Sam could even respond Dean waved his phone around before dropping it on the table. “Because she won’t answer her damn phone!”   “Okay this is actually ridiculous” Sam declared. “How can you seriously not see what’s been happening to you?”   “Knock it off Sam” Dean muttered waving a hand dismissively as he began pacing again. “I’m fucking fine.”   “You’re fine” Sam repeated incredulously. “You’re friggin’ cursed Dean!”   “I’m not cursed!” shouted Dean. “Would you quit it with that crap?”   “Right because nothing’s been going on with you lately right?”   “Right!” Dean agreed with a huff.   “You haven’t been say I don’t know…. not sleeping? Feeling stir crazy? Getting paranoid?”  “Sam-”   “No I’m serious Dean! How can you not see this?”   “Because I’m fine!” Dean argued stalling his movements to gather his phone from the table.  After a few moments of silence Dean rolled his eyes and found himself once more walking the length of the library. “Okay maybe I’ve been feeling a little weird lately but I’ve just been tired - and you know what? I survived worse. So yeah I’m fine!”   “Right” Sam said sceptically. “And have you… noticed when it is that you feel… weird?”  “I don’t know!” Dean announced frustratedly.  “Dean” Sam chastised.   “What?”   “You’ve been feeling like this all week and it’s only getting worse. You’ve been like this since that witch cursed you - and don’t say she didn’t. Use your fucking head Dean! You’re cursed!”   Dean’s jaw clenched as he tried to remain calm taking a moment to formulate his response. “You’re insane” he finally declared.   “I think you’re the insane one” Sam contested. “You were cursed to yearn for something Dean. Only in this case… it’s someone.”   “What the hell are you talking about?”   “C’mon Dean!” Sam pleaded with a laugh. “The only time you get like this is when you’re more than ten feet away from Y/N.”   “You don’t know what you’re talking about” Dean muttered dismissively.   “You’ve checked your phone another five times since you picked it up.”   “So?” Dean questioned failing to resist the urge to check it once more. “I’m worried not cursed.”   “You’re worried because you’re cursed!” Sam argued.   “I’m worried because I lo-” Dean quickly fell silent as the words died on his tongue his brain firing into total overdrive as he laughed nervously. “I care that’s why I’m worried.”   Sam stared at his brother in total disbelief trying to find a way to make him realize what was going on- or most likely acknowledge what was going on.   Yet before the conversation could go any further the bunker door screeched open and the sound of your laughter fleeted down to greet Dean effectively turning his scowl into an affectionate grin.   “Hope you remembered my pie!” he called out marching to meet you at the foot of the stairs without so much as a glance back in Sam’s direction.   “When have I ever forgotten?” you asked feigning offence as you held out the bag which contained his pie.  “Well” he started taking the bag from you. “There was that time in Redford-”  “Hey!” you interrupted with a laugh. “I didn’t forget they were out!”  “See I still don’t believe you” he teased heading for the kitchen.   “Believe whatever you want Dean” you replied playfully.   “I’m still waiting for it you know. You should get me two next time” he joked though he was partly serious.   “Dean?” Sam’s voice tentatively called out.  “Yeah?” Dean replied hotly keeping his back to Sam as he went to grab a beer from the fridge.   “Who uh… who the hell are you talking to?” he asked carefully surveying the empty kitchen.   “Hilarious Sam” he said dryly shutting the fridge. “I’m talking to-”  His mouth ran dry as he turned around being met with just his brother who was staring with concern from the doorway.   “Y/N” Dean finished weakly.   “Her and Jack aren’t back yet Dean” Sam said carefully as though talking to a lost child.   “Yes they are. They got back she gave me my pie we came in here” Dean said fiercely his confidence shattering when he went to gesture at the pie he set down moments earlier and found it to be gone.   “Maybe you should sit down” Sam suggested not knowing what to do.   “I’m fine!” Dean shouted hovering over the counter. “I’m fine” he repeated moreso to himself than anything.   “Okay look how about I try calling Y/N okay?” Sam offered hesitantly walking further into the kitchen. “See when they’ll be back.”   “They are back!” Dean barked glaring at Sam. “She was just in here!”   Sam didn’t know what to say the fear and concern for his brother crashing down on him.   “She was just in here” Dean repeated shakily meeting Sam’s gaze with confusion.   “Dean” Sam started to say before the familiar tone of your ringtone came from Dean’s phone cutting through the air like a knife.   Dean pulled the phone from his pocket clearing his throat before answering. “Yeah?”   “Dean thank god” you cheered sighing in relief. “Listen we came out to a flat tire and I don’t have a spare because I forgot to fucking replace it and there are too many people around for Jack to you know try fixing it” you rambled anxiously. “Can you please come help?”   “You’re still at the store?” Dean clarified looking up at Sam with frightened eyes.   “Yeah we’re stuck in the parking lot” you told him breezily.   “Okay” he said swallowing thickly. “Alright I’ll be right there.”   “Thanks De!” you said happily ending the call.   Dean stood there for a few moments staring down at his unopened bottle of beer on the counter trying to gather his thoughts before finally lifting his gaze to Sam.  “I’ll uh…. I’ll be back” he told him not waiting for a response before trudging out of the kitchen.  You found yourself yet again rushing down the hall to Dean’s room his muffled yells waking you in the dead of night once more.   He uttered your name as you shut the door behind you and though it took you by surprise the very first time it happened - nearly two weeks ago now - it was something you’ve almost come to expect. It was killing you watching him go through this every night and not being able to fix it. You would sit with him find ways to gently rouse him from his terror filled slumber and comfort him when he woke but it never seemed like enough; he deserved more.  At first you didn’t think there was too much going on figuring his shift in behaviour was just due to his lack of sleep. You didn’t believe Sam when he talked to you about it; Dean may have been acting a little more strange than usual but it didn’t raise any red flags.  It wasn’t until the morning following your conversation that you noticed it cluing in and realising how different Dean had been; how long he’d been different. The excess text messages the increase in phone calls the insistence on you not going anywhere without him and his exuberant reactions to you getting back safe when you did go somewhere without him his constant questioning on where you were or where you’ve just been. Something else was going on and you could only think it really did come down to the witch you two encountered. So you and Sam called up Rowena getting her take on the situation and figuring out what to do.   Her words now echoed through your head as you perched yourself on the edge of his bed: “Magic isn’t simple. Some curses are anchored by the witch ending whenever they were to die. But others are more complex rooted not in the witch but the object of the curse itself not breaking until their purpose is carried out one way or another. Perhaps if you can figure out what it is Dean needs you can break the curse yourselves. If this carries on for any longer… I’m worried it will kill him.”   While you ran your fingers through his hair you decided right then and there that once he woke up you wouldn’t leave without confronting him about it. You knew it would likely start a fight and you felt a little guilty knowing you would all but interrogate him right after having another nightmare but all that guilt flew right out the window the second Dean startled himself awake the sight of his panic stricken face as he gasped for air nearly bringing you to tears; you’ve seen him like this too often as of late.   “It’s alright Dean” you soothed reaching out to him. “I’m right here everything’s fine.”   His gaze snapped to you unable to hide the confusion and terror still coursing through him despite the relief he felt. “Y/N?”   “Yeah De” you cooed running a hand across his shoulder blades. “We’re in your room everyone’s okay.”   He let out a shuddering breath hanging his head in his hands. “You’re okay” he whispered softly. “You’re okay.”   You sat quietly with him for a few more minutes patiently comforting him as best as you could while you thought of how to approach this conversation.   Clearing his throat Dean was the first to speak again as he rose from the bed. “Sorry I woke you again.”   The dejection and shame laced in his voice tore your heart to bits and you had to put up a good fight to keep your emotions in check. “You don’t need to apologize.”   “Yeah I do” he disagreed trudging to his sink in the corner.   “Dean please talk to me” you pleaded watching as he turned on the water.   You fell silent waiting for him to deny you and brush you off again. You waited for him to say something to do something but all he did was stare at the running water.   “Dean?” you asked cautiously slowly getting up from the bed yourself.   “I can’t save you” he muttered quietly his gaze on the faucet unyielding.   “What?” you asked curiously not knowing what he meant.   “I can never save you” he carried on. “You always just… slip away from me. Every time. It’s always the same.”   “What’s always the same?” you questioned moving closer towards him.   “I try” he muttered seemingly oblivious to your presence. “I run and I fight and I try but I can never reach you. I can never get to you.”  He seemed to snap out of his daze a little moving to splash water over his face before turning off the tap. “You keep dying. I keep watching you die. I can’t watch you die again Y/N. I can’t.”   “This is what your nightmares have been?” you wondered.   He fell silent again for a minute before meeting your gaze in the mirror. “Yeah.”   “It’s not real Dean” you told him softly.  “It’s real enough for me” he muttered turning to face you.   “And is this why you’ve been… acting differently towards me?” you asked hesitantly.   He averted his gaze hanging his head as he considered your question. “I guess” he said with a shrug. “Maybe yeah. I don’t know.”   “Dean” you scolded with a sigh plopping back down on the bed. “Why won’t you just tell me what’s going on?”   “Because everything’s fine!” he argued once again.   “I’m not stupid Dean!” you challenged. “I know you. I can see something’s eating you alive and it’s fucking killing me to witness it. So please tell me what the hell is going on.”   “It’s just nightmares” he lied crossing his arms against his chest.   “It’s more than nightmares!” you cried. “You’re withering away into nothing Dean! I mean let’s face it! You’re practically a zombie nowadays with how little sleep you get you’ve been acting like a puppy with separation anxiety and let’s not forget how completely erratic you’ve been.”  He glared at you jaw clenching as he decided whether or not to entertain this conversation. “Okay so maybe I haven’t slept lately” he admitted starkly. “But like I keep saying I’m fine.”   “Don’t you ever get tired of lying?” you sneered glaring up at him.   He rolled his eyes averting his gaze to anywhere else as he shook his head. “No but I’m getting tired of having this conversation all the time.”   “Well too bad!” you yelled abruptly standing from the bed. “Cause I’m tired of never having this conversation go anywhere! I’m tired of you brushing off the idea of you being cursed. I didn’t believe it at first either but what the hell else could it be Dean?”   “Oh come on!” he barked running a hand over his face. “I see Sam got his hooks into you.”   “Yeah he did. And you need to listen to us.”   “No I really don’t” he scoffed starting to head to the door.   “Even if it kills you?” you blurted out.   “It’s not gonna kill me!”   “God look at you Dean! It already is!” you argued marching closer to him. “How would you feel if the situation were reversed?”   He let out a sigh pausing with his hand on the doorknob before turning back to you. “What?”   “What if it were me going through all this instead of you? Would you let me get away with not even listening to you and Sam?”   He narrowed his eyes at you staring at you in silence for so long you expected him to turn away again. Instead he let out a deep breath as he took a seat gesturing for you to carry on. “Five minutes.”   You almost went to argue before you thought better of it knowing full well that if Dean never came around to the theory he would actually cut you off at the five minute mark. So you did your best to recount the entire situation for him reiterating what you Sam and Rowena had to say about it all in the hopes of getting through to him. By the time you finished you knew it was well over five minutes so you took Dean not interrupting you to be a good sign.   “Okay” he finally said with a small nod. “Well I listened. Can I go now?”   Your heart dropped to your stomach anger and fear bubbling inside of you as you exploded. “God you are unbelievable!”  “Well what do you want me to say?” he grumbled. “I just don’t believe that’s what’s going on.”   “How can you not believe it?” you asked incredulously. “It’s obvious!”   “Look I said I don’t believe it alright?” Dean snapped. “Why are you so hellbent on making this into some big fight? Just accept it.”   “No!” you seethed. “I can’t just accept the fact that this could kill you. Especially not when there’s a way we could end this.”   “No” he disagreed shaking his head. “You can’t fix this Y/N/N. You just can’t.”   “I can!” you cried. “Just tell me.”   “Tell you what?”   “You know what” you scolded.   “This is so fucking ridiculous.”   “Tell me anyway.”   “Why the hell do you care so much?” he questioned exasperatedly.   “Because I’m fucking terrified Dean!” you exclaimed. “I’ve watched you grow more restless and anxious every day since the night we finished that case. I’ve seen the life drain from you more and more as sleep became nearly impossible for you. And I know it’s nearly impossible for you because I have spent the last eleven nights sitting on that bed as you got terrorised by your own mind. I don’t care if you believe in this curse or not Dean because I do.”   Dean stood quietly absorbing what you said as the severity of the situation began to dawn on him.   “I mean don’t you get it?” you asked sadly cutting through the silence. “If something happens to you if I lose you… that’s not something I can come back from.”   Dean fell silent once more running a hand through his hair as he took a deep breath pacing around the room a little as he turned everything over in his head.   “I’m scared Dean” you reiterated softly. “Please just let us try to fix this.”   “There’s some things I should tell you then” he admitted quietly after a moment of silence taking a seat on the bed.   “About what’s been happening?” you asked hopefully.   He nodded staring down at his hands folded in his lap. “Yeah.”   “Okay” you said moving his desk chair to take a seat. “I’m listening.”   He took a bracing breath taking a few minutes to build the courage to speak. “Well you know I’ve been having nightmares.”   “I do” you agreed quietly.   “It’s always the same one” he admitted keeping his gaze cast downwards. “I could never figure out why. It didn’t make sense to me why it was always the same thing. So I finally talked to Sam about it and he had a pretty good theory. But you know me. I didn’t want to believe it because it came back down to that witch and this stupid fucking curse.”   He let out a bitter laugh pausing long enough for you to speak up. “What did he have to say about it?”   “I tried telling myself I was fine” he continued ignoring your question. “I was fine at first. At first it was just not sleeping well… but then other things started happening.”   “Other things like what?” you wondered quietly.   “Like my blood feeling like it’s on fucking fire” he muttered wiping at his face. “And my skin feeling like it-… like it’s being peeled off my goddamn bones and my face feeling like it’s melting… and how I get this- this bubble inside my chest that feels like it’s either gonna burst or suffocate me and how it all only happens-” he stopped in his rambling taking a deep breath before chuckling in disbelief. “God it only happens when you’re not around Y/N.”   “I-… what do you mean?” you asked breathlessly.   “Oh come on Y/N” he said bitterly. “I know you’ve noticed. I text you more I’m almost always calling you. I just- I get this… this unwavering panic inside me when you’re not around. I keep-… I swear to god I see you everywhere when you’re gone. I catch sight of you across the street I smell your stupid shampoo when I’m alone I hear your voice when no one’s there. I had an entire conversation with you and you weren’t even there” he carried on shaking his head as he briskly wiped away an angry tear. “God I’m going fucking crazy” he added with a manic chuckle.   “You’re not crazy Dean” you said gently.   “That night” he started staring at the wall across from him. “She was trying to get back someone she lost… someone she loved.”   “Right” you agreed.   “They used to drown them people they accused of being witches” he continued slowly.   “Yeah it was pretty common. Sink and you were innocent. Float and you were guilty” you pitched in. “But… what does that have to do with this?”  “I think they were innocent” he said simply. “Whoever she lost… I think that’s how she lost them.”   “Why do you think that?” you asked curiously.   Dean cleared his throat staring pensively at his hands once more. “The nightmares. It’s always… you always drown. I keep-… I can never save you.”   “I don’t get-” you started to say before he cut you off.   “It’s how she lost who she loves Y/N” he said curtly. “It makes sense for me to see the one I love go the same way.”   “I-… what?” you asked too stunned to think of anything else to say.   “The dreams the hallucinations the- the way I’ve been feeling… I didn’t want to admit it I still don’t but I can’t… I mean I can only ignore it for so long right?” he said scoffing quietly. “Especially with you and Sam breathing down my neck about it.”   “Ignore what Dean?” you asked breathlessly your heart hammering in your chest.   “You” he muttered. “They way I feel about you. The way I’ve always felt about you.”   You didn’t dare respond his words ringing in your ears as he fell silent each of you lost in your own thoughts for a while.   “I’ve always known that I love you Y/N/N” he carried on slowly meeting your gaze with glistening eyes. “But this… this curse this whatever it is. God it’s just made it all so much worse and I knew. I knew it was you that my entire being was screaming out for but I couldn’t… I couldn’t admit it.”   “Why not?” you asked shakily feeling your tears starting to build.   “How could I put that on you?” he asked a few rogue tears slipping down his face. “You said it yourself this thing is killing me. It’s gonna kill me unless I get what I want and given that that’s you I’m calling it game over.”   “No Dean it’s not” you denied with a sniffle cutting through your own stray tears. “You should’ve told me.”   “Yeah well” he grumbled shrugging lightly as he looked back at his hands. “I told you now.”   “Dean” you sighed wiping your face as you stood from your seat. “Do you trust me?” you asked walking towards him.  “Of course I do” he said quickly almost offended by the question.   “Okay well I’ll need you to trust me on this” you replied stopping just in front of where he sat.   “Okay” he said with a huff.   “You gotta look at me though” you said laughing softly.   Sighing dejectedly he slowly lifted his head to meet your gaze a ghost of a smile dancing on his lips as he looked at you.   You smiled softly at him gently taking his face in your hands before wordlessly bringing your lips down to meet his. At first neither of you really knew what was happening and just when you thought to pull away you felt his lips moving against your own. His hands gripped your waist to hold you in place a moment longer before you each pulled away staring silently at each other as you processed what just happened.   “What uh… what was that for?” Dean finally asked.   “Well it was either that or slapping some sense into you” you said playfully. “Which I almost think you still deserve because I can’t believe you honestly think I don’t love you back.”   “What?” he asked his grip on your waist loosening in shock before tightening once more.   “You’ve had me since the day we met Dean” you told him softly carding your fingers through his hair.   “You actually…” he trailed off quietly trying to focus his thoughts. “You actually love me of all people?”   “Yeah” you said quietly. “I do.”   “So I- well I guess I could’ve saved a lot of trouble if I really did just tell you huh?” he asked jokingly laughing tightly.   “I’ll give you hell for it tomorrow” you teased half serious. “For now how about we try getting you back to sleep?”   “Actually” he said eyes sparkling with mischief. “I have a better idea involving this bed.”   You couldn’t help but snort a laugh grinning fondly at him. “Oh really?”   He grinned back laughing with you before taking on a more sombre tone. “Do you trust me?”   “Always” you said honestly.   “Good” he replied with a grin laughing heartily at the shriek you let out when he tossed you on the bed.   He stared down at you a look you’ve never seen before painted on his face. “What?” you asked giggling nervously.  “I love you” he said earnestly brushing a lock of hair away from your face.   “I love you too” you replied shyly grinning softly.   He matched your grin drinking you in a moment longer before crashing his lips upon yours once more.   When Dean woke the next morning it didn’t take long for a grin to spread across his face as he quickly realized two things.   The first thing being that you the love of his life still remained tangled up in both his arms and the sheets sleeping peacefully atop his chest.   The second being that for the first time in a total of thirteen days he was able to sleep without being haunted by his nightmares.   He felt you stir and his grin widened as you nestled in closer tightening your grip on him as you slept. He planted a kiss against your temple pulling you in close as he blissfully settled in for another peaceful rest.   Maybe witches aren’t so bad.  tagging: @roseblue373   let me know if you’d like to be tagged!,2024-07-08 01:58:42 GMT

You both sat quietly as you surveyed the desolate building a feeling of unease washing over you.   “Maybe we should wait for Sam” you suggested half heartedly. He was only down at the Sheriff’s station and it wouldn’t even take ten minutes for him to meet you here but you knew Dean wouldn’t wait.   “No” he said confirming what you already knew. “Someone else is missing and this is our best lead so far. If you don’t want to go in that’s fine but I am.”   “I’m not letting you go in there alone” you snapped sitting up as tall as you could despite the pit forming in your stomach.   “Awe you worried about me sweetheart?” Dean teased turning to look at you with a grin; one that was effectively wiped from his face when he saw the look in your eyes. “Hey what is it?”   &lt;!-- more --&gt; “I don’t know” you said honestly shrugging lightly. “I just have a bad feeling about this.”   “Bad feeling like what?” he questioned his brows knitting together.   You thought about it trying to pinpoint what it was you felt but you couldn’t. “Just…. don’t go wandering off” you ended up saying- begging more like.   “Alright” he agreed easily. “We stick together and we’ll be in and out before you know it.”   “Right” you confirmed with a nod. “Let’s gear up.”   You exited the car as quietly as you could making your way around to the back as Dean unlocked the trunk and propped up the panel to the arsenal.  “You and Sam better be right about this” he muttered digging out the box of witch-killing bullets.   Your mind raced through the details of the case: An exsanguinated priest a dead nun with her tongue ripped out the president of the high schools abstinence club found without a heart and various livestock missing various body parts - if this wasn’t a witch you were a little scared to find out what else it could be.   “We have to be” you breathed out loading your ammo.   “Can you do me a favour and sound at least a little confident?” he asked playfully lightly nudging your arm with his own before tucking his gun into his jeans.   “Sorry” you said sheepishly holstering your own gun.   “It’s alright” he said earnestly handing you your favourite knife (one that used to be his before you claimed it as your own). “I’m just not used to seeing you so spooked.”   You couldn’t help but chuckle quietly as you took the knife from him. “I’m not used to feeling spooked.”   “We’ll make it through” he consoled closing up the trunk. “Just like we always do.”   “Just like we always do” you echoed with a nod following him towards the building.   The overgrowth brushed your calves as you made your way up the walk and after a quick survey of the facade Dean swung the door open after picking the lock.   “Wait!” you hissed stopping him before he entered. “Sam does know we’re here right?”   You watched as his shoulders shrugged before stepping inside. “Probably.”   “That’s… comforting” you sighed following him across the threshold.   The two of you did a quick preliminary sweep of the main level before making your way to the top floor finding nothing of significance in any of the rooms. Making your way back down you both stopped dead in your tracks as you heard a clatter come from beneath you.   “Of course there’s a basement” Dean whispered. “Why wouldn’t the creepy ass witch be in the creepy ass basement of this creepy ass house?”   “How do you know she’s a creepy ass witch?” you teased raising an eyebrow at him. “Maybe she’s hot. Or a guy. Or both.”   He faltered over his response considering your words for a moment. “I’ll bet whatever tab you drink up at the bar once we end up ganking this bitch. She’s creepy.”   “Deal” you grinned wiggling your eyebrows at him.   You both chuckled before another noise from the basement drew your attention back to the case at hand. Dean awkwardly cleared his throat before leading the way in search of the basement entrance using the occasional noise as guidance.   “God I hate witches” he muttered to himself slapping away cobwebs as he descended the stairs.   “I don’t think the witch put those webs there” you said with a snicker.   “No they’re just the one turning this rotting corpse of a house into a lair of evil and despair” he hissed.   You rolled your eyes in response unable to stop the fond smile from creeping onto your face as you made it to the bottom of the stairs.   A muffled cry caught your attention and Dean spared you a quick look before running in the direction it came from you hot on his heels. Coming up on a corner he slowed to a halt and peered around the wall.   “It looks clear” he decided after a moment. “Just be careful” he added continuing on his way.   Upon turning the corner you were enveloped in the warm glow of candles which would have been nice had it not been for the rest of the scene. An altar lay at the far wall burning candelabras stood in each corner of the room and the very person you were searching for was bound and gagged in a chair in the middle of the room surrounded by a circle of candles.   Dean cursed and muttered under his breath surveying the room. “I’ll get him you get the altar.“  “Okay” you agreed running across the room. Once you reached the altar you couldn’t help but stare in shock and disgust for a moment as you took in the sight; all the missing body parts seemingly staring back at you from where they lay soaked in blood. It took Dean shouting your name from across the room to bring you back to your senses and you quickly upturned the altar as Dean instructed the now freed man to get out as fast as possible and wait by the car. As soon as the contents of the altar were scattered an ear piercing shriek came from behind you.   Quickly whirling on your heels you were greeted by a cloaked figure who seemingly came out of nowhere.   “What have you done?” she screamed dropping her hood as she stared daggers into you.   “Oh I’m sorry” you feigned innocence. “Did I ruin your big plan?”  “You ruined everything!” she shrieked slowly approaching you. “You’ll pay for this!”   “Yeah I don’t think so” Dean called out from behind her.   “Do you have any idea how long I’ve waited for this?! How many centuries passed by until the circumstances were right? I had it! I had it all! I was one spell away from seeing my love again!” she continued to scream advancing further towards you as she ignored Dean.  “Back off Grunhilda!” Dean roared from behind her drawing his gun.   “No!” she shrieked barely lifting her hand in order to easily swing his gun away - and stop you from drawing your own. “You stupid little gnat. You think you can just come in here and mess with things you don’t understand? You think you can take this from me?!”   Her shouting was drowned out by the sound of your own heart pounding in your ears your entire body feeling like it was on fire as your throat constricted the air leaving your lungs and not returning. You felt your bones cracking beneath your skin as your feet left the floor and you shared a look of terror with Dean before black began to cloud the edges of your vision.   Without an effective weapon handy Dean rushed the witch and tackled her to the floor sending you crashing down. You met the concrete with a thud and it knocked the rest of your senses out of you. You laid there for who knows how long fighting off the waves of pain and nausea willing yourself to move as you listened to the struggle happening a few feet away from you.   By the time you managed to prop yourself up Dean was pinned down as she advanced on him and you desperately looked around for either of your guns.   “Do you have any idea what it’s like?” you heard her ask menace laced deep in her words. “To want something so desperately to feel that desire within your very soul?!”   Dean struggled against her hold as you struggled to pick yourself up to at least crawl to a weapon if you had to.  “Well you will” she sneered cackling to herself. “You’ll know how it feels. To have what you want the very most to be so close to you to have it at the edge of your fingertips only to never be able to grasp it! For it to be the only thing you can think about!”  “Shut the hell up” Dean seethed through clenched teeth glaring at her.   She only stepped closer towards him cackling to herself. “Your strongest yearning hidden deep in your heart will nevermore be yours to part. Be it with sun or with rain that which brings joy won’t be without pain.”   “You finished yet?” Dean interrupted before he had the wind knocked out of him rendering him silent.   Moving as quickly as you could without being noticed you closed in on Dean’s pistol while the witch carried on.   “Whatever you crave you cannot say yet you’ll seek it out be it night or day” she continued hovering over him. “Consider yourself lucky you useless toad. I’ve had countless lifetimes yearning to see my love again and I’ll spend lifetimes more. At least you only have this one measly little life to yearn for what you want.”   Grasping the gun in your hands you carefully rose to your feet and steadied yourself to take aim. “Man you really do talk too much” you huffed out.  The shot rang out just as she turned towards you though it was silenced by a roaring wind that accompanied a bright blue light. Within seconds everything was calm and quiet again.  Fighting every urge you had to collapse back onto the floor you trudged your way over to Dean in an attempt to help him up.   “God I told you she’d be creepy” he gasped out groaning as he stood.   “You want a prize?” you asked incredulously staring up at him.   “I wanna get the hell out of here” he said ushering you to take leave. “Then I want those drinks you owe me.”   After what felt like another entire day you and Dean had dropped the victim off at the hospital patched each other up cleaned out the basement showered and filled Sam in on everything that went down.   “So… she cursed you?” Sam asked curiously trying to understand.   “I dunno. She tried to I guess” Dean replied nonchalantly. “But Y/N/N put a bullet in her. No witch no curse right?”   Sam shared a brief look with you before turning back to Dean. “Yeah but… there was no body.”   “What?” Dean asked gruffly.   “The witch” you said. “I shot but she vanished. What if she isn’t dead?”   “Well I feel normal so I’m gonna say she’s dead” Dean declared with a shrug. “Now can we head to the bar? I’m in desperate need of a drink… or twelve.”   Without waiting for an answer he quickly stood and donned his jacket before looking back at you and Sam. “You guys coming or what?”   “Oh do I have a choice to not go?” you asked playfully.  “You can stay if you want but your wallet comes with me” he replied smiling innocently.   “Alright let’s go” you said with a dramatic sigh grabbing your own jacket.   Not long after the three of you were sliding into a booth in the nearest dive enjoying the lack of people; you guys seriously needed to decompress.   “Alright I’ll be back” you declared hopping out of the booth to get the first round of drinks.   “Make sure you get a tab started!” Dean jokingly called after you.   You flipped him off in response taking a seat at the bar after placing your order. While you waited Sam watched as Dean grew more restless in his seat.   “Dude what the hell is your problem?” he finally asked eyeing Dean as he fidgeted anxiously.   “What?” Dean asked cluelessly glancing around the bar. “I’m thirsty. She’s been gone for what like half an hour?”   “It’s… barely been two minutes Dean” Sam informed him with an amused grin.   “Yeah well. I want my beer” Dean mumbled tapping his fingers on the table as he glanced around once more. “I’m gonna go see if she needs help.”  Before Sam could even reply Dean was already halfway across the bar meeting you just as you got your final drink.   “Need a hand?” Dean asked cheerfully his sudden appearance making you jump. “Sorry” he added with a snicker.   “Dick” you muttered with a laugh hopping down from the stool. “Here you go” you added handing him his beer.  “Awesome” he beamed taking the bottle from your outstretched hand.   He followed closely as you made your way back to the table handing Sam his drink before sliding into the booth; Dean followed suit leaving you nestled in between him and the wall.   The three of you had a few more rounds before Dean slipped away determined to teach a lesson to the arrogant ass harassing players around the pool tables - just because you didn’t need to hustle people anymore didn’t mean it wasn’t still fun every now and then. You watched him fondly laughing quietly to yourself as you watched him fumble around with his cue before making a terrible break. Harder than it looks you could just hear him say.   Your attention was turned back to Sam when he cleared his throat and you were met with his questioning gaze. “Does he seem weird to you?”   “Weird how?” you asked face scrunched in confusion.   “I don’t know strange” he replied with a small shrug. “Like- like antsy or something.”   Your eyes flit back across the room to Dean who was very much in his element as he upped his ante before focusing on Sam again. “I haven’t noticed anything Sammy.”   He sighed in resignation seeming to already know that would be your response. “It’s probably nothing just forget I said anything” he replied shaking his head dismissively before finishing his drink.   “If you say so” you muttered quietly sipping your drink as you cast a worried gaze across the bar getting lost in thought.  By the time you each finished another round of drinks Dean made his way back over to the table; much to the surprise of you and Sam.   “Done so soon?” Sam questioned raising an eyebrow at his brother.   “Yeah” Dean shrugged sliding back into the seat beside you.  “But you only played one round” you said quizzically.   “So?” Dean wondered gulping down the rest of his beer.   “So you usually play a lot more than that” Sam pitched in shifting his gaze between you and Dean.   Dean sighed his bottle clanging on the table as he set it back down. “Why am I getting the third degree here? I played a game he learned his lesson I got over it. End of story.”  “Okay grouchy” you snickered ruffling his hair a little just because you knew he hated it. Except he really did love it when it was you doing it.  “Whatever anyone want another round?” he asked with a huff lightly swatting your hand away.   “No I’m gonna call it a night” you admitted shifting to slip your jacket back on.   “Yeah me too” Sam declared starting to stand from the table.   Dean stood as well assumingly just to let you out. “Alright let’s go.”  You and Sam both stilled in your movements at his response sharing a shocked look with each other. “You’re… coming with us?”   “Why wouldn’t I?” he asked with a scoff shrugging his jacket on as he looked questioningly between you and Sam. “Seriously what the hell is wrong with you guys?”  “We just didn’t expect you to call it a night so early” Sam explained helplessly. “Gettin’ old huh?” he added trying to lighten the mood a little.   “Yeah I mean you barely even wracked up a tab!” you declared with a laugh before grinning mischievously. “Drinks just don’t agree with you anymore do they old man?”  Dean scoffed and rolled his eyes fixing his collar just to busy his hands. “Okay alright one more wisecrack and I’m leaving you both here.”   Despite the finality in his tone the amusement dancing in his eyes gave him away - as did the hand he extended to you to help you slide from the booth.   “Whatever you say grandpa” Sam teased patting Dean on the shoulder before walking away with laughter in his wake. “I’ll be outside!”  You chuckled in response and the stern look Dean gave you only made you laugh even more. “Yeah yeah. Hurry it up chuckles” he chided wiggling his fingers at you. He surveyed the bar as you finally took hold of his hand sliding out from your seat with ease and standing before him. “Ready?” he asked gaze turning back to look down at you.   “Yeah I just gotta go pay” you replied nodding your head in the direction of the bar counter.   “Alright” he said with a nod. He gave your hand a squeeze though instead of letting go like he normally would he held it firmly as he led the way across the bar.   You followed along quietly trying your hardest to not read too much into it. Though when you stood before the bar and he had yet to release your hand you gave him a puzzled look. “Did you wanna go get the car?” you asked hesitantly.   He looked confused for a moment as if he wasn’t entirely sure what was going on either before he cleared his throat with a curt nod. “Yeah. Yeah I’ll meet you out there. Don’t take too long” he rushed giving your hand another fleeting squeeze before shuffling away.   Strange you thought briefly before shifting your attention to the bartender before you.   As you paid the tab Dean settled into the driver’s seat of Baby and Sam watched him impatiently drum his fingers against the wheel as he hummed along to whatever song was in his head; and he couldn’t help but snort a laugh as Dean checked his watch one two three times since getting into the car.   “You’re ridiculous” Sam chided with a laugh shaking his head.   “What?” Dean inquired annoyance clear in his voice.   “Dude please tell me you see what’s going on” Sam pleaded.   Dean widened his eyes in confusion glancing around the near empty parking lot before looking back at his brother. “What’s going on?”   Before Sam could reply their attention was caught by the opening of the bar’s door when you emerged from the building a grin forming on your face as you caught sight of them waiting in the car.   Dean matched your grin quickly reaching for the door handle and scrambling outside. “There she is!” he greeted happily opening the back door for you.   “Fucking idiot” Sam muttered to himself staring out the window with an amused grin as you and Dean settled into your seats.   The three of you made it back in no time and having to settle for a single bed when first getting to town over driving for another who-knows-how-long just to find another motel shuffled out of the car and into your shared room with heavy feet.  “Finally” Dean muttered with relief shutting the door behind him as Sam took a seat. “Whoa whoa” Dean barked holding up a hand. “What’re you doing?”   Sam froze just as he sat on the bed staring up at his brother. “What?”   “That’s my bed” Dean declared with a huff.   “No it’s not” Sam answered with a scoff. “It’s your turn for the couch.”   “Dude I’m not sleeping on the pull-out!” Dean declared with finality.  “What are you kidding me?” Sam asked incredulously. “You got the bed last time!”   “Yeah and I just got ragdolled by a crazy ass witch I deserve a mattress!” Dean argued stepping towards the bed. “Get up.”   “No” Sam argued stubbornly relaxing further atop the sheets.   “You guys are ridiculous” you said with an exasperated sigh walking across the room. “I’ll take the couch.”   “Not a chance” Dean denied not even sparing you a glance.   “What why?” you asked in confusion.   “First of all I’m not sharing with Sam” Dean replied turning to look at you. “Second you got it worse than I did. I’m not shoving you on a pull-out.”   “Oh please-” you started to argue before he cut you off.   “I patched you up myself Y/N. Don’t bother trying to lie to me” he cautioned.   You opened your mouth to argue once more but the look on his face stopped you short. “Whatever” you mumbled turning towards the bathroom. “I’m getting ready for bed. Figure this out before I get back so I can actually go to bed please.”   The bickering resumed as you quickly retreated shutting the bathroom door on Dean’s disgruntled declaration of “best two out of three.”  By the time you re-entered the room you were met with silence. Surveying the surroundings you found Sam digging through his toiletries bag while sitting in his original spot on the bed. Your gaze snapped over to the couch where Dean sat looking like a kicked puppy.   “You went with scissors again didn’t you?” you asked raising an eyebrow at him.   He met your gaze as Sam snickered behind you causing his face to sour even more. “Shut up” he mumbled before standing bristling past you with slumped shoulders.   You chuckled quietly to yourself and grabbed the spare sheets quickly making up the pull-out for Dean while he got ready; hopefully he’d be a little less cranky about it all if this was at least already done.   Once finished you made your way over to the bed and curled up under the covers. After saying a quick goodnight to Sam you were asleep before Dean even left the bathroom.   Fear gnawed at Dean his body frozen in place as a cold spread through him panic clinging to him like ice. He tried to call out to you but all that left him was a strangled breath as his lungs seized up. He watched as the waves carried you away further and further from where he stood. By the time his legs finally moved to carry him closer to shore his feet were so heavy it was as though he was wading through quicksand.   “No no no” he pleaded quietly watching as the waters edge never grew near no matter how far he ran.   Your voice cried out to him surging him forward even faster as you drifted ever outwards terror seeping deeper into his bones with every futile step he took.  He couldn’t reach you.   He couldn’t save you.   The realisation that you were gone caused his world to come crashing down around him as he fell to his knees. A roaring filled his ears and he didn’t know whether it was the irascible water that held you captive or the blood racing from his pounding heart.   As he stayed there - watching the crashing waves for any sign of you listening for a call of his name unwilling to move for fear he’d miss you - the water suddenly crept up around him as if to mock him.   The sky darkened as he let out an anguished cry his voice blending in with the storm beginning to brew around him. Yet despite the deafening howls he heard it clear as day: your voice calling out to him.   “Dean.”  The world stilled around him once more your voice ringing out in a whisper as gentle as the wind.   “Dean.”   He stood frantically searching the horizon for you. He tried to call out yet his voice still never came.   “Dean!” you called out voice booming like thunder from above.   A small hand gripped his own pulling him so forcefully he was yanked off his feet. He let out a startled cry a spark of lightning igniting so brightly before him that he screwed his eyes shut.   “God dammit Dean!”   Another force shook him and when we reopened his eyes he was met with the suspiciously stained ceiling of the motel room. He bolted upright heart hammering against his chest as he looked around. He caught your worried gaze as he wiped the sweat from his brow trying to steady his breathing as you leaned in closer.   “Y/N?” he gasped out pushing himself further upright.  His hand reached out automatically fingers tentatively brushing against your cheek as if to evaluate your solidity. When he was satisfied that you wouldn’t evaporate he surged forward to wrap you in a desperate embrace; the icy grip of terror finally starting to melt.   “It was just a nightmare De” you soothed quietly tracing a hand along his back. “Everything’s alright.”  “Yeah” he said tightly swallowing the lump forming in his throat as he let you go. “Yeah it’s fine. I’m alright get back to bed.”   “You’re okay?” you questioned concern laced in both your face and tone of voice.   “I’m okay” he affirmed with a nod casting his gaze aside so you wouldn’t see the panic still swirling within him.   “Okay” you said softly placing a gentle kiss upon the crown of his head before standing from the edge of the pull-out.   Dean got up after you to grab a glass of water his heart jumping in his chest as he remembered the sight of you being ripped away by the current.   “Just a nightmare” he reminded himself under his breath. “Just a nightmare.”   Not having slept another wink after his nightmare Dean was unsurprisingly the first one up the next morning. Taking it upon himself to get breakfast for the three of you he found himself at the nearest diner waiting for his order.   Drumming his fingers impatiently on the sticky linoleum counter a burning desire to call you began to build within him. Knowing you were likely still sleeping he decided to busy himself with a stupid game you downloaded on his phone.   Yet the urge to reach out to you grew tenfold as he sat there a sinking feeling that it might mean you were in danger starting to take hold of him. Just as his mind began to swirl with questions of what the hell was going on with him he heard your voice calling his name.   His head snapped up expecting to see you sliding onto the stool beside him ready to give you hell for walking here in search of him all by yourself in a random town. He figured you must’ve known he was here and it wouldn’t have been a far walk from the motel but it was still stupid.  Though the words died on his tongue as he realized you weren’t there and that familiar feeling of dread trickled through him after scanning the diner and not finding you anywhere.   Another voice called out this time the waitress announcing that his order was ready. He met her smiling face with nothing but confusion her smile faltering for a moment.  “Everything alright?” she asked hesitantly.  “Huh?” he asked before snapping out of his daze. “Oh yeah. Just a little too early for me. Thanks-” he paused squinting to read her name tag. “Thanks Edna” he charmed flashing his signature grin as he gathered the order.   “Anytime sugar” she charmed her smile perking back up as she sent him a wink.   With one last - albeit awkward - grin sent her way Dean quickly left the diner; already feeling lighter for knowing he’d be back at the motel soon. His grin only grew when he glanced across the street and caught a glimpse of you staring back at him proving that he wasn’t crazy and you really did come to meet him.   He took a step forward intending to call out to you when a truck drove by and blocked you from sight. The grin was wiped from his face and the coffee tray nearly slipped out of his hand when he noticed you had completely disappeared in its wake.   Fearing the worst once more he scrambled into the car and quickly called you firing Baby to life as the line rang.   “Hey” you answered with a stifled yawn. “Please tell me you’re getting breakfast. And coffee.”   “Yeah I-” he faltered in his response having to let out a breath of relief as he realized you were safe and sound. “I’ll be back in a few you and Sammy still there?”   “Where else would we be?” you asked with a giggle.   While the sound would normally bring a smile to his face your words only caused a frown to appear. “You only waking up now?”   “Don’t judge me” you teased. “It’s only… ten after seven I barely slept in.”   “Just not used to being up before you” he lied knuckles turning white as he gripped the steering wheel.   “Miracles really do happen” you joked with a laugh. “You sound weird is everything okay?” you added worry tinting your voice.   “Hm?” he wondered not processing your question right away. “Oh no- yeah I-… just didn’t get much sleep.”  “Right” you said teetering on the edge of believing him or not.   “Really I’m good” he assured sensing your apprehension. “I just gotta catch some z’s and I’ll be good as new.”   “Okay. I’ll see you in a few then” you relented. “Drive safe” you added as an afterthought before hanging up.   The line went dead as he stopped at a red light his stomach churning as he stared at his reflection in the rearview.  “Just need some sleep” he assured himself.   “Dude would you quit it with the pacing?” Sam snapped setting his book down on the table for sheer lack of concentration.   Dean stopped just long enough to stare daggers at his brother before marching down the library once more. “She’s been gone too long.”   “She’s been gone an hour” Sam informed hands running over his face in exasperation.   “Exactly” Dean replied pointing a finger at Sam in acknowledgment. “Something must’ve happened.”   “Dude she’s at the grocery store. With Jack. What the hell could possibly happen?”   “I don’t know!” Dean exclaimed arms flailing as he whirled to face Sam. “Something must’ve! She hasn’t answered my last text and it’s been-” he paused pulling out his phone to brandish the screen. “Seven minutes!”   “Oh my god” Sam groaned tossing his head back to stare at the ceiling. “I can’t deal with this anymore.”   “What are you talking about? Aren’t you worried?” Dean asked gruffly.   “No Dean I’m not worried! There’s no reason to be worried!” Sam proclaimed.   “No reason? She could be dead!” Dean barked his face taking on an expression of disbelief.   Sam sighed as he leaned over the table raising his eyebrows. “Okay let me ask you this: why exactly do you think she’s dead?”   “Oh come on Sam!” Dean grumbled. “We don’t exactly live cookie cutter lives here you know. One minute she’s returning the shopping cart and the next she’s got a damn knife in her back!”   “Dean” Sam soothed. “You know as well as I do that’s a load of crap.”   “No” Dean argued shaking his head. “We don’t know that. We don’t know anything you know why?”   Before Sam could even respond Dean waved his phone around before dropping it on the table. “Because she won’t answer her damn phone!”   “Okay this is actually ridiculous” Sam declared. “How can you seriously not see what’s been happening to you?”   “Knock it off Sam” Dean muttered waving a hand dismissively as he began pacing again. “I’m fucking fine.”   “You’re fine” Sam repeated incredulously. “You’re friggin’ cursed Dean!”   “I’m not cursed!” shouted Dean. “Would you quit it with that crap?”   “Right because nothing’s been going on with you lately right?”   “Right!” Dean agreed with a huff.   “You haven’t been say I don’t know…. not sleeping? Feeling stir crazy? Getting paranoid?”  “Sam-”   “No I’m serious Dean! How can you not see this?”   “Because I’m fine!” Dean argued stalling his movements to gather his phone from the table.  After a few moments of silence Dean rolled his eyes and found himself once more walking the length of the library. “Okay maybe I’ve been feeling a little weird lately but I’ve just been tired - and you know what? I survived worse. So yeah I’m fine!”   “Right” Sam said sceptically. “And have you… noticed when it is that you feel… weird?”  “I don’t know!” Dean announced frustratedly.  “Dean” Sam chastised.   “What?”   “You’ve been feeling like this all week and it’s only getting worse. You’ve been like this since that witch cursed you - and don’t say she didn’t. Use your fucking head Dean! You’re cursed!”   Dean’s jaw clenched as he tried to remain calm taking a moment to formulate his response. “You’re insane” he finally declared.   “I think you’re the insane one” Sam contested. “You were cursed to yearn for something Dean. Only in this case… it’s someone.”   “What the hell are you talking about?”   “C’mon Dean!” Sam pleaded with a laugh. “The only time you get like this is when you’re more than ten feet away from Y/N.”   “You don’t know what you’re talking about” Dean muttered dismissively.   “You’ve checked your phone another five times since you picked it up.”   “So?” Dean questioned failing to resist the urge to check it once more. “I’m worried not cursed.”   “You’re worried because you’re cursed!” Sam argued.   “I’m worried because I lo-” Dean quickly fell silent as the words died on his tongue his brain firing into total overdrive as he laughed nervously. “I care that’s why I’m worried.”   Sam stared at his brother in total disbelief trying to find a way to make him realize what was going on- or most likely acknowledge what was going on.   Yet before the conversation could go any further the bunker door screeched open and the sound of your laughter fleeted down to greet Dean effectively turning his scowl into an affectionate grin.   “Hope you remembered my pie!” he called out marching to meet you at the foot of the stairs without so much as a glance back in Sam’s direction.   “When have I ever forgotten?” you asked feigning offence as you held out the bag which contained his pie.  “Well” he started taking the bag from you. “There was that time in Redford-”  “Hey!” you interrupted with a laugh. “I didn’t forget they were out!”  “See I still don’t believe you” he teased heading for the kitchen.   “Believe whatever you want Dean” you replied playfully.   “I’m still waiting for it you know. You should get me two next time” he joked though he was partly serious.   “Dean?” Sam’s voice tentatively called out.  “Yeah?” Dean replied hotly keeping his back to Sam as he went to grab a beer from the fridge.   “Who uh… who the hell are you talking to?” he asked carefully surveying the empty kitchen.   “Hilarious Sam” he said dryly shutting the fridge. “I’m talking to-”  His mouth ran dry as he turned around being met with just his brother who was staring with concern from the doorway.   “Y/N” Dean finished weakly.   “Her and Jack aren’t back yet Dean” Sam said carefully as though talking to a lost child.   “Yes they are. They got back she gave me my pie we came in here” Dean said fiercely his confidence shattering when he went to gesture at the pie he set down moments earlier and found it to be gone.   “Maybe you should sit down” Sam suggested not knowing what to do.   “I’m fine!” Dean shouted hovering over the counter. “I’m fine” he repeated moreso to himself than anything.   “Okay look how about I try calling Y/N okay?” Sam offered hesitantly walking further into the kitchen. “See when they’ll be back.”   “They are back!” Dean barked glaring at Sam. “She was just in here!”   Sam didn’t know what to say the fear and concern for his brother crashing down on him.   “She was just in here” Dean repeated shakily meeting Sam’s gaze with confusion.   “Dean” Sam started to say before the familiar tone of your ringtone came from Dean’s phone cutting through the air like a knife.   Dean pulled the phone from his pocket clearing his throat before answering. “Yeah?”   “Dean thank god” you cheered sighing in relief. “Listen we came out to a flat tire and I don’t have a spare because I forgot to fucking replace it and there are too many people around for Jack to you know try fixing it” you rambled anxiously. “Can you please come help?”   “You’re still at the store?” Dean clarified looking up at Sam with frightened eyes.   “Yeah we’re stuck in the parking lot” you told him breezily.   “Okay” he said swallowing thickly. “Alright I’ll be right there.”   “Thanks De!” you said happily ending the call.   Dean stood there for a few moments staring down at his unopened bottle of beer on the counter trying to gather his thoughts before finally lifting his gaze to Sam.  “I’ll uh…. I’ll be back” he told him not waiting for a response before trudging out of the kitchen.  You found yourself yet again rushing down the hall to Dean’s room his muffled yells waking you in the dead of night once more.   He uttered your name as you shut the door behind you and though it took you by surprise the very first time it happened - nearly two weeks ago now - it was something you’ve almost come to expect. It was killing you watching him go through this every night and not being able to fix it. You would sit with him find ways to gently rouse him from his terror filled slumber and comfort him when he woke but it never seemed like enough; he deserved more.  At first you didn’t think there was too much going on figuring his shift in behaviour was just due to his lack of sleep. You didn’t believe Sam when he talked to you about it; Dean may have been acting a little more strange than usual but it didn’t raise any red flags.  It wasn’t until the morning following your conversation that you noticed it cluing in and realising how different Dean had been; how long he’d been different. The excess text messages the increase in phone calls the insistence on you not going anywhere without him and his exuberant reactions to you getting back safe when you did go somewhere without him his constant questioning on where you were or where you’ve just been. Something else was going on and you could only think it really did come down to the witch you two encountered. So you and Sam called up Rowena getting her take on the situation and figuring out what to do.   Her words now echoed through your head as you perched yourself on the edge of his bed: “Magic isn’t simple. Some curses are anchored by the witch ending whenever they were to die. But others are more complex rooted not in the witch but the object of the curse itself not breaking until their purpose is carried out one way or another. Perhaps if you can figure out what it is Dean needs you can break the curse yourselves. If this carries on for any longer… I’m worried it will kill him.”   While you ran your fingers through his hair you decided right then and there that once he woke up you wouldn’t leave without confronting him about it. You knew it would likely start a fight and you felt a little guilty knowing you would all but interrogate him right after having another nightmare but all that guilt flew right out the window the second Dean startled himself awake the sight of his panic stricken face as he gasped for air nearly bringing you to tears; you’ve seen him like this too often as of late.   “It’s alright Dean” you soothed reaching out to him. “I’m right here everything’s fine.”   His gaze snapped to you unable to hide the confusion and terror still coursing through him despite the relief he felt. “Y/N?”   “Yeah De” you cooed running a hand across his shoulder blades. “We’re in your room everyone’s okay.”   He let out a shuddering breath hanging his head in his hands. “You’re okay” he whispered softly. “You’re okay.”   You sat quietly with him for a few more minutes patiently comforting him as best as you could while you thought of how to approach this conversation.   Clearing his throat Dean was the first to speak again as he rose from the bed. “Sorry I woke you again.”   The dejection and shame laced in his voice tore your heart to bits and you had to put up a good fight to keep your emotions in check. “You don’t need to apologize.”   “Yeah I do” he disagreed trudging to his sink in the corner.   “Dean please talk to me” you pleaded watching as he turned on the water.   You fell silent waiting for him to deny you and brush you off again. You waited for him to say something to do something but all he did was stare at the running water.   “Dean?” you asked cautiously slowly getting up from the bed yourself.   “I can’t save you” he muttered quietly his gaze on the faucet unyielding.   “What?” you asked curiously not knowing what he meant.   “I can never save you” he carried on. “You always just… slip away from me. Every time. It’s always the same.”   “What’s always the same?” you questioned moving closer towards him.   “I try” he muttered seemingly oblivious to your presence. “I run and I fight and I try but I can never reach you. I can never get to you.”  He seemed to snap out of his daze a little moving to splash water over his face before turning off the tap. “You keep dying. I keep watching you die. I can’t watch you die again Y/N. I can’t.”   “This is what your nightmares have been?” you wondered.   He fell silent again for a minute before meeting your gaze in the mirror. “Yeah.”   “It’s not real Dean” you told him softly.  “It’s real enough for me” he muttered turning to face you.   “And is this why you’ve been… acting differently towards me?” you asked hesitantly.   He averted his gaze hanging his head as he considered your question. “I guess” he said with a shrug. “Maybe yeah. I don’t know.”   “Dean” you scolded with a sigh plopping back down on the bed. “Why won’t you just tell me what’s going on?”   “Because everything’s fine!” he argued once again.   “I’m not stupid Dean!” you challenged. “I know you. I can see something’s eating you alive and it’s fucking killing me to witness it. So please tell me what the hell is going on.”   “It’s just nightmares” he lied crossing his arms against his chest.   “It’s more than nightmares!” you cried. “You’re withering away into nothing Dean! I mean let’s face it! You’re practically a zombie nowadays with how little sleep you get you’ve been acting like a puppy with separation anxiety and let’s not forget how completely erratic you’ve been.”  He glared at you jaw clenching as he decided whether or not to entertain this conversation. “Okay so maybe I haven’t slept lately” he admitted starkly. “But like I keep saying I’m fine.”   “Don’t you ever get tired of lying?” you sneered glaring up at him.   He rolled his eyes averting his gaze to anywhere else as he shook his head. “No but I’m getting tired of having this conversation all the time.”   “Well too bad!” you yelled abruptly standing from the bed. “Cause I’m tired of never having this conversation go anywhere! I’m tired of you brushing off the idea of you being cursed. I didn’t believe it at first either but what the hell else could it be Dean?”   “Oh come on!” he barked running a hand over his face. “I see Sam got his hooks into you.”   “Yeah he did. And you need to listen to us.”   “No I really don’t” he scoffed starting to head to the door.   “Even if it kills you?” you blurted out.   “It’s not gonna kill me!”   “God look at you Dean! It already is!” you argued marching closer to him. “How would you feel if the situation were reversed?”   He let out a sigh pausing with his hand on the doorknob before turning back to you. “What?”   “What if it were me going through all this instead of you? Would you let me get away with not even listening to you and Sam?”   He narrowed his eyes at you staring at you in silence for so long you expected him to turn away again. Instead he let out a deep breath as he took a seat gesturing for you to carry on. “Five minutes.”   You almost went to argue before you thought better of it knowing full well that if Dean never came around to the theory he would actually cut you off at the five minute mark. So you did your best to recount the entire situation for him reiterating what you Sam and Rowena had to say about it all in the hopes of getting through to him. By the time you finished you knew it was well over five minutes so you took Dean not interrupting you to be a good sign.   “Okay” he finally said with a small nod. “Well I listened. Can I go now?”   Your heart dropped to your stomach anger and fear bubbling inside of you as you exploded. “God you are unbelievable!”  “Well what do you want me to say?” he grumbled. “I just don’t believe that’s what’s going on.”   “How can you not believe it?” you asked incredulously. “It’s obvious!”   “Look I said I don’t believe it alright?” Dean snapped. “Why are you so hellbent on making this into some big fight? Just accept it.”   “No!” you seethed. “I can’t just accept the fact that this could kill you. Especially not when there’s a way we could end this.”   “No” he disagreed shaking his head. “You can’t fix this Y/N/N. You just can’t.”   “I can!” you cried. “Just tell me.”   “Tell you what?”   “You know what” you scolded.   “This is so fucking ridiculous.”   “Tell me anyway.”   “Why the hell do you care so much?” he questioned exasperatedly.   “Because I’m fucking terrified Dean!” you exclaimed. “I’ve watched you grow more restless and anxious every day since the night we finished that case. I’ve seen the life drain from you more and more as sleep became nearly impossible for you. And I know it’s nearly impossible for you because I have spent the last eleven nights sitting on that bed as you got terrorised by your own mind. I don’t care if you believe in this curse or not Dean because I do.”   Dean stood quietly absorbing what you said as the severity of the situation began to dawn on him.   “I mean don’t you get it?” you asked sadly cutting through the silence. “If something happens to you if I lose you… that’s not something I can come back from.”   Dean fell silent once more running a hand through his hair as he took a deep breath pacing around the room a little as he turned everything over in his head.   “I’m scared Dean” you reiterated softly. “Please just let us try to fix this.”   “There’s some things I should tell you then” he admitted quietly after a moment of silence taking a seat on the bed.   “About what’s been happening?” you asked hopefully.   He nodded staring down at his hands folded in his lap. “Yeah.”   “Okay” you said moving his desk chair to take a seat. “I’m listening.”   He took a bracing breath taking a few minutes to build the courage to speak. “Well you know I’ve been having nightmares.”   “I do” you agreed quietly.   “It’s always the same one” he admitted keeping his gaze cast downwards. “I could never figure out why. It didn’t make sense to me why it was always the same thing. So I finally talked to Sam about it and he had a pretty good theory. But you know me. I didn’t want to believe it because it came back down to that witch and this stupid fucking curse.”   He let out a bitter laugh pausing long enough for you to speak up. “What did he have to say about it?”   “I tried telling myself I was fine” he continued ignoring your question. “I was fine at first. At first it was just not sleeping well… but then other things started happening.”   “Other things like what?” you wondered quietly.   “Like my blood feeling like it’s on fucking fire” he muttered wiping at his face. “And my skin feeling like it-… like it’s being peeled off my goddamn bones and my face feeling like it’s melting… and how I get this- this bubble inside my chest that feels like it’s either gonna burst or suffocate me and how it all only happens-” he stopped in his rambling taking a deep breath before chuckling in disbelief. “God it only happens when you’re not around Y/N.”   “I-… what do you mean?” you asked breathlessly.   “Oh come on Y/N” he said bitterly. “I know you’ve noticed. I text you more I’m almost always calling you. I just- I get this… this unwavering panic inside me when you’re not around. I keep-… I swear to god I see you everywhere when you’re gone. I catch sight of you across the street I smell your stupid shampoo when I’m alone I hear your voice when no one’s there. I had an entire conversation with you and you weren’t even there” he carried on shaking his head as he briskly wiped away an angry tear. “God I’m going fucking crazy” he added with a manic chuckle.   “You’re not crazy Dean” you said gently.   “That night” he started staring at the wall across from him. “She was trying to get back someone she lost… someone she loved.”   “Right” you agreed.   “They used to drown them people they accused of being witches” he continued slowly.   “Yeah it was pretty common. Sink and you were innocent. Float and you were guilty” you pitched in. “But… what does that have to do with this?”  “I think they were innocent” he said simply. “Whoever she lost… I think that’s how she lost them.”   “Why do you think that?” you asked curiously.   Dean cleared his throat staring pensively at his hands once more. “The nightmares. It’s always… you always drown. I keep-… I can never save you.”   “I don’t get-” you started to say before he cut you off.   “It’s how she lost who she loves Y/N” he said curtly. “It makes sense for me to see the one I love go the same way.”   “I-… what?” you asked too stunned to think of anything else to say.   “The dreams the hallucinations the- the way I’ve been feeling… I didn’t want to admit it I still don’t but I can’t… I mean I can only ignore it for so long right?” he said scoffing quietly. “Especially with you and Sam breathing down my neck about it.”   “Ignore what Dean?” you asked breathlessly your heart hammering in your chest.   “You” he muttered. “They way I feel about you. The way I’ve always felt about you.”   You didn’t dare respond his words ringing in your ears as he fell silent each of you lost in your own thoughts for a while.   “I’ve always known that I love you Y/N/N” he carried on slowly meeting your gaze with glistening eyes. “But this… this curse this whatever it is. God it’s just made it all so much worse and I knew. I knew it was you that my entire being was screaming out for but I couldn’t… I couldn’t admit it.”   “Why not?” you asked shakily feeling your tears starting to build.   “How could I put that on you?” he asked a few rogue tears slipping down his face. “You said it yourself this thing is killing me. It’s gonna kill me unless I get what I want and given that that’s you I’m calling it game over.”   “No Dean it’s not” you denied with a sniffle cutting through your own stray tears. “You should’ve told me.”   “Yeah well” he grumbled shrugging lightly as he looked back at his hands. “I told you now.”   “Dean” you sighed wiping your face as you stood from your seat. “Do you trust me?” you asked walking towards him.  “Of course I do” he said quickly almost offended by the question.   “Okay well I’ll need you to trust me on this” you replied stopping just in front of where he sat.   “Okay” he said with a huff.   “You gotta look at me though” you said laughing softly.   Sighing dejectedly he slowly lifted his head to meet your gaze a ghost of a smile dancing on his lips as he looked at you.   You smiled softly at him gently taking his face in your hands before wordlessly bringing your lips down to meet his. At first neither of you really knew what was happening and just when you thought to pull away you felt his lips moving against your own. His hands gripped your waist to hold you in place a moment longer before you each pulled away staring silently at each other as you processed what just happened.   “What uh… what was that for?” Dean finally asked.   “Well it was either that or slapping some sense into you” you said playfully. “Which I almost think you still deserve because I can’t believe you honestly think I don’t love you back.”   “What?” he asked his grip on your waist loosening in shock before tightening once more.   “You’ve had me since the day we met Dean” you told him softly carding your fingers through his hair.   “You actually…” he trailed off quietly trying to focus his thoughts. “You actually love me of all people?”   “Yeah” you said quietly. “I do.”   “So I- well I guess I could’ve saved a lot of trouble if I really did just tell you huh?” he asked jokingly laughing tightly.   “I’ll give you hell for it tomorrow” you teased half serious. “For now how about we try getting you back to sleep?”   “Actually” he said eyes sparkling with mischief. “I have a better idea involving this bed.”   You couldn’t help but snort a laugh grinning fondly at him. “Oh really?”   He grinned back laughing with you before taking on a more sombre tone. “Do you trust me?”   “Always” you said honestly.   “Good” he replied with a grin laughing heartily at the shriek you let out when he tossed you on the bed.   He stared down at you a look you’ve never seen before painted on his face. “What?” you asked giggling nervously.  “I love you” he said earnestly brushing a lock of hair away from your face.   “I love you too” you replied shyly grinning softly.   He matched your grin drinking you in a moment longer before crashing his lips upon yours once more.   When Dean woke the next morning it didn’t take long for a grin to spread across his face as he quickly realized two things.   The first thing being that you the love of his life still remained tangled up in both his arms and the sheets sleeping peacefully atop his chest.   The second being that for the first time in a total of thirteen days he was able to sleep without being haunted by his nightmares.   He felt you stir and his grin widened as you nestled in closer tightening your grip on him as you slept. He planted a kiss against your temple pulling you in close as he blissfully settled in for another peaceful rest.   Maybe witches aren’t so bad.  tagging: @roseblue373   let me know if you’d like to be tagged!,2024-07-08 01:58:42 GMT

I don’t even think that shipping real people is inherently wrong especially because there are a lot of celebrities of the younger generations who are fine with it. And even encourage it in some cases!   AS LONG AS YOU REMEMBER IT’S A FANTASY  It’s when fans get upset when two real people aren’t together get mad that they have significant others outside the fandom or start coming up with “evidence” that I have a problem with it  I’m cool with fantasies but some of y&#x27;all cannot handle shipping real people without being creeps so you gotta just stop.,2024-07-08 03:58:59 GMT

10,Supernatural,['teen wolf'  'spn x teen wolf'  'dean winchester'  'stiles stilinski'  'supernatural x teen wolf'  'spn'  'lapse in thoughts'],lapseinart,Thinking about a SPN x Teen Wolf xover as I am wont to do like a Noah Stilinski is Dean Winchester type of thing. Claudia is basically Lisa Braeden and Stiles is Ben except he doesn’t remember the changelings and Stiles is Dean’s bio son. And I have no idea where to go with that idea in general and just started worldbuilding instead of coming up with a plot as I am also wont to do.   Anyway putting a rant about diff kind of Hunters and maybe class divisions under the cut  &lt;!-- more --&gt; So I imagine long established families like the Argents and maybe even the Campbells with more money and resources versus people like the Winchesters and the Harvelles and the type of Hunters you see more in Supernatural. There’s definitely some resentment from the Hunters that are more motivated by revenge than the ones motivated by duty and familial obligation because it often comes with class differences. And when Gerard is recruiting Hunters he pulls more from the independent Hunters than Hunting Families offering more knowledge and money. But even the Argents have heard of the Winchesters.   Hunting Families are more likely to specialize or have one kind of monster they’re known to Hunt. But they are also more stationary and more willing to just kill whatever they find because they have larger repositories of knowledge. Independent Hunters might therefore hyper specialize since they are more mobile.   The Winchester brothers became rather infamous because of their willingness to fight demons. I mean early on in SPN season 1 Dean talks about how demons are out of their wheelhouse or whatever metaphor was used. Bobby sort of specializes in demons because his wife was possessed but I imagine most Hunters especially independent ones were either unwilling or unable to fight demons. Might also be true of Hunting Families they just don’t want to because of high risks. Especially since for a long time default was exorcisig demons which meant they could come back and take revenge on the whole family. Although maybe that was the Campbell’s specialization?? But like for most Hunting Families I imagine they did not usually fight demons. Maybe why Chris Argent was more unprepared for a Nogitsune.   During the apocalypse I imagine that Hunting Families mainly focused on protecting their immediate area probably focusing more on warding them out that killing demons and/or outright fighting them. Independent Hunters were more likely to fight demons and therefore those that survived had a lot more knowledge on demon tactics than the Hunting Families. For the first time they had the lever up on the info against Hunting Families.   This plus the apocalypse could also be what prompted Gerard Argent to 1.) have such extreme views that led to his extreme dehumanization of “monsters” 2.) start outsourcing to independent Hunters for help more who are also more likely to share these extreme views and not follow the Code.,2024-07-08 05:29:09 GMT

Love or seal? Dean Winchester x Fem!reader  Summary: An avenging spirit is killing married couples so the Winchesters think it’s a good idea to use you to pretend to be one and take down the ghost. But the act becomes all too real before you know it.  Words: 18k.  Warnings &amp; Tags: mentions of murder death violence. so much teasing. a little of angst with happy ending. dean from the early seasons but soft and chaotic (a bit simp). sam being cupid and forgotten lol.english isn’t my first language (sorry for my mistakes be kind please).    Note: I’ve always been a Dean girl and I’m so excited about this. I love the concept of “Frenemies to Lovers” with its more playful and cutie version from the earlier seasons I hope I described it well.  This is my second time ever writing here i’m still new.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; You took another look in the mirror and walked a few laps around the dingy motel room trying to swallow the act. It seemed ironic to wear such a fancy dress and high heels in a place like this but it was all so you could solve the case and prevent more deaths. After all it was your job to catch the ghosts and put them to rest.  It had been a long time since you’d been out on a date or worn anything other than your usual jeans and leather jacket. Buying yourself a cute dress and wedding rings with one of your fake cards had been entertaining the closest thing to a normal life you’d had in years.  “Come in I need help with the zipper on my dress.” You said after hearing a couple of knocks on your door.  You were still standing in front of the bathroom mirror waiting for Sam to show up to help you so the two of you could leave soon for the restaurant where you both had reserved a table. The strange thing was that the cold hands you felt running down your back and zipping you up were not his but those of his older brother.  “What are you doing here? Where is Sam?” You turned around to look at Dean once your dress was closed. It was then that you noticed he was wearing a suit and the ring.  “In the room.” He replied moving closer to you so he could look at himself in the mirror and adjusting his tie with difficulty he was not used to wearing one at all and felt suffocated.  “Why are you dressed like that?” You asked him after looking him over from head to toe and inevitably biting your lower lip. He looked good all dressed up and dapper you could even smell the scent of cologne wafting off him.   “I’ll be your husband for tonight.” Dean smiled at you.  You frowned when you heard that the younger Winchester would no longer be your fake husband because that was not what you had all agreed upon. Sam had always been more husband material and you trusted him enough to have some physical contact if necessary. On the other hand you saw Dean as someone who was far from the prototypical perfect partner and you could barely talk to him without arguing about your differences never having touched him except for sparring practice or taking away the gun he kept stealing from you. You couldn’t deny that both brothers were attractive but they were almost equally far from meaning anything romantic to you.  “We flipped a coin and I got the job.” He added to the explanation noticing the confusion on your face.  Finally you nodded realizing that once again they had not been able to reach an agreement and had had to put luck in the middle for the choice of roles. You didn’t mind going with Dean you had already been on several hunts with him and trusted his skills but having to impersonate his wife was weird.  “Can you…?” He tried to ask you pointing at his tie and all the trouble it caused him.  You let out a small laugh at seeing him so confused over a simple tie and went over to him to take it off. You had to tie it all over again because of how badly he had done it before.  “This looks very wife.” He commented as he saw the delicacy with which you were trying to fix his mess.  “I hope the spirit feels the same and is looking forward to slaughtering us.” You replied taking a step away from him as you finished.  You two said a quick goodbye to Sam and then hopped into the Impala which took you to a shiny restaurant near the road where the ghost appeared.  “Don’t embarrass me please.” You said to him as soon as you both sat down at the table and placed your order.  “How could I darling?” He smiled innocently at you and took your hand on the table caressing the ring on your finger.  You didn’t say anything just smiled back and kept your thoughts to yourself. You couldn’t believe he actually called you that sounding almost like a husband even though you knew it was because of the acting it gave you a funny feeling in your stomach. The most you’d gotten from Dean Winchester in all the years you’d known him was a “good job” and a strange smile followed by a lot of questions about your careless decisions. You alone were far enough away from marriage let alone someone like him.  “You look very handsome tonight.” You told him as you saw he was drinking water causing him to almost spit it out in surprise.  Usually you never complimented him barely looked him in the eye talked about anything other than hunting or even laughed at his jokes. It seemed that his presence didn’t matter much to you because your interests were more aligned with Sam’s and you got along better with him. That bothered Dean a lot he hated being so invisible in your eyes.  Now however you didn’t take your eyes off him and even gave him compliments that left him speechless to continue the performance.   “At least the food is good.” You said absentmindedly as the waiter brought the plates.  “And the company?”  You looked into his eyes trying to understand if he was playing with you or if he was really hurt by your lack of emotion. The strange thing was that you didn’t know if it was one or the other his greenish gaze was a mystery.  “The best company of course.” You gave him a smile and picked up your glass of wine to make a small toast.  “How affectionate you are now.”  “Yes I feel almost as if today is the last day of my life.” You said with irony.   Dinner went off without a hitch in a quiet and strangely pleasant atmosphere. You couldn’t help but be surprised by Dean’s friendliness it was the first time you had a civilized conversation with him. The first time he held your hand and you noticed how green his eyes were.   Suddenly everything he said silly or not made you smile. The only rational thing to do was to attribute it to the glass of wine he had decided to drink. In general you didn’t allow yourself to drink alcohol let alone in the middle of a hunt. But now for some reason you thought it would help your nerves and relax you a bit.  “Where did you leave the car?” You asked once they left the site and the time to travel the road of death was approaching.   “In the corner over there…I hope.” He answered without really being sure. For him it had all happened so fast when you two arrived.  “My feet hurt. Don’t play with me now.” You said hating the high heels you were wearing.  At that moment the hunter stopped and motioned for you to sit on the bench by the exit. Unsure you obeyed and frowned as he knelt down to gently remove your shoes.  “Happy now?” He asked he asked holding your heels in his hands.  “I can’t walk barefoot.” You claimed putting on a fake sad face and lowering your gaze to his arms.  Dean shook his head instantly.  “No don’t even think that I’ll carry you.” He warned confidently folding his arms.  A few minutes later he was silently leading you to the car snorting at every opportunity to give in so easily to your wishes.  “This looks very husband.” You pointed out with a smile and a teasing tone.  “I would offer you to the spirit right now.” He replied looking at you with narrowed eyes.  “How lovely you are my dear.”  The two finally got into the car and headed for the exit. Dean had received a message from his brother telling him that he had found the name of the ghost woman and her grave with her husband who was the cause of all his resentment against happily married couples and to top it off he was buried on top of her.  “Sam is going to burn the grave and everything will be fine.” He said trying to comfort you as he saw the concern on your face. “Maybe the woman doesn’t want to kill anyone today.”  “You have too much faith in a murderous spirit.” You sighed and tried to remove the ring from your finger but it stuck. “And you should take the ring off.”  “Are we getting divorced so soon?” He replied in a joking tone with his eyes on the road.  You looked at him seriously this was no time for jokes because everything was going wrong. If Sam didn’t dig up those bones soon they were probably going to kill you both and the plan was going to fail completely. It was supposed to be easy and you were terrified that it wasn’t anymore.  “Come on don’t be like that. You were laughing so hard with me.” He smiled at you.  Before you could respond a pale woman in a blood-stained wedding dress appeared in the back seat. You could barely say Dean’s name when the ghost’s hand came around your neck and began to choke you. After a few moments you couldn’t even breathe and everything became a blur.  You didn’t want to die at least not at that moment. Not without having lived a life as good as the night before everything went to hell. You still had too many things to do to go like that let alone in front of him you couldn’t let that happen.  “Don’t move.” The hunter said to you before drawing his gun and disputing you to the back seat.

10,Supernatural,['teen wolf'  'spn x teen wolf'  'dean winchester'  'stiles stilinski'  'supernatural x teen wolf'  'spn'  'lapse in thoughts'],lapseinart,Thinking about a SPN x Teen Wolf xover as I am wont to do like a Noah Stilinski is Dean Winchester type of thing. Claudia is basically Lisa Braeden and Stiles is Ben except he doesn’t remember the changelings and Stiles is Dean’s bio son. And I have no idea where to go with that idea in general and just started worldbuilding instead of coming up with a plot as I am also wont to do.   Anyway putting a rant about diff kind of Hunters and maybe class divisions under the cut  &lt;!-- more --&gt; So I imagine long established families like the Argents and maybe even the Campbells with more money and resources versus people like the Winchesters and the Harvelles and the type of Hunters you see more in Supernatural. There’s definitely some resentment from the Hunters that are more motivated by revenge than the ones motivated by duty and familial obligation because it often comes with class differences. And when Gerard is recruiting Hunters he pulls more from the independent Hunters than Hunting Families offering more knowledge and money. But even the Argents have heard of the Winchesters.   Hunting Families are more likely to specialize or have one kind of monster they’re known to Hunt. But they are also more stationary and more willing to just kill whatever they find because they have larger repositories of knowledge. Independent Hunters might therefore hyper specialize since they are more mobile.   The Winchester brothers became rather infamous because of their willingness to fight demons. I mean early on in SPN season 1 Dean talks about how demons are out of their wheelhouse or whatever metaphor was used. Bobby sort of specializes in demons because his wife was possessed but I imagine most Hunters especially independent ones were either unwilling or unable to fight demons. Might also be true of Hunting Families they just don’t want to because of high risks. Especially since for a long time default was exorcisig demons which meant they could come back and take revenge on the whole family. Although maybe that was the Campbell’s specialization?? But like for most Hunting Families I imagine they did not usually fight demons. Maybe why Chris Argent was more unprepared for a Nogitsune.   During the apocalypse I imagine that Hunting Families mainly focused on protecting their immediate area probably focusing more on warding them out that killing demons and/or outright fighting them. Independent Hunters were more likely to fight demons and therefore those that survived had a lot more knowledge on demon tactics than the Hunting Families. For the first time they had the lever up on the info against Hunting Families.   This plus the apocalypse could also be what prompted Gerard Argent to 1.) have such extreme views that led to his extreme dehumanization of “monsters” 2.) start outsourcing to independent Hunters for help more who are also more likely to share these extreme views and not follow the Code.,2024-07-08 05:29:09 GMT

Love or seal? Dean Winchester x Fem!reader  Summary: An avenging spirit is killing married couples so the Winchesters think it’s a good idea to use you to pretend to be one and take down the ghost. But the act becomes all too real before you know it.  Words: 18k.  Warnings &amp; Tags: mentions of murder death violence. so much teasing. a little of angst with happy ending. dean from the early seasons but soft and chaotic (a bit simp). sam being cupid and forgotten lol.english isn’t my first language (sorry for my mistakes be kind please).    Note: I’ve always been a Dean girl and I’m so excited about this. I love the concept of “Frenemies to Lovers” with its more playful and cutie version from the earlier seasons I hope I described it well.  This is my second time ever writing here i’m still new.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; You took another look in the mirror and walked a few laps around the dingy motel room trying to swallow the act. It seemed ironic to wear such a fancy dress and high heels in a place like this but it was all so you could solve the case and prevent more deaths. After all it was your job to catch the ghosts and put them to rest.  It had been a long time since you’d been out on a date or worn anything other than your usual jeans and leather jacket. Buying yourself a cute dress and wedding rings with one of your fake cards had been entertaining the closest thing to a normal life you’d had in years.  “Come in I need help with the zipper on my dress.” You said after hearing a couple of knocks on your door.  You were still standing in front of the bathroom mirror waiting for Sam to show up to help you so the two of you could leave soon for the restaurant where you both had reserved a table. The strange thing was that the cold hands you felt running down your back and zipping you up were not his but those of his older brother.  “What are you doing here? Where is Sam?” You turned around to look at Dean once your dress was closed. It was then that you noticed he was wearing a suit and the ring.  “In the room.” He replied moving closer to you so he could look at himself in the mirror and adjusting his tie with difficulty he was not used to wearing one at all and felt suffocated.  “Why are you dressed like that?” You asked him after looking him over from head to toe and inevitably biting your lower lip. He looked good all dressed up and dapper you could even smell the scent of cologne wafting off him.   “I’ll be your husband for tonight.” Dean smiled at you.  You frowned when you heard that the younger Winchester would no longer be your fake husband because that was not what you had all agreed upon. Sam had always been more husband material and you trusted him enough to have some physical contact if necessary. On the other hand you saw Dean as someone who was far from the prototypical perfect partner and you could barely talk to him without arguing about your differences never having touched him except for sparring practice or taking away the gun he kept stealing from you. You couldn’t deny that both brothers were attractive but they were almost equally far from meaning anything romantic to you.  “We flipped a coin and I got the job.” He added to the explanation noticing the confusion on your face.  Finally you nodded realizing that once again they had not been able to reach an agreement and had had to put luck in the middle for the choice of roles. You didn’t mind going with Dean you had already been on several hunts with him and trusted his skills but having to impersonate his wife was weird.  “Can you…?” He tried to ask you pointing at his tie and all the trouble it caused him.  You let out a small laugh at seeing him so confused over a simple tie and went over to him to take it off. You had to tie it all over again because of how badly he had done it before.  “This looks very wife.” He commented as he saw the delicacy with which you were trying to fix his mess.  “I hope the spirit feels the same and is looking forward to slaughtering us.” You replied taking a step away from him as you finished.  You two said a quick goodbye to Sam and then hopped into the Impala which took you to a shiny restaurant near the road where the ghost appeared.  “Don’t embarrass me please.” You said to him as soon as you both sat down at the table and placed your order.  “How could I darling?” He smiled innocently at you and took your hand on the table caressing the ring on your finger.  You didn’t say anything just smiled back and kept your thoughts to yourself. You couldn’t believe he actually called you that sounding almost like a husband even though you knew it was because of the acting it gave you a funny feeling in your stomach. The most you’d gotten from Dean Winchester in all the years you’d known him was a “good job” and a strange smile followed by a lot of questions about your careless decisions. You alone were far enough away from marriage let alone someone like him.  “You look very handsome tonight.” You told him as you saw he was drinking water causing him to almost spit it out in surprise.  Usually you never complimented him barely looked him in the eye talked about anything other than hunting or even laughed at his jokes. It seemed that his presence didn’t matter much to you because your interests were more aligned with Sam’s and you got along better with him. That bothered Dean a lot he hated being so invisible in your eyes.  Now however you didn’t take your eyes off him and even gave him compliments that left him speechless to continue the performance.   “At least the food is good.” You said absentmindedly as the waiter brought the plates.  “And the company?”  You looked into his eyes trying to understand if he was playing with you or if he was really hurt by your lack of emotion. The strange thing was that you didn’t know if it was one or the other his greenish gaze was a mystery.  “The best company of course.” You gave him a smile and picked up your glass of wine to make a small toast.  “How affectionate you are now.”  “Yes I feel almost as if today is the last day of my life.” You said with irony.   Dinner went off without a hitch in a quiet and strangely pleasant atmosphere. You couldn’t help but be surprised by Dean’s friendliness it was the first time you had a civilized conversation with him. The first time he held your hand and you noticed how green his eyes were.   Suddenly everything he said silly or not made you smile. The only rational thing to do was to attribute it to the glass of wine he had decided to drink. In general you didn’t allow yourself to drink alcohol let alone in the middle of a hunt. But now for some reason you thought it would help your nerves and relax you a bit.  “Where did you leave the car?” You asked once they left the site and the time to travel the road of death was approaching.   “In the corner over there…I hope.” He answered without really being sure. For him it had all happened so fast when you two arrived.  “My feet hurt. Don’t play with me now.” You said hating the high heels you were wearing.  At that moment the hunter stopped and motioned for you to sit on the bench by the exit. Unsure you obeyed and frowned as he knelt down to gently remove your shoes.  “Happy now?” He asked he asked holding your heels in his hands.  “I can’t walk barefoot.” You claimed putting on a fake sad face and lowering your gaze to his arms.  Dean shook his head instantly.  “No don’t even think that I’ll carry you.” He warned confidently folding his arms.  A few minutes later he was silently leading you to the car snorting at every opportunity to give in so easily to your wishes.  “This looks very husband.” You pointed out with a smile and a teasing tone.  “I would offer you to the spirit right now.” He replied looking at you with narrowed eyes.  “How lovely you are my dear.”  The two finally got into the car and headed for the exit. Dean had received a message from his brother telling him that he had found the name of the ghost woman and her grave with her husband who was the cause of all his resentment against happily married couples and to top it off he was buried on top of her.  “Sam is going to burn the grave and everything will be fine.” He said trying to comfort you as he saw the concern on your face. “Maybe the woman doesn’t want to kill anyone today.”  “You have too much faith in a murderous spirit.” You sighed and tried to remove the ring from your finger but it stuck. “And you should take the ring off.”  “Are we getting divorced so soon?” He replied in a joking tone with his eyes on the road.  You looked at him seriously this was no time for jokes because everything was going wrong. If Sam didn’t dig up those bones soon they were probably going to kill you both and the plan was going to fail completely. It was supposed to be easy and you were terrified that it wasn’t anymore.  “Come on don’t be like that. You were laughing so hard with me.” He smiled at you.  Before you could respond a pale woman in a blood-stained wedding dress appeared in the back seat. You could barely say Dean’s name when the ghost’s hand came around your neck and began to choke you. After a few moments you couldn’t even breathe and everything became a blur.  You didn’t want to die at least not at that moment. Not without having lived a life as good as the night before everything went to hell. You still had too many things to do to go like that let alone in front of him you couldn’t let that happen.  “Don’t move.” The hunter said to you before drawing his gun and disputing you to the back seat.  The ghost disappeared for a few seconds and then reappeared just ahead of the road. A braking maneuver as the woman was beginning to burn in front of the two of you almost made you jump out of your seat.   Sam had succeeded.  “Are you okay?” Dean asks looking at you with concern.  “Yeah.” You said still trying to catch your breath and process everything that had happened.   “And my thanks for saving you and not letting death part us?”  At any other time you would have simply made a sarcastic comment and emphasized that it was all thanks to her brother. However the recent experience had changed something in you and made you kiss his cheek.  Before you could completely pull your face away from his he put his hand on your cheek and pulled you close.

10,Supernatural,['teen wolf'  'spn x teen wolf'  'dean winchester'  'stiles stilinski'  'supernatural x teen wolf'  'spn'  'lapse in thoughts'],lapseinart,Thinking about a SPN x Teen Wolf xover as I am wont to do like a Noah Stilinski is Dean Winchester type of thing. Claudia is basically Lisa Braeden and Stiles is Ben except he doesn’t remember the changelings and Stiles is Dean’s bio son. And I have no idea where to go with that idea in general and just started worldbuilding instead of coming up with a plot as I am also wont to do.   Anyway putting a rant about diff kind of Hunters and maybe class divisions under the cut  &lt;!-- more --&gt; So I imagine long established families like the Argents and maybe even the Campbells with more money and resources versus people like the Winchesters and the Harvelles and the type of Hunters you see more in Supernatural. There’s definitely some resentment from the Hunters that are more motivated by revenge than the ones motivated by duty and familial obligation because it often comes with class differences. And when Gerard is recruiting Hunters he pulls more from the independent Hunters than Hunting Families offering more knowledge and money. But even the Argents have heard of the Winchesters.   Hunting Families are more likely to specialize or have one kind of monster they’re known to Hunt. But they are also more stationary and more willing to just kill whatever they find because they have larger repositories of knowledge. Independent Hunters might therefore hyper specialize since they are more mobile.   The Winchester brothers became rather infamous because of their willingness to fight demons. I mean early on in SPN season 1 Dean talks about how demons are out of their wheelhouse or whatever metaphor was used. Bobby sort of specializes in demons because his wife was possessed but I imagine most Hunters especially independent ones were either unwilling or unable to fight demons. Might also be true of Hunting Families they just don’t want to because of high risks. Especially since for a long time default was exorcisig demons which meant they could come back and take revenge on the whole family. Although maybe that was the Campbell’s specialization?? But like for most Hunting Families I imagine they did not usually fight demons. Maybe why Chris Argent was more unprepared for a Nogitsune.   During the apocalypse I imagine that Hunting Families mainly focused on protecting their immediate area probably focusing more on warding them out that killing demons and/or outright fighting them. Independent Hunters were more likely to fight demons and therefore those that survived had a lot more knowledge on demon tactics than the Hunting Families. For the first time they had the lever up on the info against Hunting Families.   This plus the apocalypse could also be what prompted Gerard Argent to 1.) have such extreme views that led to his extreme dehumanization of “monsters” 2.) start outsourcing to independent Hunters for help more who are also more likely to share these extreme views and not follow the Code.,2024-07-08 05:29:09 GMT

No ID -CH 4 - Rougarous Vampires and Mermaids  Summary: You’re a writer but in your free time you volunteer at the local hospital and that’s how you met him. A very beautiful man found alone and dying in an abandoned warehouse. After being asked to sit with him and see if your presence causes him to wake or at least respond you do but that choice may change you in ways you could never have imagined.   Characters: Dean Winchester Sam Winchester Bobby Singer Marla (OFC) You/Reader  Warnings: hospital stay mentions of death both in the hospital setting and the reader’s past show level violence/ gore angst fluff. Expect more/ new warnings as each chapter requires.   Chapter Warnings: reader learns that Bobby never told her the full truth demons try to smoke Dean and reader out of her house   A/N: this whole fic came from this one image  Word Count: 1337  Divider and Cover Image by me  Masterlist | Series Masterlist  “Only way to stop a Rougarou is to light them on fire so either you or some hunter put him down?”  “How did you know that?”  “I told you that was a monster and the man who saved you was probably a hunter maybe even the guy you said came and sat with you in the hospital.”  “Well why didn’t he tell me the truth then?”  “How old were you?”  &lt;!-- more --&gt; “Just shy of my fifteenth birthday” I answered.  “He might have been trying to save you from being permanently scarred.”  “What was his name?”  “No clue” I replied “I was in and out of consciousness for a couple days. By the time I fully woke up whoever saved me was long gone. The only person I had left was some grumpy old dude who sat with me a few days and then had to leave town.”  “What was his name?”  “Bobby” I started to answer but was rudely cut off.  “Bobby? Bobby Singer was the volunteer?”  “How do you know his last name?”  “He’s my” Dean paused “he’s like a father to me.”  “So you know where he lives?” I asked hopefully.  “Yeah in fact can you help me get out of here? If you do I’ll take you to him.”  Distrust began seeping back in and I asked “what’s the thing Bobby’s known for?”  Dean gaped at me for a moment “killing demons and wearing trucker caps.”  I just sat there thinking ‘did this dude just say Bobby kills demons?!”  “Yes sweetheart you heard me right. Bobby Singer started as a demon hunter and now he hunts all manner of evil.”  “Ok so if demons and Rougarous are real what about like vampires and mermaids?”  “I’ve never seen a mermaid – yet so don’t rule that one out but yeah vamps are real so are werewolves shapeshifters anything that’s nasty and haunts the dark corners.”  “Bigfoot?”  “Nope he’s not real.”  “You seem certain.”  “Trust me sweetheart. I know a thing or two.”  I wasn’t sure what to think sure Bobby had been secretive and told me to protect my apartment – a practice I still kept all these years later but was he really some monster hunting badass?  A doctor walked in to check Dean but as I stepped out of the room I heard him whisper “Dean Winchester – tearing you apart is going to make my damn day.”  Somehow while they were struggling I had the wherewithal to grab Dean’s boots and my bag and scoot out the door soon to be joined by Dean limping along by my side. We made it to a supply closet and Dean grabbed something and started drawing on the ceiling with it. He had me press my back against the far corner of the closet and somehow when the doctor stepped through the threshold he couldn’t move.  Dean began chanting in Latin – ‘is that an exorcism?’ I wondered. ‘I gotta remember this so I can write a book!’  Once the black cloud of smoke cleared the man’s body Dean grabbed him pulled on his scrubs and we took off.  “Take me to your house so I can get my gear and get the eff outta here.”  “I kinda don’t want you at my house” I admitted.  “I don’t wanna do that either but this is life and death so let’s go” he implored me. “I need my weapons from the trunk.”  “Fine” I grumbled as we made our way to my car. “You better not kill me. I have friends who will help prosecute you.”  “I’m trying to save you not kill you” he assured.  As we rushed into the house he began barking orders “tell me where your laundry is and get your stuff packed. We gotta hide you for a few days.”  “You can’t just march in my house and start bossing me around!”  “The hell I can’t!” he barked as he began undressing “we need to change clothes and get the heck out of here!”  “What?! NO!”  “You can either do as you’re told or I can make you” he threatened.  “You’re turning out to be quite insufferable!” I shouted as I walked toward my room. “The laundry is at the back of the kitchen.”  Ten minutes later I met him in the kitchen with two bags – one my backpack with my laptop and some work essentials and the other was a duffel of clothing I’d attempted to put a variety of things in the bag so I was prepared for everything – I’d find out later that I wasn’t ready for any of this.  “Two bags?”  “Yeah I need my gear and some clothes. Gah you’re such a man” I rolled my eyes at his implication that I was bringing too much stuff.  “Good do you have a gun?”  I huffed “do I look like a girl with a gun? And furthermore you have plenty in that car of yours.”  “Speaking of my Baby where is she?”  “Baby?” I giggled “ok so the word baby meant the car and not a baby?”  “I don’t have a baby” he assured “now let’s go before something bad happens.”  “I wanna grab one thing – in case we end up not coming back for a while” the last part of my sentence came out quieter because I was kind of hoping I didn’t have to leave my home for good. I had a great thing going here – yet there was this pull to follow this man no matter the cost so I grabbed my tiny photo album and stuffed it in my bag with my laptop.  “Do you have first aid stuff?” he asked and I realized his stitches on the side must have popped.  “I’ll grab it” as I came back with every possible first aid item I owned he asked a question that terrified me.  “Do you smell smoke?”  We got out of the house and into the garage in time to see flames and smoke coming from the back of the house.  “Get in the car now!” he roared.  “You’re bleeding” I attempted to argue.  “Now!”  I all but dove into the car and we backed straight through the garage door before peeling down the street.  “You broke my door!”  “I’ll buy you a new one” he chuckled darkly and I once again wondered why I had just followed this man so blindly.  “You need your side patched up.”  “I’ll live.”  I crossed my arms and pouted a bit but I couldn’t stay mad at him – a fact I was beginning to hate.  “Where are we going?”  “Bobby’s” he replied curtly.  Four hours later I was being shaken awake “I’m hungry and we need fuel.”  “You need patched up” I murmured.  “It stopped bleeding but yeah” he admitted “I do need bandaged up.”  A few minutes later we pulled into a little clearing and Dean dragged himself from the car.  I scurried out my side to meet him at the trunk and clean his side up. We chatted as I checked the damage – every brush of my fingertips against his skin sent lightening bolts through my body ‘why was I reacting like this?’  “It looks like two stitches are broken” I told him “I think we can keep the bleeding down with this” I pulled some liquid bandage out and painted a bit on the spot between the stitches making sure to keep it on his skin only and not to make contact with the stitches themselves.  He winced “I know that probably stings but you’ll be better off.”  “Yeah yeah whatever just get it done.”  “So Bobby’s huh?” I asked as we made our way back onto the road.  “Yep.”  “Where is that?”  “Sioux Falls” he answered.  “Really?”  “Yeah where’d you think he lived?”  “No clue. I didn’t think he actually had a home” I chuckled. “We don’t exactly do Sunday dinner but he’s the one person I could rely on since I was 15” I explained “So I keep his contact info in my phone.”  SPN Fam:  @all-alone-he-turns-to-stone | @lyarr24    @dean-winchester-is-a-warrior | @nancymcl    @deans-baby-momma     @squirrelnotsam | @leigh70 | @impalaslytherin  @mishkatelwarriorgoddess | @deans-spinster-witch     @perpetualabsurdity | @bumbleb10 | @mrswhozeewhatsis | @123passwort     @roseblue373 | @jackles010378 | @hobby27  Mr. Green-eyes Tags:  @akshi8278 | @mrsjenniferwinchester | @k-slla | @jackles010378 | @jamerlynn     M.Late 20s.

Dean was able to pull out much more than he thought he remembered reliving things he only dreamed about at night or saw as soon as he closed his eyes.  “The fact that you dream about them is good if you think about it.” she told him when he stopped talking. “We can’t change the past but the fact that when you’re awake that doesn’t happen confirms that it’s no longer part of your life that you can let it go. Kind of like when you have a panic attack I know I’m downplaying but it’s to try to get into the conversation; you feel bad because you focus on the worst-case scenarios that invade your brain but all you have to do is resign yourself to the worst and come up with a plan to solve it even if you realize as you go along that it’s not all as you had thought. Around us we have people who love us they are relatively well and life in one way or another is going on. Again we can’t change what happened the only thing we can do is focus on the here and now and make a difference.”  She did not know what more pertinent to say to him but he appreciated those words.

A doctor walked in to check Dean but as I stepped out of the room I heard him whisper “Dean Winchester – tearing you apart is going to make my damn day.”  Somehow while they were struggling I had the wherewithal to grab Dean’s boots and my bag and scoot out the door soon to be joined by Dean limping along by my side. We made it to a supply closet and Dean grabbed something and started drawing on the ceiling with it. He had me press my back against the far corner of the closet and somehow when the doctor stepped through the threshold he couldn’t move.  Dean began chanting in Latin – ‘is that an exorcism?’ I wondered. ‘I gotta remember this so I can write a book!’  Once the black cloud of smoke cleared the man’s body Dean grabbed him pulled on his scrubs and we took off.  “Take me to your house so I can get my gear and get the eff outta here.”  “I kinda don’t want you at my house” I admitted.  “I don’t wanna do that either but this is life and death so let’s go” he implored me. “I need my weapons from the trunk.”  “Fine” I grumbled as we made our way to my car. “You better not kill me. I have friends who will help prosecute you.”  “I’m trying to save you not kill you” he assured.  As we rushed into the house he began barking orders “tell me where your laundry is and get your stuff packed. We gotta hide you for a few days.”  “You can’t just march in my house and start bossing me around!”  “The hell I can’t!” he barked as he began undressing “we need to change clothes and get the heck out of here!”  “What?! NO!”  “You can either do as you’re told or I can make you” he threatened.  “You’re turning out to be quite insufferable!” I shouted as I walked toward my room. “The laundry is at the back of the kitchen.”  Ten minutes later I met him in the kitchen with two bags – one my backpack with my laptop and some work essentials and the other was a duffel of clothing I’d attempted to put a variety of things in the bag so I was prepared for everything – I’d find out later that I wasn’t ready for any of this.  “Two bags?”  “Yeah I need my gear and some clothes. Gah you’re such a man” I rolled my eyes at his implication that I was bringing too much stuff.  “Good do you have a gun?”  I huffed “do I look like a girl with a gun? And furthermore you have plenty in that car of yours.”  “Speaking of my Baby where is she?”  “Baby?” I giggled “ok so the word baby meant the car and not a baby?”  “I don’t have a baby” he assured “now let’s go before something bad happens.”  “I wanna grab one thing – in case we end up not coming back for a while” the last part of my sentence came out quieter because I was kind of hoping I didn’t have to leave my home for good. I had a great thing going here – yet there was this pull to follow this man no matter the cost so I grabbed my tiny photo album and stuffed it in my bag with my laptop.  “Do you have first aid stuff?” he asked and I realized his stitches on the side must have popped.  “I’ll grab it” as I came back with every possible first aid item I owned he asked a question that terrified me.  “Do you smell smoke?”  We got out of the house and into the garage in time to see flames and smoke coming from the back of the house.  “Get in the car now!” he roared.  “You’re bleeding” I attempted to argue.  “Now!”  I all but dove into the car and we backed straight through the garage door before peeling down the street.  “You broke my door!”  “I’ll buy you a new one” he chuckled darkly and I once again wondered why I had just followed this man so blindly.  “You need your side patched up.”  “I’ll live.”  I crossed my arms and pouted a bit but I couldn’t stay mad at him – a fact I was beginning to hate.  “Where are we going?”  “Bobby’s” he replied curtly.  Four hours later I was being shaken awake “I’m hungry and we need fuel.”  “You need patched up” I murmured.  “It stopped bleeding but yeah” he admitted “I do need bandaged up.”  A few minutes later we pulled into a little clearing and Dean dragged himself from the car.  I scurried out my side to meet him at the trunk and clean his side up. We chatted as I checked the damage – every brush of my fingertips against his skin sent lightening bolts through my body ‘why was I reacting like this?’  “It looks like two stitches are broken” I told him “I think we can keep the bleeding down with this” I pulled some liquid bandage out and painted a bit on the spot between the stitches making sure to keep it on his skin only and not to make contact with the stitches themselves.  He winced “I know that probably stings but you’ll be better off.”  “Yeah yeah whatever just get it done.”  “So Bobby’s huh?” I asked as we made our way back onto the road.  “Yep.”  “Where is that?”  “Sioux Falls” he answered.  “Really?”  “Yeah where’d you think he lived?”  “No clue. I didn’t think he actually had a home” I chuckled. “We don’t exactly do Sunday dinner but he’s the one person I could rely on since I was 15” I explained “So I keep his contact info in my phone.”  SPN Fam:  @all-alone-he-turns-to-stone | @lyarr24    @dean-winchester-is-a-warrior | @nancymcl    @deans-baby-momma     @squirrelnotsam | @leigh70 | @impalaslytherin  @mishkatelwarriorgoddess | @deans-spinster-witch     @perpetualabsurdity | @bumbleb10 | @mrswhozeewhatsis | @123passwort     @roseblue373 | @jackles010378 | @hobby27  Mr. Green-eyes Tags:  @akshi8278 | @mrsjenniferwinchester | @k-slla | @jackles010378 | @jamerlynn     M.Late 20s.

It was as if what I was doing to their bodies was tearing my soul apart I felt their pain folding over me so hard that I vomited.”  Lachelle placed a hand on his knee while continuing to stare into the void so that he would not feel the pressure; in this they were very similar and she acted as she wished they had done to her. Dean was able to pull out much more than he thought he remembered reliving things he only dreamed about at night or saw as soon as he closed his eyes.  “The fact that you dream about them is good if you think about it.” she told him when he stopped talking. “We can’t change the past but the fact that when you’re awake that doesn’t happen confirms that it’s no longer part of your life that you can let it go. Kind of like when you have a panic attack I know I’m downplaying but it’s to try to get into the conversation; you feel bad because you focus on the worst-case scenarios that invade your brain but all you have to do is resign yourself to the worst and come up with a plan to solve it even if you realize as you go along that it’s not all as you had thought. Around us we have people who love us they are relatively well and life in one way or another is going on. Again we can’t change what happened the only thing we can do is focus on the here and now and make a difference.”  She did not know what more pertinent to say to him but he appreciated those words.

By the time I fully woke up whoever saved me was long gone. The only person I had left was some grumpy old dude who sat with me a few days and then had to leave town.”  “What was his name?”  “Bobby” I started to answer but was rudely cut off.  “Bobby? Bobby Singer was the volunteer?”  “How do you know his last name?”  “He’s my” Dean paused “he’s like a father to me.”  “So you know where he lives?” I asked hopefully.  “Yeah in fact can you help me get out of here? If you do I’ll take you to him.”  Distrust began seeping back in and I asked “what’s the thing Bobby’s known for?”  Dean gaped at me for a moment “killing demons and wearing trucker caps.”  I just sat there thinking ‘did this dude just say Bobby kills demons?!”  “Yes sweetheart you heard me right. Bobby Singer started as a demon hunter and now he hunts all manner of evil.”  “Ok so if demons and Rougarous are real what about like vampires and mermaids?”  “I’ve never seen a mermaid – yet so don’t rule that one out but yeah vamps are real so are werewolves shapeshifters anything that’s nasty and haunts the dark corners.”  “Bigfoot?”  “Nope he’s not real.”  “You seem certain.”  “Trust me sweetheart.

No ID -CH 4 - Rougarous Vampires and Mermaids  Summary: You’re a writer but in your free time you volunteer at the local hospital and that’s how you met him. A very beautiful man found alone and dying in an abandoned warehouse. After being asked to sit with him and see if your presence causes him to wake or at least respond you do but that choice may change you in ways you could never have imagined.   Characters: Dean Winchester Sam Winchester Bobby Singer Marla (OFC) You/Reader  Warnings: hospital stay mentions of death both in the hospital setting and the reader’s past show level violence/ gore angst fluff. Expect more/ new warnings as each chapter requires.   Chapter Warnings: reader learns that Bobby never told her the full truth demons try to smoke Dean and reader out of her house   A/N: this whole fic came from this one image  Word Count: 1337  Divider and Cover Image by me  Masterlist | Series Masterlist  “Only way to stop a Rougarou is to light them on fire so either you or some hunter put him down?”  “How did you know that?”  “I told you that was a monster and the man who saved you was probably a hunter maybe even the guy you said came and sat with you in the hospital.”  “Well why didn’t he tell me the truth then?”  “How old were you?”  &lt;!-- more --&gt; “Just shy of my fifteenth birthday” I answered.  “He might have been trying to save you from being permanently scarred.”  “What was his name?”  “No clue” I replied “I was in and out of consciousness for a couple days. By the time I fully woke up whoever saved me was long gone. The only person I had left was some grumpy old dude who sat with me a few days and then had to leave town.”  “What was his name?”  “Bobby” I started to answer but was rudely cut off.  “Bobby? Bobby Singer was the volunteer?”  “How do you know his last name?”  “He’s my” Dean paused “he’s like a father to me.”  “So you know where he lives?” I asked hopefully.  “Yeah in fact can you help me get out of here? If you do I’ll take you to him.”  Distrust began seeping back in and I asked “what’s the thing Bobby’s known for?”  Dean gaped at me for a moment “killing demons and wearing trucker caps.”  I just sat there thinking ‘did this dude just say Bobby kills demons?!”  “Yes sweetheart you heard me right. Bobby Singer started as a demon hunter and now he hunts all manner of evil.”  “Ok so if demons and Rougarous are real what about like vampires and mermaids?”  “I’ve never seen a mermaid – yet so don’t rule that one out but yeah vamps are real so are werewolves shapeshifters anything that’s nasty and haunts the dark corners.”  “Bigfoot?”  “Nope he’s not real.”  “You seem certain.”  “Trust me sweetheart. I know a thing or two.”  I wasn’t sure what to think sure Bobby had been secretive and told me to protect my apartment – a practice I still kept all these years later but was he really some monster hunting badass?  A doctor walked in to check Dean but as I stepped out of the room I heard him whisper “Dean Winchester – tearing you apart is going to make my damn day.”  Somehow while they were struggling I had the wherewithal to grab Dean’s boots and my bag and scoot out the door soon to be joined by Dean limping along by my side. We made it to a supply closet and Dean grabbed something and started drawing on the ceiling with it. He had me press my back against the far corner of the closet and somehow when the doctor stepped through the threshold he couldn’t move.  Dean began chanting in Latin – ‘is that an exorcism?’ I wondered. ‘I gotta remember this so I can write a book!’  Once the black cloud of smoke cleared the man’s body Dean grabbed him pulled on his scrubs and we took off.  “Take me to your house so I can get my gear and get the eff outta here.”  “I kinda don’t want you at my house” I admitted.  “I don’t wanna do that either but this is life and death so let’s go” he implored me. “I need my weapons from the trunk.”  “Fine” I grumbled as we made our way to my car. “You better not kill me. I have friends who will help prosecute you.”  “I’m trying to save you not kill you” he assured.  As we rushed into the house he began barking orders “tell me where your laundry is and get your stuff packed. We gotta hide you for a few days.”  “You can’t just march in my house and start bossing me around!”  “The hell I can’t!” he barked as he began undressing “we need to change clothes and get the heck out of here!”  “What?! NO!”  “You can either do as you’re told or I can make you” he threatened.  “You’re turning out to be quite insufferable!” I shouted as I walked toward my room. “The laundry is at the back of the kitchen.”  Ten minutes later I met him in the kitchen with two bags – one my backpack with my laptop and some work essentials and the other was a duffel of clothing I’d attempted to put a variety of things in the bag so I was prepared for everything – I’d find out later that I wasn’t ready for any of this.  “Two bags?”  “Yeah I need my gear and some clothes. Gah you’re such a man” I rolled my eyes at his implication that I was bringing too much stuff.  “Good do you have a gun?”  I huffed “do I look like a girl with a gun? And furthermore you have plenty in that car of yours.”  “Speaking of my Baby where is she?”  “Baby?” I giggled “ok so the word baby meant the car and not a baby?”  “I don’t have a baby” he assured “now let’s go before something bad happens.”  “I wanna grab one thing – in case we end up not coming back for a while” the last part of my sentence came out quieter because I was kind of hoping I didn’t have to leave my home for good. I had a great thing going here – yet there was this pull to follow this man no matter the cost so I grabbed my tiny photo album and stuffed it in my bag with my laptop.  “Do you have first aid stuff?” he asked and I realized his stitches on the side must have popped.  “I’ll grab it” as I came back with every possible first aid item I owned he asked a question that terrified me.  “Do you smell smoke?”  We got out of the house and into the garage in time to see flames and smoke coming from the back of the house.  “Get in the car now!” he roared.  “You’re bleeding” I attempted to argue.  “Now!”  I all but dove into the car and we backed straight through the garage door before peeling down the street.  “You broke my door!”  “I’ll buy you a new one” he chuckled darkly and I once again wondered why I had just followed this man so blindly.  “You need your side patched up.”  “I’ll live.”  I crossed my arms and pouted a bit but I couldn’t stay mad at him – a fact I was beginning to hate.  “Where are we going?”  “Bobby’s” he replied curtly.  Four hours later I was being shaken awake “I’m hungry and we need fuel.”  “You need patched up” I murmured.  “It stopped bleeding but yeah” he admitted “I do need bandaged up.”  A few minutes later we pulled into a little clearing and Dean dragged himself from the car.  I scurried out my side to meet him at the trunk and clean his side up. We chatted as I checked the damage – every brush of my fingertips against his skin sent lightening bolts through my body ‘why was I reacting like this?’  “It looks like two stitches are broken” I told him “I think we can keep the bleeding down with this” I pulled some liquid bandage out and painted a bit on the spot between the stitches making sure to keep it on his skin only and not to make contact with the stitches themselves.  He winced “I know that probably stings but you’ll be better off.”  “Yeah yeah whatever just get it done.”  “So Bobby’s huh?” I asked as we made our way back onto the road.  “Yep.”  “Where is that?”  “Sioux Falls” he answered.  “Really?”  “Yeah where’d you think he lived?”  “No clue. I didn’t think he actually had a home” I chuckled. “We don’t exactly do Sunday dinner but he’s the one person I could rely on since I was 15” I explained “So I keep his contact info in my phone.”  SPN Fam:  @all-alone-he-turns-to-stone | @lyarr24    @dean-winchester-is-a-warrior | @nancymcl    @deans-baby-momma     @squirrelnotsam | @leigh70 | @impalaslytherin  @mishkatelwarriorgoddess | @deans-spinster-witch     @perpetualabsurdity | @bumbleb10 | @mrswhozeewhatsis | @123passwort     @roseblue373 | @jackles010378 | @hobby27  Mr. Green-eyes Tags:  @akshi8278 | @mrsjenniferwinchester | @k-slla | @jackles010378 | @jamerlynn     M.Late 20s.

Jack still loves the library and spends hours with Sam going over lore and theories on magic and monsters and in his free time he volunteers at shelters or community centers.

150,Supernatural,['sometimes you must peer review your own thoughts'  'spn'  'dean winchester'  'sam winchester'  'wincest'],monstersandbrothers,every time i see a post where someone calls something sam and dean do “typical sibling behavior” my first instinct is to argue that nothing sam and dean do is typical sibling behavior. but i don’t actually think that’s right. yes they’re codependent and fucked up insane about each other in so many ways but what ADDS to the insanity of their relationship is that they do do stuff that is just so normal brothers. normal bickering and pranks and sibling rivalry. like how do u proclaim ur undying soul deep eternal devotion to ur brother and then in the next breath be like ew your food is gross and you smell and you broke my computer with your porn i’m gonna kill you. and then back to making out four seconds later. like yeah okay. that’s actually way crazier,2024-07-08 16:46:20 GMT

Because again Sam loves Dean more than like anyone else. And because I’m a Sam-coded Dean girl. (Yes I know I said it the other way on the other post. I’m both okay. Shut up. I’m a middle child. It doesn’t have to make sense.)   I relate so much to Dean. Okay. He gave up so much of his childhood so his brother could have some of one. He always gave Sam more than he got and made sure Sam was safe.   Dean went through hell (literally!) for his little brother. And he’d do it again. Of course Sam deserves the world but so does Dean. And they’d both die before taking it from the other. And they have.   I mentioned in my Sam defense post that Sam always tried to respect Dean’s autonomy and that Dean tries to fix his grief by taking his brother’s autonomy. And that’s still true but it’s because Dean can’t see how a life without a brother by your side is worth living. He doesn’t see how Sam could possibly be happy living in his memories memories of someone else’s thanksgiving or being in hell. And Sam doesn’t get how Dean could possibly want to leave heaven just to be with him. They both have crippling self esteem issues and neither knows how to communicate their needs with the other because they weren’t raised in that kind of environment and aren’t the most receptive to that kind of communication. No matter how much they try to be.  I see so much of myself in Dean. Always trying to stop the arguing when tensions get to high being the peacemaker and a parent’s shoulder to cry on from a young age. Rarely being recognized for sacrifices sacrifices going unnoticed growing up and being bad at sharing feelings because you never had the chance to truly talk about them growing up and because you are tired of feeling judged for having feelings. He always did his best with what he had and he was never really given enough.   So yeah you’re allowed to hate Sam or Dean. That’s your right your prerogative and your choice. But neither Sam nor Dean could ever hate the other. They are intertwined bound together. Two sides of the same coin. And they love each other too much to hate the other.   Sam said it best when he said “and what do you think my job is? You saved my life. Over and over. I mean you sacrifice everything for me. Don’t you think I’d do the same for you? You’re my big brother there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for you.”  And sure Sam didn’t always do it the way Dean would have liked but they’re not the same person and Sam has his own way of showing his love for Dean. But they both deserve that love.,2024-07-08 16:24:09 GMT

And I have to keep myself from defending Sam because Dean isn’t the only one. (If you can’t tell I’m a very Dean-coded Samgirl and I have to remind myself that most of the time the creators of the edit or post know this and they’re just highlighting Dean’s experience. And I can appreciate that.) so this is my Sam appreciation/defense post because I have feelings.   Sam deserved everything and more he wasn’t always the best brother but neither was Dean and the ways both brothers struggle are with things they superimpose on themselves because they don’t know how to handle their grief or how to live without the other. Dean tries to fix it by taking his brother’s autonomy Sam tries to respect Dean’s autonomy when he dies or something happens it’s why he didn’t just go call an ambulance like he wanted to in the finale (I know I usually say non-existent finale but I’m making a point.) it’s why he didn’t look for Dean while he was in purgatory he figured Dean was probably in heaven and he couldn’t imagine a world where taking that away from him was good. (Also he was traumatized and tired of losing people.)   He went through so much crap and it’s so overlooked by the writers directors and a majority of the fandom. And as someone who was overlooked growing up (even now frankly I mean my parents were doing steak dinners for our birthdays now since we’re all adults and they did for both my brother’s previous birthdays and my birthday we did burgers and hotdogs with the whole family which was fine but also still left me out. Anyway) because they hid what they were feeling and going through and hid it well it’s so obvious to me when someone else is hurting and it just bothers me so much to see it ignored in the fandom. Claiming to be a Dean Stan and hating Sam is outrageous to me because Sam is someone Dean loves so much. How you can hate someone he loves just confuses me.   I see so much of myself in Sam a tired burnt out gifted kid who gave everything his all until it was taken away. Who had his hopes and dreams and interests shunned and criticized by the people who were supposed to encourage him and when he finally got out of that situation he got dragged back in. (I know it’s more complicated but I’m focusing on specific aspects.)  Now you don’t have to like Sam or even some or most of his choices but to hate Sam in Dean’s name is wrong. Dean loved Sam more than anyone else (yes this includes Cas it may have been different but he still loved Sam more.)   Dean himself said it best “that’s my job right. Look out for my pain in the ass little brother.” And “I had to look out for you. Thats my job.” And “that’s my job right. Show my little brother the ropes.”   No one loves Sam more than Dean and the fact that someone could love Dean and hate Sam just doesn’t compute in my brain. And again I know that’s not usually what’s going through these creators’ minds but it still irks me 😂   post defending/appreciating dean,2024-07-08 16:20:40 GMT

Sam already taller at 15 years old than his older brother Dean; who decided to drop out and just get his GED.      Their father John was a relentless hunter always on the trail of supernatural creatures that lurked in the shadows. His long absences meant that Sam and Dean had to grow up fast learning to take care of each other in a world filled with danger and uncertainty.     One warm summer afternoon the brothers decided to escape the confines of their motel room and head to the park. They found a secluded spot under an ancient oak tree its branches stretching wide and providing a cool respite from the blaring sun. They lay on the grass their legs intertwined staring up at the sky. The leaves rustled gently in the breeze casting playful shadows over their faces. It was one of those rare moments of tranquility where the world seemed to pause just for them. Dean pulled off his Led Zeppelin t-shirt to reveal a white tank top underneath.      “Remember that time we snuck out to the drive-in?” Dean asked a smirk playing on his lips balling up his shirt to throw at Sam.      Sam chuckled “Yeah and you got us caught because you insisted on honking the horn during the jump scares.”     Dean laughed the sound rich and warm “Worth it. That was a great night.”     Their laughter faded into comfortable silence each lost in their thoughts. It was in these moments that they found solace a brief escape from the relentless hunt.     ———     As the days passed they shared everything—secrets fears and the burdens of their family legacy. Sam had finally opened up to his brother about wanting to go to college and Dean decided at that point that he would secretly do whatever it took to get Sammy there.      Dean decided to take Sam out after eating the same thing for the last three nights they walked down the dirt path towards the diner.      As the pair walked into the slightly run down building a soft chime introduced them to the rest of the patrons. Sam picked the booth all the way in the back still not totally comfortable with how tall and standoutish we was.      A cheerful waitress with a beehive hairstyle approached their table her name tag reading “Betty.” She greeted them with a warm smile. “What can I get for you boys today?”     Dean grinned his eyes lighting up. “We’ll take a large vanilla milkshake two straws please.”     Betty winked and jotted down their order. “Coming right up.”     The brothers settled into a comfortable silence the low hum of conversation and clinking dishes around them creating a soothing backdrop. A few minutes later Betty returned balancing a tall glass filled with creamy vanilla goodness topped with a generous swirl of whipped cream and a cherry on top. She placed it in the center of the table sliding two straws into the thick shake.     “Enjoy boys” she said with a smile before bustling off to tend to other customers.     Dean leaned forward taking a long sip from his straw. His eyes closed in bliss as the cold sweet flavor washed over his tongue. “Man that’s good. Just what we needed.”     Sam followed suit savoring the nostalgic taste of their shared treat. He couldn’t help but smile a genuine expression of happiness that had become rare in their line of work. “It’s been a while since we’ve done this” he admitted his voice soft.     Dean’s eyes met his brother’s a glint of warmth and understanding in his gaze. “Yeah too long.”      They sat there sipping their milkshake and sharing quiet conversation reminiscing about simpler times and laughing at old memories. The weight of their responsibilities and the darkness they faced daily seemed to lift if only for a moment. The milkshake a simple indulgence became a symbol of their bond—an unspoken promise that no matter what they would always find their way back to each other.     As the last of the milkshake disappeared through their straws Dean leaned back with a satisfied sigh. “We should do this more often Sammy.”     Sam nodded a small smile playing on his lips. “Yeah we should.”     In that moment surrounded by the comforting hum of the diner and the fading light of day the Winchester brothers found a rare sense of peace. It was a fleeting respite but it was enough to remind them that no matter how dark their path became they would always have each other. And sometimes that was all they needed.     ——     One night after a particularly grueling hunt they returned to their motel room. The air was thick with unspoken words the silence between them heavy with emotion. Dean could see the exhaustion and pain in Sam’s eyes and he felt a fierce protectiveness surge within him. He reached into his duffel bag and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. Lighting one he took a long drag the smoke curling around him before handing it to Sam.     Sam hesitated for a moment before taking the cigarette inhaling deeply. The nicotine hit his system providing a momentary escape from the stress. They sat on the edge of the bed passing the cigarette back and forth in silence. Dean reached for a couple of beers they had snagged from a local convince store earlier. He popped the caps off and handed one to Sam.     “To surviving another day” Dean toasted clinking his bottle against Sam’s.     Sam smiled faintly taking a swig “To us.”     They drank in silence the beer a bitter but welcome relief. The cigarettes and alcohol created a hazy cloud that momentarily shielded them from their harsh reality. As they finished their drinks Dean put his arm around Sam pulling him close.     “Dean” Sam whispered his voice raw with emotion “I don’t know how much longer I can do this.”     Dean tightened his grip his thumb gently caressing the nape of Sam’s neck “We’ll get through it Sammy. We always do.”     Their bond was unlike anything else. It was deeper than friendship stronger than blood. In the quiet moments when the world faded away it was just the two of them. They knew their relationship was unconventional a secret they kept fiercely guarded. But in those stolen moments they found a love that transcended the boundaries of brotherhood.     The nights were often the hardest. The weight of their father’s expectations the endless hunt and the constant threat of danger took its toll. But in the darkness they found light in each other. They would lie in bed tangled in each other’s arms finding solace in the warmth of their bodies. Dean would press soft kisses to Sam’s forehead murmuring words of comfort and reassurance.     Their love was a refuge a sanctuary from the chaos of their lives. It was in those quiet intimate moments that they found the strength to keep going. They knew that no matter what they would always have each other—two souls intertwined forever bound by love and destiny.     ———     The day had been perfect one of those rare summer days when the sun was warm but not too hot and the sky was a clear endless blue. Sam and Dean had decided to take a break from their relentless hunting to enjoy a bit of normalcy something that had been missing from their lives for far too long.     They found a secluded lake hidden away from the main road and surrounded by thick lush forest. The water was crystal clear reflecting the sky and the trees like a mirror. It was the kind of place that seemed almost too perfect to be real a hidden paradise just for them.     Dean parked the Impala under the shade of a large oak tree and they both got out feeling the soft grass under their boots. Sam was the first to break the silence a rare genuine smile lighting up his face.     “Come on Dean. Last one in is a rotten egg” he called out already pulling off his shirt and kicking off his boots.     Dean laughed shaking his head as he watched his brother sprint towards the water. “Oh you’re on little brother.”     In moments both of them were stripped down to their boxers racing towards the edge of the lake. Sam reached the water first diving in with a splash that sent ripples across the surface. Dean followed close behind his own entry just as enthusiastic. The water was cool and refreshing a welcome relief from the summer heat.     They swam and splashed around their laughter echoing through the trees. It was a carefree joyous moment a rare escape from their usual lives filled with danger and darkness. After a while they floated on their backs side by side looking up at the sky.     “This is perfect” Sam said softly his voice filled with contentment.     Dean turned his head to look at his brother a smile tugging at his lips. “Yeah it really is.”     After a few more moments of floating they swam back to the shallower part of the lake where they could stand. Dean splashed Sam playfully grinning as his brother retaliated with a laugh.     “Come on let’s see if you can catch me” Dean teased swimming a bit further out.     Sam determined chased after him the two of them moving through the water with ease. When he finally caught up he grabbed Dean by the arm pulling him close. They were both breathless from laughing their faces inches apart.     For a moment time seemed to stand still. The laughter faded replaced by a different kind of intensity. Sam’s hand still held Dean’s arm their wet skin slick against each other. Dean’s eyes searched Sam’s face and what he saw there made his heart race.     With a soft smile staring into his eyes Sam leaned in his lips brushing against Dean’s in a soft gentle kiss. Dean didn’t pull away; instead he kissed back his arms wrapping around Sam’s waist to pull him even closer. The kiss deepened as Sam wrapped just arms around Dean’s neck.     When they finally broke apart Dean rested his forehead against Sam’s forehead. “Holy shit Sammy.” Dean murmured his voice filled with a mix of awe and affection.     Sam’s face turned a deep shade of red his usual confidence momentarily giving way to shyness. He hid his face in the crook of Dean’s neck his voice a soft whine. “Dean…”     Dean chuckled the sound vibrating through both of them. He tilted Sam’s chin up gently with his hand forcing his brother to meet his gaze. “Give me another kiss” Dean whispered his eyes dark with desire and affection.     Sam blushed madly but he couldn’t hide the smile that tugged at his lips. He leaned in again closing the distance between them. This time their kiss was deeper more certain. Dean’s hands found their way to the back of Sam’s head fingers threading through his damp hair.      The world around them seemed to disappear leaving only the two of them in their own little universe. The water lapped gently at their bodies the coolness a stark contrast to the heat building between them.     Dean broke the kiss just enough to murmur against Sam’s lips “I love you Sammy.”     Sam’s heart skipped a beat. He pulled back and smiled widely at his bother. “I love you Dean.”      They swam back to shore ready to go back to the motel and kiss more.,2024-07-08 16:15:25 GMT

(a side note: this actually fits very well with sam’s character arc throughout the season because he’s doing the same thing. he claims he’s chosen dean and refused his fate (or is trying to at least) but he is also the one who keeps pursuing it by chasing after john (a symbol for their fate) and continuing to hunt (which is what azazel wants him to do). he thinks he is opposing fate while dancing right in the palm of azazel’s hand. so cool parallel here.)  this line also pops up in the midst of a pretty wide ideological gap between them—they’re opposed on the grounds of faith and the very existence of a god and this conflict drives the story forward. interesting then that a line that is so similar to what gordon told dean is nestled so neatly within this conflict—it seems to prove the point that whenever sam and dean are in conflict whenever they’re not choosing each other they are inevitably choosing their destinies. they can’t fight because it will drive them apart and the only other direction they can go other than toward their brother is toward their fate.  but what dean is doing with this line functionally is making an attempt to comfort sam.  don’t you want to know for sure? dean isn’t saying that sam is wrong anymore; he’s giving a concession by way of offering a solution to their conflict. he’s offering sam something real whatever that reality may turn out to be and he’s letting sam be the one who decides whether he wants to cling to faith or know what’s really going on. this gets through to sam and they go through with the seance.  and sam does see that dean was right. at the end of the episode he adopts dean’s pessimistic view of god and admits he was wrong. there’s a slight theme here too: when sam’s worldview is shaken and he is given evidence that he can go dark side he assimilates to dean’s worldview.  this happens in season 1 also. dean is the one who originally asserts the idea of “saving people” as part of their job. dean is the one who looks for hunts and advocates for saving as many people as they can even while sam is rather content to leave people to die to the monsters they know are out there (the most illustrative examples of this being 1x01 1x02 and 1x11). this only changes after 1x14 when sam is shown a mirror version of himself in max and has to confront the reality that he might be going down the path to evil. the demon wants something from him and from max and now he can’t ignore it anymore. and for the next several episodes it’s suddenly sam who is seeking out hunts sam who is trying to save people even when dean is reluctant to take a case.  what happened here? it’s a sudden and stark change and it’s reminiscent of what dean told sam back in wendigo; it’s reminiscent of how dean carries himself. sam is perhaps modeling himself after dean—he sees dean as someone to look up to as someone who is worthy where he is not as someone good where he is not. to sam if he can become more like dean he can be saved. he can avoid the fate that fell upon max.  and so we see this again in 2x13: sam has been presented with evidence that there is no god that no one is going to save him that he’s damned and forsaken. and he copes with this by admitting he was wrong and immediately adopting dean’s ideology as his own.  dean is good dean is right and if sam can just be a little bit more like his brother he can avoid the horrific fate lying in wait for him.  and he all but confirms this pattern in 3x07 too:  but herein lies a danger which brings me back to my original point. if dean’s line here parallels gordon if dean is voicing the echo of a man who embodies his fate then what does this mean for sam? if sam is so quick to change his beliefs and behaviors based on his admiration for dean that puts dean in a difficult and tenuous situation. because now at a time when dean is supposed to be solidly dragging sam away from his doom he’s backsliding toward his own—and he’s taking sam with him.  y&#x27;know like:,2024-07-08 17:36:46 GMT

(oh how young and naive all three of you are not knowing that the future only holds more of them in the inventory for you.)  but who is suguru to turn down a hunt like this? when there are innocent people’s lives at the end of it he is pretty much ready to do almost anything.  and that’s how you find yourself in the back seat of the impala arranging what little you can take on the plane to save your asses in case of actually having to get on the flight. satoru is speeding up as much as he can for the sake of catching the flight attendant suguru has been trying to reach for the last fifteen minutes.   (you are pretty sure he is also enjoying the crisp afternoon air hitting against his skin and the adrenaline but it’s not like you can prove it.)  “yeah i understand— well thank you have a good afternoon ma&#x27;am.” suguru’s silky voice is coated with customer service politeness as he hangs up the phone with a sigh.   “the flight is about to board in an hour.” suguru informs the two of you making the snow-haired boy click his tongue and drawing a sigh from you as equally tired as his one.   “call her cellphone again see if we can’t head her off in the pass.” unlike his usual self satoru gets quite serious at times like this; when he is unsure if he can make it or not.  suguru shakes his head in disappointment. “i already left her three voice messages. she must’ve turned her phone off.&quot;   he drops his head back and closes his eyes at the motion his free dark locks spread over wherever they can. your teeth sink into your lower lip you aren’t sure if you guys can pull this one off.  &quot;god we are not going to make it.” you whisper under your breath definitely not the best encouragement at the moment.  satoru clenches his jaw crystal blue eyes focused on the road in front of him. “we’ll make it.” he sounds so confident that it almost gives you hope.  you do in fact make it to the airport. it only takes about forty minutes and a soon-to-be-coming fine for speeding.   your hands feel sweaty no matter how much you keep wiping them on your pants as satoru talks over the phone with the flight attendant. with his attempts of trying to change her mind about getting on the flight awfully failing there is no other choice than actually getting on this flight.  you let out a groan when the flight attendant shuts the phone to satoru’s face. “god damn it.” one of suguru’s big callused hand sits on your shoulder comfortingly.   there was only one option; getting on this doomed-to-crash plane.   “okay plan b. we are getting on the plane.” suguru’s serious tone leaves no room for debate but with satoru looking at him wide eyed you knew something was about to go wrong.  “woah woah! hold on now!” crystal-blue eyes locked themselves with suguru’s dark purple ones. when the comforting warmth of his hand leaves your shoulder a sting forms on your chest.  “satoru that plane is leaving with over a hundred passengers on board.” you knew this tone of suguru it was his ‘i am in charge right now’ tone.  “and if we are right.. that plane is going to crash. you know that.” you add solemnly. satoru looks between the two of you there is an unexplained worry in his eyes.  “i know that.” he clicks his tongue.  “okay. so we are getting on the plane we need to find that demon and exorcise it.” you bit inside your cheek a nervous habit you picked up years ago.  “i’ll get the tickets you guys get whatever you can out of the trunk. whatever that will make through the security. meet me back here in five.” suguru points at the two of you eager to get through this as fast as possible.  “i already have some stuff ready thought it would be good to be prepared.” you show the dark brown bag filled with various items for this mission not the best preparation but it would help for sure.  “good that’s good. still check the trunk though.” suguru nods flashing a small smile. in the meantime satoru was looking at the two of you anxiously.   “are you okay?” you ask him softly he looks tenser than before. “not really.” his reply comes immediately after your question making suguru raise his eyebrows at him.   “what? what’s wrong?” you take a step next to him placing a hand on his arm. he looks away while huffing.  “i might have a small problem with.. uh..” suguru presses his lips together while you caress satoru’s arm soothingly.  “flying? you are scared of flying?” if it wasn’t such a serious moment you are sure both of you would be laughing at satoru.   “it wasn’t an issue until now!” satoru whines dropping his head on your shoulder and burying his face away from suguru.  “you are joking right?” suguru eyes him skeptically. satoru groans into your skin before meeting the dark purples directed at him.   “do i look like i’m joking? why do you think we drive everywhere suguru?” the dark haired boy lets out a huff you can already see the headache forming on his head as he becomes less impatient.  “all right we’ll go. you stay in the car and wait for us how about that?” an uneasy feeling fills you. you want to solve this case as much as suguru does but leaving satoru behind and getting on a plane doomed to crash is not on your bingo list. “wait what?” your questioning gets completely ignored by both of them.  “dude are you nuts? that plane is going to crush!” satoru protests his lips forming into a frown.  “satoru either we do this all of us together or you wait while we wrap up the hunt. i am not seeing a third option here.” suguru states becoming more impatient as the seconds fly by.   satoru’s frown turns into a childish pout. “suguru come on! really? oh man..”  it’s safe to say that all three of you got on the plane before it boarded. satoru was already fidgeting with your hands while suguru was looking over the journal. you are seated between them mostly for satoru’s comfort but it’s also nothing surprising. a quiet humming of a familiar hip-hop song is audible enough for you and suguru.   you bite inside your cheeks to not snort while stealing a glance from suguru who is in the exact same condition. as he leans in the familiar musk of cigarettes and a faint of vanilla fills your nostrils. god it was unfair how the two of them smelled so good all the time.  “are—” suguru can’t stop the small snort escaping from him “are you humming megan thee stallion?” you look away as you try your hardest to not laugh at your best friend.  “shut up it calms me down!” satoru glares at the silky haired man his big hand slightly pushing his head back. “yeah i would guess so..” you murmur under your breath and a sound suspiciously close to suguru’s snicker hits against your ear drums. you can’t help the tiniest smile forming on your lips.  “i can’t believe i am getting bullied like this! bullies both of you!” satoru huffs dramatically but it simply makes your smile grow more. at least he isn’t as anxious as before.  “look i know this isn’t the best situation to be in for any of us but we have to focus.” you pointedly look at the two of them bringing the conversation on the hunt once more.   “we got..” suguru checks his watch “thirty-two minutes and counting to track this damn thing down or whoever it’s possessing at the moment and perform a full-on exorcism.&quot;   satoru’s hold on your hand tightens. &quot;yeah on a crowded plane. that’s gonna be easy.” the sarcasm drips his words like honey.  “just one step at a time okay? now the million dollar question who is it possessing?” you try your best the keep everyone on track while assuring satoru at the same time.  “riko?” both boys answer syncing. the flight attendant is the most likely person in this scenario demons usually pick victims who are in emotional distress.   and as if the gods (well if they exist) heard you a flight attendant comes to satoru’s left. he quickly puts up his usual charm trying to mask the obvious nervousness he is feeling. “hey sweetheart are you riko?” the woman’s eyes trail between the three of you before she replies. “no i am not.&quot;   you press your lips together while satoru’s shoulders fall ever so slightly. &quot;oh my mistake.” the flight attendant hums eyes staying a bit longer on him before moving on.  satoru turns back to look at the back of the plane before meeting the two pairs of eyes on him. “all right she is probably the woman who is going to the back then.” his sweaty hand finally lets go of yours and you can’t help but sigh in relief— he has been holding onto it from the moment he got into the plane and normally you wouldn’t mind but your hand was starting to cramp under his grip.   “so i’ll go talk to her and uh i’ll get a read on her mental state.” he gives finger guns to the two of you making you snort softly.   “what if she is already possessed?” suguru asks skeptically. “well there are ways to test that.” you show the inside of your bag a virgin-mary-shaped bottle full of holy water is hard to miss amongst the stuff you brang. “we brought holy water.”  suguru quickly snatches the bag a tired sigh leaves his lips. “can’t we be more obvious? if she is possessed she’ll flinch at the name of god.” you roll your eyes at him even though he is right the holy water is still handy though.  “oh nice. okay.” satoru stands up ready to go and face the attendant but suguru catches his attention before he leaves.  “hey say it in latin.” satoru side eyes him before nodding but he isn’t able to leave when this time you stop him.  “uh in latin it’s christo.” sapphire eyes glare at the both of you “yeah i know!” he huffs walking to the back of the plane.  both of you can’t help the small giggles leaving your lips as you watch stomp away. your eyes meet with suguru’s and you can easily see how his dark amethyst ones are filled with worry. your right hand finds its way on his subtly stroking the back of it with your thumb. “we got this.&quot;   suguru’s gaze lingers on both of your hands his heart skipping a beat. &quot;yeah we got this.&quot;   when satoru comes back there is a defeated look on his face you can tell the result of his confrontation is not what you guys have been hoping for for.   &quot;well she is not possessed that’s for sure.” he leans back and closes his eyes. “you said christo?” you question him which gets you an eye roll from him. “yeah. there is no demon in her.&quot;   satoru takes in a long exhausted breath. &quot;okay that’s fine. while you are gone we found an exorcism that might work. the rituale romanum.” suguru informs the best solution that you guys have formed.  “it’s two parts. the first part expels the demon from the victim’s body. it makes it manifest which actually makes it more powerful.” your explanation makes satoru grimace. “and how is that helping us?&quot;   suguru clicks his tongue and continues for you. &quot;because the second part sends the bastard back to hell once and for all.” satoru sits back up reaching for your bag and taking out the homemade emf you crafted.   “well we gotta find it first.&quot;   as satoru subtly tries to search through the plane without getting caught there is only so little time left. a hand clapping his shoulder makes him slightly jump making suguru smirk ever so slightly.  &quot;dude don’t do that!” suguru backs up but the amusement sparkling in his eyes is clear. “anything?” to his question satoru only clicks his tongue and shakes his head.   “how much time we got?” you look at the watch on your wrist before answering him. “about fifteen minutes. maybe we missed somebody?” you offer which only makes him huff. “maybe the thing is just not on the plane.” suguru scoffs at that.   “you really believe that?” satoru shrugs “i will if you will.” before you can protest the emf meter spikes shutting all of you up. the three of you look at the direction the emf is pointing at.  there is a man who is clearly one of the pilots exiting from the bathroom and heading back to the cockpit. the three of you glance at each other before you whisper under your breath.   “christo.” the co-pilot slowly turns to face the three of you eyes turning a deep black as he flinches ever so slightly. a chill runs through your spine as he enters the cockpit.  “oh we are so fucked.” is all satoru says.  the three of you head to the back of the plane as fast as possible to find riko. “she is not going to believe us.” suguru muses out the thoughts going through your head he is scarily good at predicting what you are thinking as always.  “twelve minutes suguru. the plane will crash in twelve minutes if we don’t do this.” a sigh leaves the dark haired boy as he takes a step back for satoru to enter through the curtains which you two quickly follow after.   the flight attendant is a young sweet looking girl who can’t be older than twenty-one. she has dark hair and a beautiful pair of blue eyes you feel bad for what she is about to see in the next couple of minutes.   “oh hi! the flight is not too bumpy for you i hope.” she sounds as sweet as she looks which makes you feel worse. “yeah actually that’s kind of what we need to talk to you about.” she raises an eyebrow at his words while you close the curtain.   “erm okay. what can i do for you?” you step in feeling like if you explain in your way maybe things will sound less crazy for her.   “look i know that this is going to sound nuts and we unfortunately don’t have the time to give the &#x27;things that go bump in the night’ talk right now. we know that you were on flight 2485.” her smile disappears quickly with that.  okay maybe not the greatest beginning for this conversation.  “who are you guys?” she already sounds panicked eyeing the exit of the room. “we need your help to stop the same thing from happening again. here now.” suguru takes over the talk but it doesn’t seem like it’s getting any better.   “i’m sorry. i–” she stutters her eyes darting between the three of you before she tries to walk towards the exit. “—i’m very busy i have to go back.” satoru quickly stops her by putting an arm in front of her.   “hold on wait a second! we are not going to hurt you okay? the pilot in 2485 chuck lambert. he is dead.” riko’s lips part in shock the scared expression quickly washed away by the news.   “wait chuck is dead?” you nod looking into her blue eyes. satoru continues without wasting any more time. “he died in a plane crash. that’s two plane crashes in two months. doesn’t that sound strange?” with the skeptical look on her face you know that she is not really buying this and the small amount of time you three have left none of you can afford a fuck up.  “look there was something wrong with 2485. maybe you felt it maybe you didn’t. but there is something wrong with this flight too.” suguru hurriedly takes over once again. you know he is been thinking the same thing as you.   “riko you have to believe us please.” you pull out your oldest trick in the book a tactic you learned from satoru. it’s simple really. you tremble your lips ever so slightly giving desperate watery eyes pointed at your victim. it works like a charm.  riko looks away for a moment clearly debating over whether or not to share what is going through her mind before giving in. “on flight 2485.. there was this man with— with these black eyes.” suguru nods assuringly. “yes that is exactly what we are talking about.”  “i don’t understand. what do you want me to do?” there it is the opportunity all three of you have been waiting for. “the co-pilot we need you to bring the co-pilot here.” you look at your watch to check the time if this doesn’t work all of you are screwed.  “what— how am i supposed to bring the co-pilot here?” you can see suguru clenching his jaw your sweaty warm hand holds onto his toned arm squeezing slightly. “just do whatever it takes to get him in here.” his tone is final and riko can tell there is no coming back from this now.  she hesitates for a moment eyes darting around one final time before she nods. “okay.” you quickly get the bottle of holy water out of your bag and let suguru take it from you in exchange for the journal. the ritual is already open and ready to read.   the next couple of minutes are agonizingly slow and when the co-pilot finally enters the room everything speeds up drastically. satoru is quick to punch him in the face knocking him down and holding him against the floor with all his strength while suguru tapes his mouth. you can hear riko’s frightened voice rapidly asking what the hell are the three of you doing.  satoru says something to her but you can’t fully make up what it is. the disturbing sizzling of holy water hitting against the demon and its incomprehensible words mix in the air. however whatever he said must’ve convinced riko to leave because that’s exactly what she does.   “regna terrae cantate deo psallite domino—” your voice cut off when the demon manages to break free from satoru’s grasp and lashes out at you. his hand quickly fists your hair pulling it hard and slamming your face to the wall.   “fuck!” you yelp dropping the journal as suguru pulls the demon away from you with the help of satoru trying to hold him down. his concerned purple eyes search for any injuries on your face which seems to be a mistake because he gets thrown to the side.   the demon hits satoru with the back of his head making his nose start to bleed while lets out a pained groan. before any of them try and hold him down once more he grabs you by the collar of your shirt his foul breath hitting against your bloodied face.   “you think you can stop me? you the useless puppy who just follows these two around?” before you can register his words properly there is a fist hitting against your jaw. you can feel the deep ache spreading all over your head. “you are a pathetic excuse of a hunter! it’s a surprise he is even able to lo–” the demon gets thrown to the ground by suguru.   in the years of knowing him there is so little time that you saw suguru with this expression on his face. it’s something you never think you will see again each time it happens. his eyes darken with murderous rage the hatred he feels basically radiates from his body and if you are at arm’s length close to him you can feel the atoms vibrating.   he bashes the demon’s head on the ground and a punch follows right after another. satoru recovers before you coming to your side immediately and picking up the journal. his eyes look over your face for a second before he hurriedly gives you the journal and goes back to help suguru.   you are quick to finish the first part of the ritual words mixing with small groans and head swimming in pain. the black mess of gas exists through the co-pilot’s mouth and disappears into the vent.   “got it.” your voice sounds hoarse as you press your back to the wall your face hit against moments ago. “it’s on the plane we have to finish it now!” satoru’s hand holds against his bleeding nose making him sound funny.   the pain in the side of your head grows by every second it feels hard to keep yourself steady. and to make things worse the plane suddenly heaves violently the journal escapes from your hands once again as satoru’s scream fills your ears. he like you holds onto the wall with his dear life.   the lights on the plane flicker rapidly as your watery eyes find suguru’s for a moment. he holds so much emotion behind them it’s so heavy that it feels like he is sinking to the bottom of the ocean.  this can’t be how things end. he can’t lose you on a damn hunt he insisted to take not before he got to hold you against his chest and kissed all over your face not when he hadn’t even brave enough to say i love you.   the seconds feel like a lifetime when he finds the journal on the ground. his hands tremble searching through the pages to find the ritual. he can’t lose you or satoru. he can’t lose any of you because of his mistakes.   his voice is inaudible for you covered over by satoru’s and multiple passengers’ screams as he finishes the ritual. and as if nothing happened the plane goes back to how it was minutes ago. no lights flickering no violent shaking as that makes you feel like puking. it’s calm and steady.   suguru is in front of you before you can even notice his callused hands holding your face as if you are a delicate doll. “fuck are you okay?” definitely not the best question to ask at the moment but it still makes you smile. “i’ll be fine are you okay?” you direct the question back to him. he nods but it’s obvious it’s only to ease your worry.   you let out a pained sigh and let yourself go. your ass hits the ground rather harshly but you can’t seem to find the energy to care. right next to you is satoru who is looking at you with wide eyes while gripping his white shirt now stained with blood.   “i am never getting on a plane again.” your eyes stay on him for a good couple of seconds before you snort.   now that’s something you agree on.,2024-07-08 17:03:56 GMT

IT WAS YOUR REFUGE A SANCTUARY FROM THE WORLD’S HARSH EDGES. It was a reminder that each day is another day you get to spend the rest of your life with the love of your life.  You loved waking up next to Sam because his warmth radiated like your favorite hoodie chasing away the remnants of a cool summer night. Tucked into the space between his jaw and chest you could feel the steady rise and fall of his breath his arms encasing you.  Slowly you untangled yourself from his embrace careful not to disturb his sleep. The light of dawn peeked through the window painting a golden sheen across Sam’s face. His brow furrowed slightly a crease etched between his eyes usually reserved for facing down monsters but right now it softened with sleep replaced by the slight ajar of his lips.   Watching Sam sleep had you going through your memories in a flash—the way he surprised you with your favorite flowers after being gone from a hunt a shy smile gracing his features as he laid a gentle kiss on your reddened cheeks. You smiled wistfully when you recalled how Sam confessed to you his feelings the night he had gotten home from a hunt that went on too long and could’ve gone sideways.  The motel room door creaked open revealing a battered Sam Winchester. Dried blood stained the sleeve of his jacket and he was sporting a nasty gash on his right cheek a grim souvenir from the hunt gone south.  Exhaustion hung heavy around him a storm cloud threatening to unleash the floodgates of aches and pains. He wanted to go to sleep as soon as he stepped inside the dank motel room but the tiny flicker of light beneath the door held him captive.  There you were bathed in the warm glow of a lamp hands wringing together and brows crimped in worry. Sam seemed to forget all about sleep when he saw you. He has never yearned for anything the way he has right now with the sight of you his relic of normalcy in his chaotic world. He pushed the door open further the sound jarring in the silence.  You looked up surprise giving way to relief. “Sam! Thank goodness you’re alright. I was worried sick after you’ve been gone for so long.”  A weak smile formed on his lips. “We got them. Nasty ghouls took longer than expected.” He shuffled closer the weight of the hunt pulling at him. He could feel the warmth radiating from the room a stark contrast to the bone-chilling night he’d endured.  You stood up and reached out your hand brushing against his cheek. The touch even through the grime sent a jolt through him. It was a simple gesture yet it held the power to ground him to remind him of what he was fighting for—what he was going home to.  “You look like hell” you said your voice laced with concern. “Go wash up then I’ll get you something to eat. There’s a diner near here open 24/7 apparently Bobby told me on the phone earlier bless his gruff soul.”  He allowed himself to be ushered towards the bathroom crumpling onto the tub with a groan. As the hot water washed away the grime and fatigue something else started to wash over him. It was the weight of his unspoken feelings a truth he could no longer keep buried.  He emerged from the bathroom a fresh towel wrapped around his hair. You were already by the table a steaming cup of coffee and grub waiting for him. He caught your gaze the way your eyes held a warmth that chased away the chills of the hunt.  “Listen” Sam began his voice thick with emotion. You tilted your head in confusion as to what he was trying to say. “This life… it’s not easy. It’s dangerous messy and frankly it terrifies me sometimes.”  He took a deep breath his eyes locking with yours. “But then I come back here see you… and suddenly facing it all over again well it doesn’t seem so bad. It feels… bearable.”  A blush crept up your neck mirroring the heat rising in his own. You opened your mouth to speak but he pressed on.  “I know this is crazy” he said his voice barely a whisper. “But I can’t keep it in anymore. I… I care about you. A lot more than a friend.”  The silence stretched heavy with anticipation. He braced himself for a rejection the fear of a cold fist squeezing his heart. Then you reached out your hand gently cupping his cheek.  “Sam” you said your voice soft “you’re not the only one who feels that way.”  Relief flooded him warm and exhilarating. A hesitant smile spread across his face. “Really?”  You nodded your eyes sparkling. “For a long time actually.”  He leaned in the space between them collapsing in a rush. The kiss was soft a tentative exploration of your unspoken feelings toward each other. But within it there was a spark a promise of something deeper. He pulled back his forehead resting against yours a newfound warmth radiating from within.  “So” he whispered a grin tugging at his lips “does this mean I get to keep bothering you for a while longer?”  You chuckled a sound that filled the room with a melody of hope. “Looks like you’re stuck with me Winchester. Now about that coffee…”  He pulled you close the scent of coffee and the lingering warmth from the confession clinging to the air.   Yes in the face of whatever darkness awaited this peaceful moment with Sam was a treasure. You leaned in brushing a kiss against his cheek a silent promise whispered against his lips “I’ll wake you soon pretty boy.”  The sunlight bolder now sliced through the gap in the curtains landing right on Sam’s eyelids. He let out a soft groan sleep fading as he blinked the light away. Unlike you mornings weren’t exactly his best friend. For a moment his eyes fluttered closed again then snapped open a glimmer of surprise crossing his face when he realized you weren’t there.  “Morning baby” he mumbled his voice rough with sleep. He reached out instinctively his hand brushing against the empty space where you’d been. A frown tugged at his lips for a brief moment before it softened into a smile as he spotted you by the window.  You were turned away from him busy reading a paperback. The rising sun cast an ethereal glow around you highlighting the way your hair seemed to catch fire with golden light. A shiver danced down Sam’s spine a mix of the cool morning air and the unexpected sight before him.  “Hey there Sleepyhead” you said over your shoulder your voice laced with amusement as you turned back to face him. “You look like you could use some more shut-eye.”  He stretched languidly the movement sending a groan escaping his lips. “Nah I’m good. Just gotta get the lead out before Bobby gets impatient.” He winced slightly a reminder of the recent hunt probably still clinging to his muscles.  A playful glint lit up your eyes. “Lead out huh? Sounds fancy. Did you polish your shoes too Mr. Winchester?”  He chuckled a low rumble that sent a warmth radiating through you. “Only the finest demon-blood repellent for this hunter sweetheart.” He reached for you his hand warm and strong as he pulled you close grinning at how easily he could make you laugh with his comebacks.  As you snuggled into his embrace a comfortable silence settled between you. However a shadow lingered in the back of your mind. The thought of Bobby calling usually meant trouble brewing. You decided to break the comfortable silence.  “Any whispers about what Bobby wants this time?” you asked your voice soft.  Sam shook his head his expression turning serious. “Not a peep. Knowing Bobby it’ll involve something nasty a whole lot of rotgut and probably a cryptic message scribbled on some random book.” He paused his gaze softening on you.  “But whatever it is” he continued his voice low and reassuring “we’ll face it together. Like always.”  You leaned in your lips brushing against his cheek. “Always” you whispered the unspoken words hanging heavy in the air—together no matter what the coming day brought.,2024-07-08 18:23:44 GMT

"i'm saying that their inability to adequately escape their fate resulted in sam's predestined death"  "what i'm saying is that while much of the season focuses on sam's inability to fight fate dean also fails in many ways"  'and they both share culpability for how the season ended. a series of tragic mistakes and subconscious influences'  "god i hope i said all this well enough. anyway whatever it's done now"  'spn posting'  'spn2'  '.txt'],incesthemes,houses of the holy makes me totally crazy so here have more thoughts on this episode. when dean suggests a seance to confirm whether the angel is real or not he says this:  it feels startlingly similar to gordon’s words way back in 2x03:  this strikes me as thematically odd because by the time houses of the holy comes around dean has seemingly denied his father (represented by gordon) and refused his fate (also represented by gordon) in favor of his complete devotion to sam. since croatoan dean has been working on sam’s behalf and only sam’s behalf; everything else is unimportant to him now. he made his decision and his decision was sam.  but for him to be echoing gordon’s words would indicate quite the opposite. to me it sounds like he’s internalized gordon’s mindset and even if he’s not conscious of it he is walking in the footsteps of his fate through gordon’s influence. gorden is an allegory of dean’s fate: if dean is mirroring him in any way that should set off alarms. it means he’s not as directly opposed to destiny as he claims to be.  (a side note: this actually fits very well with sam’s character arc throughout the season because he’s doing the same thing. he claims he’s chosen dean and refused his fate (or is trying to at least) but he is also the one who keeps pursuing it by chasing after john (a symbol for their fate) and continuing to hunt (which is what azazel wants him to do). he thinks he is opposing fate while dancing right in the palm of azazel’s hand. so cool parallel here.)  this line also pops up in the midst of a pretty wide ideological gap between them—they’re opposed on the grounds of faith and the very existence of a god and this conflict drives the story forward. interesting then that a line that is so similar to what gordon told dean is nestled so neatly within this conflict—it seems to prove the point that whenever sam and dean are in conflict whenever they’re not choosing each other they are inevitably choosing their destinies. they can’t fight because it will drive them apart and the only other direction they can go other than toward their brother is toward their fate.  but what dean is doing with this line functionally is making an attempt to comfort sam.  don’t you want to know for sure? dean isn’t saying that sam is wrong anymore; he’s giving a concession by way of offering a solution to their conflict. he’s offering sam something real whatever that reality may turn out to be and he’s letting sam be the one who decides whether he wants to cling to faith or know what’s really going on. this gets through to sam and they go through with the seance.  and sam does see that dean was right. at the end of the episode he adopts dean’s pessimistic view of god and admits he was wrong. there’s a slight theme here too: when sam’s worldview is shaken and he is given evidence that he can go dark side he assimilates to dean’s worldview.  this happens in season 1 also. dean is the one who originally asserts the idea of “saving people” as part of their job. dean is the one who looks for hunts and advocates for saving as many people as they can even while sam is rather content to leave people to die to the monsters they know are out there (the most illustrative examples of this being 1x01 1x02 and 1x11). this only changes after 1x14 when sam is shown a mirror version of himself in max and has to confront the reality that he might be going down the path to evil. the demon wants something from him and from max and now he can’t ignore it anymore. and for the next several episodes it’s suddenly sam who is seeking out hunts sam who is trying to save people even when dean is reluctant to take a case.  what happened here? it’s a sudden and stark change and it’s reminiscent of what dean told sam back in wendigo; it’s reminiscent of how dean carries himself. sam is perhaps modeling himself after dean—he sees dean as someone to look up to as someone who is worthy where he is not as someone good where he is not. to sam if he can become more like dean he can be saved. he can avoid the fate that fell upon max.  and so we see this again in 2x13: sam has been presented with evidence that there is no god that no one is going to save him that he’s damned and forsaken. and he copes with this by admitting he was wrong and immediately adopting dean’s ideology as his own.  dean is good dean is right and if sam can just be a little bit more like his brother he can avoid the horrific fate lying in wait for him.  and he all but confirms this pattern in 3x07 too:  but herein lies a danger which brings me back to my original point. if dean’s line here parallels gordon if dean is voicing the echo of a man who embodies his fate then what does this mean for sam? if sam is so quick to change his beliefs and behaviors based on his admiration for dean that puts dean in a difficult and tenuous situation. because now at a time when dean is supposed to be solidly dragging sam away from his doom he’s backsliding toward his own—and he’s taking sam with him.  y&#x27;know like:,2024-07-08 17:36:46 GMT

"you can tell i'm going through my episode notes because i am suddenly very chatty today. sorry"  'spn posting'  'spn2'  '.txt'],incesthemes,i am genuinely obsessed with how gordon stole the keys to the impala in bloodlust because he simply had no logical support for that action. even eavesdropping on sam and dean’s argument he could hear dean defending him taking his side and before that point too gordon’s ideology was definitely winning over sam’s. gordon taking the keys then displays a paranoia that really won’t even fully actualize itself until croatoan.  because taking the keys means that gordon believes dean will side with sam. within the context of this episode that is exactly what happens when gordon reveals he killed his sister and dean decides Fuck That but on a larger scale it predicts how the rest of the season will go too. at this point in the season dean is still caught between two ideologies and he doesn’t make his choice until croatoan when his abstract duty vs sam conflict becomes real and he can no longer ponder it and must instead act. gordon knows who dean will side with before even dean knows himself—because dean spends the entire first half of the season desperately clinging to john (to his duty) trying to shove down his devotion to sam so that he can prepare himself to carry out his obligations and kill his brother.  and gordon alone knows what a futile effort it all is. he recognizes dean’s devotion because he’s an allegory for duty and so he understands too intimately all the ways dean is failing: duty or sam gordon or sam fate or sam. and gordon took the keys so that destiny can play out even when dean inevitably fails—so that they’re too late to stop gordon and so that they’re too late to stop fate.,2024-07-08 19:49:48 GMT

I miss the older seasons that were shot to make it more horror friendly (if that makes sense) by adding subtle piano notes playing music that crescendoed glimpse of ghost out of the corner of the eye and that blue/gray filter (that I like to call The Twilight filter)  Sam talking to Lily (daughter of the first victim) in a soft gentle way. He can see no one believes her or takes her seriously so he does. Aww Sam! Why did they stop using night vision cams and black lights?! This was cool! I’m gonna go out on a limb and say Sam smashed more mirrors than Dean (assuming he kept smashing a couple of more while Dean was talking to the cops) Speaking of mirrors Sam mentions that mirrors are a true reflection of soul which is why smashing them brings bad luck. Now adding points 4 and 5 I have a theory. Theory of Sam’s true reflection being smashed over and over again in the show. For starters Sam’s desire to live a safe and normal life is crushed with Jessica’s death. Him thinking that he was using his powers for good goes out of the window when killing Lilith starts the apocalypse. Sam fights against being Lucifer’s vessel only to willingly agree to it. Gosh!  Bloody Mary crawling out of the mirror on all fours Sam bleeding his eyes out almost dying but managing to throw sass when Dean calls him Sammy. “It’s Sam” And finally my favourite part of this episode: towards the end when Dean asks him what he secret was he draws a line asking for his right to privacy!,2024-07-08 19:18:53 GMT

The guitar is cradled in his lap the instrument almost like an extension of his body. His fingers dance over the strings in a flurry of movement each note and chord drawn from the strings. The music is mournful and soulful the sound of the blues seeping into the very air around him. He closes his eyes as he plays a cigarette tucked between his lips.     The crowd is captivated watching with rapt attention as the man plays. Some are nodding along to the music their eyes closed as they take in the sound. Others are tapping their feet or clapping along to the beat. There is a hushed atmosphere a kind of stillness that comes over the room as the music washes over everyone. The crowd is completely enthralled drawn in by the raw emotion and skill of the man’s guitar playing.     &lt;!-- more --&gt; Then out of the sudden Robert begins to hear the an animalistic growling. Almost as if it was a rabid dog his strumming holted his face contort with confusion. The crowd mimicked his expression before he started again the melody from the strings ringing through the bar. But the barking in the distance didn’t subside Robert began to fear for his life. Trying to carry on his performance but they crowd could sense his fear.     The shadows of the large animals casted from the front door of the bar Robert caught a glimpse of it but he was the only one who saw it. His cigarette fell from him lips onto the hard ground. The crowd murmured amongst themselves as to why he stopped and why he looked so terrified. The barking grew more angry more aggressive as Robert got up from the chair on the stage.     Breathing heavily before padding quickly out of the bar. His wife ran behind him concerned for her husband. Robert ran back through the dark bushy area guitar in his hand. But the barking and growling surrounded him he loosened his grip on his guitar. Abandoning it before running to his barn he locked the door behind him. Panting heavily it didn’t take long before the barn door received a harsh bang against the wall the dogs barking furiously.     Robert screamed his back pressed against the door before grabbing a chair to barricade it. He watched in fear praying for mercy as the dogs bangs harshly against the door. Knowing that he couldn’t escape this. He fell to his knees tears in his eyes fear in his chest. Soon after the door carved in and in came his two of his friends and his wife. Stumbling upon Robert seizing on the floor     “What’s going on?” One of the men asked concerned. “Oh my god” Sadie gasped at the sight of their friend rushing to Roberts’ side. He grunted and gasped for air pain coursing through his body. “Get a doctor! Run!!!” She screamed at one of the man. “What happened? Talk to me” She pleaded with Robert cradling his face in her hands. “Dogs.” He weakly responded. “Stay with us baby!” Sadie cried.      “Dogs. Black dogs” Robert grunts as he seized. “Bob? Robert don’t you die on me” Sadie pleaded shaking her husband his eyes went wide before finally taking his last breath. His wife being the last person to see or hear him alive.         _____________________________        •Present Time        The trio was sat in a diner eating breakfast as Sam was checking through the St. Louis Police Department records. A mugshot of Dean on his screen sifting through his criminal record. “So much for a low profile. You got a warrant in St. Louis. And now you’re officially in the Feds’ database” Sam shook his head in frustration. “Dude I’m like Dillinger of something” Dean smirks proudly sipping his water.     “Dean it’s not funny. It makes the job harder we gotta be more careful now” Y/N lectures. “Well what do they got on you two?” Dean asks. Sam rolls his eyes “I’m sure they just haven’t posted it yet.” Sam grumbles clicking in the laptop. “Nevermind they’ve got y/n’s juvie records from 2000 for assault” Sam grumbled. Y/N snorted at the memory “Oh right I got booted for three months when I clocked that perky cheerleader bitch for dumping chocolate milk on my leather jacket” She snickered.     “Come to think of it. I’m surprised Ballard never brought it up when she was listing out our lives” She says her and Sam share a look before both shrugging just brushing off the fact. “I thought you were a cheerleader? And wasn’t she your friend?” Dean cocked an eyebrow “I was and she was anything but a friend. She was captain of the squad and made my life even more of a living hell. It was like a bad chick-flick” Y/N huffed stabbing her fork into her fries.     Both boys chuckled at the memory amused by the petty girl problems. “Didn’t she try to steal your boyfriend after that too?” Sam perked up earning a glare from Y/N. “Oh yeaahhhh” Dean cackled while Sam snickered at Y/N’s expression. “What was his name again? Albert?” Dean questioned rubbing his finger in his finger. “Xander. Alexander” Y/N corrected letting out a snort at his guess.      “Albert? You think I’d date a guy named Albert?” She laughed earning a chuckle from Sam. Dean joined in on the laughter letting out a hearty chuckle trying to mask his jealousy shaking his head as he sipped from his own drink. “Alexander. What a stupid name.” He said through his laughter taking another sip from his mug. “Xander was not stupid. He was the sweetest” Y/N defended sipping her coffee.     “He’s a cop now. Remember when you got arrested in 02’ for that bar fight and he helped me bail you out” She reminded him of the memory nudging Dean with her elbow. Dean rolls his eyes letting out a scoff as he’s elbowed. “Yeah yeah yeah. The boy scout.” He scoffed. “I didn’t know Alex was a cop now” Sam said surprised having been in the same class as them witnessing most of their short relationship.     “Yep. Joined the academy straight outta high school right after you left for college” Y/N nodded. Sam nodded and hummed through a mouthful of food swallowing it before speaking. “How come you never dated him again? You guys seemed good together” Sam asked feigning innocence shooting his brother a sly side eye. Dean rolled his eyes knowing his brother is only asking to get on his nerves.      Y/N shrugged sipping on her coffee. “I don’t know. Just lost touch with each other I guess. I haven’t spoken to him in years.” She said casually setting down her mug. “Plus He’s a cop and I’m a hunter. It wouldn’t have worked out and I wasn’t looking for anything serious” She explained taking a bite out of her pancakes. A memory flashed across y/n’s mind and she couldn’t help but chuckle at it.     “When I went out of my first date with him I remember coming home to Dean sitting on Bobby’s porch with a baseball bat” She snorted. Dean choked on his drink. He hadn’t expected her to bring that up. Sam burst into laughter almost spitting out his food from trying to hold it back. The three hunters reminisced on their teenage years “Xander was terrified for his life” Y/N laughed.     Sam continued to laugh while Dean set down his mug and wiped his mouth. “You did what?!” Sam exclaimed in hysterics at his brother. “I was just making sure he was in for the right reasons” he said feigning innocence. Sam chuckled wiping at his shirt with his napkin. “Oh right. You were just being a big brother” he said through laughter not buying his excuse one bit.     Y/N grimaced at that “We were what? 18? We were kids what’d you expect?” She snorted. “That’s my point. You were kids. I was just a protective older brother” Dean defended looking away as he took another sip from his mug. Y/N grimaced again at Dean calling himself her older brother. She huffed rolling her eyes as Sam snorted and shook his head.     Muttering “Biggest lie of the century.” Under his breath as he finished off his food. They didn’t quite catch what Sam said. “Huh?” They questioned in unison. “What?” Sam said in an innocent voice pretending to not have said anything. Dean eyed Sam while Y/N cocked her eyebrow at his sudden change in mood. Dean and Y/N shared a look before shrugging it off.     “God being a teenager was such a pain in the ass” Dean shook his head with a sigh his eyes focused on his mug. “You sound like an old man” Y/N teased. “Hey! I’m only 27 thank you very much” Dean scowled crossing his arms. Sam snickered enjoying their bickering. “Yeah ancient. You’re basically a senior citizen” He commented. “Watch it or I’ll kick your ass!” Dean threatened playfully pointing a finger at Sam.     He snorted in return “Yeah right I bet you’d throw your back out doing that grandpa” Sam smirked. Y/N bursted out laughing at this. Throwing her head back caught off guard by Sam’s comeback. Reaching over to give Sam a high-five. “Burn!” She exclaimed in hysterics as Sam chuckled proudly giving Y/N a high-five in return as Dean scowled at both of them.      “You’re both assholes” He grumbled rolling his eyes in defeat. “Whatever what do you got on the case?” Dean changes the subject while dipping his fries in ketchup. His arm draped around the back of y/n’s side of the booth as she propped her elbows on the table leaning forward sipping her soda. “Architect Sean Boyden plummeted to his death for the roof of his home a condominium he designed” Sam read from the newspaper.     “Hmm build a high rise and jump off the top of it. Classy” Y/N commented. Sam snorts at her rebuttal. “When did he call Animal Control?” Dean asks. “Two days earlier” Sam responds. “Did he actually say black dog?” Y/N asks before Sam nods. “Yeah. Vicious wild black dog. The authorities couldn’t find it no one else saw it” Sam quotes from the report.      “In fact the authorities are a little confused as to how a wild dog could get past the doorman take the elevator up and roam the halls of the cushiest joint in town” Sam mumbles with sass. Dean and Y/N’s eyebrows knitted. “After that he doesn’t show up for work. Two days later he takes a swan dive” Sam informs them. “You guys think we’re dealing with an actual black dog?” Dean asks.     “Well maybe” Sam shrugs handing y/n the papers he printed of his research. “What’s the lore in it?” Y/N chimes in taking the papers. “It’s all pretty vague. I mean there’s spectral black dogs all over the world. But some say they’re animal spirits others say death omens” Sam explains to them. Dean peers over y/n shoulder leaning in to take a look at the picture of the black dog along reading some of the information.     “But anyways whatever they are they’re big nasty-” Sam continues but Dean cuts him off “Yeah I bet they can jump the crap out of your leg. Look at that one. Huh?” Dean chuckles taking the picture from y/n to turn it to Sam while wiggling his eyebrows suggestively. Y/N snickers at his joke as Sam shoots Dean an unamused dry look. “What? They could?” Dean mumbles his face dropping. “Is sex all you ever think about?” Y/N snorts rolling her eyes.     Y/N soon realized what she said as a wicked smirk creeps onto Deans face. His mouth was already open to shot her a comeback but Sam and Y/N interrupt him. “Don’t answer that!” They shoot back in unison making Deans mouth snap shut but the smirk still played on his lips as he eyed y/n up and down.        ________________________________        “So you and Sean Boyden were business partners for almost 10 years now right?” Y/N asks Mr. Disalvo they were now over at his house interviewing him posing as journalists. Dressed in pressed shirts and ties while y/n sported her favorite white blouse and pencil skirt. “That’s right. One more time me this is for—?” Disalvo responds confirming their reasoning for the interview. “A tribute for Mr. Boyden. Architectural Digest” Dean responds fluidly with a smile.     Disalvo laughs at this earning confused looks from the three hunters. “This funny to you?”’ Dean asks. “No. It’s just a- Tribute. Yeah” He shakes his head sounding a bit bitter. He leaned against his kitchen island arms cross over his chest. “See. Sean always got the tributes. He kills himself leaves me and his family behind but he gets another tribute” Disalvo scoffs.     The three share a look “Right. Any idea why he’d do such a thing?” Sam asks. “I have no clue. I mean he lived the charmed life.” Disalvo shrugs. “How so?” Y/N asks her eyebrows furrowed as Sam looked down at his notepad while Dean stuffed his hands into his pockets. “He was a flat-out genius. I mean I’m capable but next to him…uh..” Disalvo sighs shaking his head. “It wasn’t always that way either.” He added.     “No?” Dean questions. “Wanna know the truth?” Disalvo begins before taking a breath. “There was time when he couldn’t even design a pup tent. Hell 10 years ago he worked as a bartender at this place called Lloyds. Complete dive” Disalvo explained a bit of disgust on his face. “Right. So what changed?” Sam asks. Disalvo scoffs “You got me. But overnight he gets this huge commission and he starts designing…” He continues as they listen intently.     “He starts designing the most ingenious buildings anyone has ever seen. It was like the level of Van Gogh and Mozart-” Disalvo says exasperatedly stopping abruptly “What?” Dean asks. “It’s funny. True geniuses they seem to die young don’t they?” Disalvo comments as Deans eyes glance over at Sam and Y/N who seem to be indulged in what he’s saying.     “To have that kind of talent. Why? Why just throw it away?” He scoffs shaking his head in disbelief. The three share a look at this revelation.        ________________________________        Later that day y/n exits the Animal Control Agency Shelter with a file in her hands while the boys waited in the Impala. She hopped in the backseat shutting the door as Sam asks “So?” He queries about what she found out. Y/N smirks “The secretary’s name is Carly. She’s 23 she kayaks and she’s…” She lets out a low wolf whistles chuckling as she shook her head thinking back to the brief flirtation she had with the secretary.     Dean rolls his eyes that burning feeling in his chest raising as she shakes her head cockily her cheeks a tinge of pink. Sam snorts amused by this “You didn’t happen to ask her if she’d seen any black dogs lately? Did ya?” Dean scoffs “I’m a professional charming” She counters with a sly smile leaning forward between the boys to show them the file in her hands.     “Every complaint called in this week about big black or dog-like. There’s 19 calls in all” She tells them as Sam opens the file. “And uh….I don’t know what this thing is” Y/N mutters pulling out the yellow sticky note that was stuck to the inside of the file. Sam takes it from her letting out an amused chuckle “You mean Carly’s MySpace address?” Sam chuckles ironically earning confused looks from Dean and Y/N.     “MySpace?” They ask in unison completely in the dark both eyebrows knitted together. Sam just laughs even more at their lack of knowledge about social media. “Seriously is that like some sort of porn site?” Dean asks a bit amused Sam is in full on hysterics at this point while Y/N is still confused.        ________________________________        After at least a dozen houses they were all fed up. They approached another rather large house from the list of addresses Y/N knocks on its door letting out a frustrated sigh. “I swear if this is another fucking Pomeranian barking in the neighbor’s yard…” Dean mutters annoyed getting interrupted when the door opened revealing a woman of Filipino descent.      “Afternoon ma&#x27;am” Dean greets politely covering up his annoyance before taking his fake ID out of his jacket. “Animal Control” He smiles. “Um. Somebody already came yesterday” The woman shakes her head smiling in return. “Oh we’re just following up” Sam says politely. “We’re looking for a Dr. Sylvia Pearlman” Y/N smiles sweetly. The woman looks between the three before nodding.        -        “The doctor. Well- she…I don’t know exactly when she’ll be back. She left two days ago” The woman explains to them after letting them into the house now in the kitchen. “Okay and you are?” Y/N asks. “I’m Miss Pearlman’s maid” The woman responds. “So where did the doctor go?” Dean asks. “I’m not sure. She just packed and went. She didn’t say where” The maid informs them. “That stray dog did you find it finally?” She asks them.     “No. Not yet.” Sam shook his head as as Deans eyes scanned the place before asking “You know you didn’t ever happen to see the dog yourself did you?” Sam smiles “Well no. I never even heard it. I was starting to think the doctor was imagining it” The maid admits. Deans eyes land on a photo of three woman on the fridge seemingly in a bar. Assuming one is the doctor.     He pulled it off of the magnet “But she’s not like that…so..” The maid smiles shaking her head. “You know I read she was uh chief surgeon at her hospital.” Dean chimes in the maid nods in confirmation. “She’s gotta what 42? 42? That’s pretty young for that job” Dean says casually raising his eyebrows. “Youngest in the history of the place. She got the position 10 years ago” The maid informs them.     Sam and Y/N share a look at his their eyebrows raised simultaneously at this “Huh. An overnight success 10 years ago” Y/N chuckles ironically looking over at Dean. “Yeah we know a guy like that.” Dean comments before showing them the photo. “Huh look at this” Dean then turnt the photo around to show them the back written in was ‘Lloyd’s Bar. November 1996’.     Their mouths fell open the dots slowly connecting before recuperating quickly as Y/N took the picture from him.         ________________________________        Dean pulled up to Lloyd’s Bar which was stationed at a crossroads Sam in the passenger side with y/n lounging in the back. They all simultaneously got out the creaking of the almost 40 year old car door echoing through the empty quiet road despite being board daylight.     Deans eyes drift over to a familiar looking yellow plant growing at each of the four corners of the crossroad. “Hey” He stopped the two as they walked besides him. “Yeah?” “What?” Sam and Y/N answered at the same time. “That’s weird” Dean commented. “What?” Y/N asked curiously. “You think someone planted these?” Dean queries walking towards one of the corners ruffling it with his foot.     Y/N instantly recognized the flowers “In the middle of all these weeds?” Sam scoffed as they followed behind him. “These are what do you call them?” Dean asked. “Yarrow flowers” Y/N told him. “Yeah. Used for certain rituals aren’t they?” Dean points out. Sam and Y/N get where he’s hunting at. “Yeah actually summoning rituals” Sam points out a tone of recognition in his voice.     Dean scoffs a chuckle “So two people become sudden successes about 10 years ago right around the third me they were hanging out here at Lloyd’s.” Dean starts. “Where there just happened to be a crossroads. You fellas think?” Y/N added raising an eyebrow at the brothers. The two shrugged “Let’s find out” Dean says before walking to the middle of the road.     Sam and Y/N followed standing side by side the elder Winchester. “This seem about the dead center to you guys?” He asks Y/N gestures for him to give her his keys which he does before walking over to the Impala unlocking the trunk and getting out a shovel. She tosses Dean his keys back from a distance before the two brothers got out of the y/n.     Right where they were standing y/n began digging a hole at the center of the gravelly road. “Yahtzee” She huffed when she hit something hard. Dean then stooped besides her along with Sam getting his hands into the hole dusting it away before pulling out the metal box y/n hit. He dusted off the top the opening it to reveal bones a jar of dirt and a picture.     Dean eyes widen slightly in recognition as Sam took out the jar of dirt “I’d be willing to bet that’s graveyard dirt” Sam commented as he examined the jar “And a black cat bone” Y/N added with a huff taking up one of the bones from the box as she grimaced before Sam tossed the jar back into the box along with her tossing the bone back into it.     “That’s serious spell work. I mean that’s Deep South hoodoo stuff” Dean commented. “Used to summon a demon” Sam adds. “Not just summon one.” Dean starts getting up from the ground. “Crossroads are where pacts are made. These people are actually making deals with the damn thing” He scoffed as Sam and Y/N got up along with him. “Yeah because that always ends good” Y/N said sarcastically rolling her eyes.     “They’re seeing dogs alright. But not black dogs they’re seeing hellhounds” Sam says in realization stuffing his hands into his pocket. This makes Dean and Y/N’s eyes widen. “Demonic pit bulls” Y/N mutters as Sam nods in confirmation. “And whoever this demon is it’s back and it’s collecting.” Dean also realized shaking his head. “And that doctor lady where ever she’s running….she ain’t running fast enough” Y/N shook her head also.        ________________________________        Rosendale Mississippi   •1930        Robert Johnson knelt dead center at the crossroads burying his brown satchel with the items to summon the crossroads demon. He got up dusting his hands off waiting patiently. He felt a presence behind him only to turn around to be met with a beautiful woman. “Holy-” He gasped initially shocked. “Holy? Guess again” the young woman smirked her eyes glassing over a flash of red. Her tone was enticing as she slowly approached Robert.     Her white gown hung neatly off her curves “I wanna play guitar. I want you to make me the best blues man ever lived” Robert got straight to the point. The woman smiled wickedly resting her hand on Robert cheek. “If that’s what you want” She said in a sultry tone. Her eyes glancing down to his lips. “So how do you-? Do we shake on it?” He asked innocently.      The woman chuckled darkly before grabbing Robert by both sides of his face before kissing him. Sealing the deal and claiming his soul as his own. She slowly let go as Robert kept his eyes closed. He took a deep breath only to open his eyes to see the woman had disappeared. Gone into the wind.     He then turned his guitar that was hung over his shoulder around a sinking feeling in his chest. Wondering if he just made the biggest mistake of his life.        ________________________________        “So it’s just like the Robert Johnson legend right? I mean selling your soul at the crossroads kind of deal” Sam asked curiously the three still stood at the crossroads. “Yeah except that wasn’t a legend. You know his music” Dean responded as Sam shrugged. “You don’t know Robert Johnson’s songs?” Y/N’s eyes widen along with Dean’s as Sam shook his head.     “Sam there’s occult references all over his lyrics. I mean: &#x27;Cross Road Blues’ &#x27;Me and the Devil Blues’ &#x27;Hell Hound on My Trail’” Y/N listed off as Sam still remained confused. “Damn who raised you?” Dean muttered in disappointment. Sam rolled his eyes huffing back a chuckle as Y/N snorts at Deans comment. “Story goes that he died choking on his own blood. He was hallucinating and muttering about big evil dogs” Dean added to y/n’s point as she nodded.     “And now it’s happening all over again” Sam said. “Yep” Y/N responded “We gotta find out if anyone else struck any bargains around here” She added. “Great. So we gotta clean up these peoples mess for em? I mean they’re not exactly squeaky clean. Nobody put a gun to their head and forced them to play &#x27;Let’s Make a Deal’ ” Dean scoffed pointing out the obvious. The two younger hunters raised their eyebrows at Deans blatant disregard.      It was their job to save people it was what they were trained to do. So Dean’s disregard surprised them.     “So what? We should just leave them?” Sam scoffed in return defensively. “Someone goes over Niagara in a barrel you gonna jump in to try and save em?” Dean asked rhetorically with a bit of snark “Dean!” Y/N lowly exclaimed giving him a pleading look. Dean rolled his eyes at her tone before making eye contact with her the plea in her eyes brought him to a puddle. “Alright fine” Dean groaned obliging.     Sam smirked lightly at this but covered it up y/n gave Dean a cheeky grateful smile. “Rituals like this you put your own photo into the mix right? So..” Dean began taking out the picture of an African-American man from the box that was buried in the center of the crossroads. “This guy probably summoned the thing. We’ll go see if anyone inside knows him” Dean stated nudging Y/N.     She nodded “If he’s still alive” Dean added sarcastically warning an eyeroll from y/n and Sam as the two walked to the bar. Leaving Sam in the middle of the crossroads.        ________________________________        “What’s this guys name again?” Sam asks them as they made their way up the stairs to the ratty old apartment building of the man they found in the box. “George Darrow. Apparently quite the regular at Lloyd’s” Dean informs him. “Guess his house probably isn’t up next in MTV Cribs is it?” Y/N chimes in ironically. “Yeah so whatever deal he made…” Sam agreed “It wasnt for cash” Dean finishes his thought.     “Oh who knows? Maybe his place is full of babes in Princess Leia bikinis?” Dean suggests with a smirk gesturing with his hands over his chest flashing y/n a wink. She snorts with a roll of her eyes as Sam shakes his head in dissaproval “Could you be serious for once?” She chuckles. Dean put his hands up in mock surrender chuckling “I’m just saying this guys got one epic bill come due. I hope at least he asked for something fun” He shrugged as they made their way to the fourth floor.     They finally reached in-front of Apartment 4C Y/N notices some kind of dust on the floor and points at it “Look at that” She drew the boys attention to it. The three stooped infront of the door dusting their fingers on the dark grainy substance “What is that pepper?” Dean queries. Then suddenly the door opened shocking them all.     The three quickly got up and straightened their postures. At the door was George Darrow seemingly 10 years older than he was in the picture. “Who the hell are you?” George asks them suspiciously his voice gruff and hostile as he eyed the three. “George Darrow?” Y/N asked in a sweet tone. He glared at her before saying “I’m not buying anything sugar” He snapped before going to close the door but Dean stopped him.     “Woah woah woah. Looks like you went for the wrong shaker there” He quipped with a chuckle. George looked at him confused glancing down at the dust in the ground “Usually when you wanna keep something evil out you go for the salt” Y/N added with a tinge amusement. George was dumbfounded “I don’t know what you’re talking about” George’s denied his eyes narrowed at them.     “We’re talking about this” Dean responded for her pulling out George’s picture from his picture holding it up to show him. George’s face glassed over with fear “Tell me you seen that hellhound yet?” Dean snarked earning a side eye from y/n. “Look we wanna help. Please just five minutes” Sam pleaded in a gentle tone.      -     Blues music played over the radio as George poured himself a drink the three hunters now inside of his apartment stock piled with nicknacks and paintings. “So what is that stuff out front?” Y/N asked curiously. “Goofer dust.” George responded taking a gulp of his whiskey. The three shared a confused look having never heard of such a thing.      “Oh you guys think you know something about something but not goofer dust?” George scoffed roughly resting down his glass before tossing Dean a tiny brown bag Dean instinctively catches it. “Well we know a little about alot of things. Just enough to make us dangerous” Dean quipped back with a shrug. “What is it?” Sam asked as Dean examined the bag.      “Hoodoo. My grandma taught me. Keeps out demons” George responds. Dean chuckles at this looking down at the bag of dust “Demons we know” Dean nods. “Well then. Keep it. Maybe it’ll do you some good” George roughly says picking up his bottle of whiskey and glass before walking over to his single couch. “Four minutes left” George says before taking a large gulp of his whiskey.     Sam and Y/N shared a look at this how defeated George sounded “Mr. Darrow we know you’re in trouble” Y/N begins sympathetically. “Yeah that you got yourself into” Dean muttered earning a glare from Sam and a smack in the arm from y/n. “Ow!” Dean grumbles rubbing his arm. “Don’t make me put you in a corner” She pointed at him as if he were a child earning a defeated sigh from him and a pout.     “But it’s not hopeless alright? There’s gonna be something we can do” Sam says with an encouraging tone “Listen” George sighs taking a seat on his couch. “I get that you guys wanna help. But sometimes a person makes their bed and they just got to lie down in it” George puts it simply the three look at him as he speaks ass their hands stuffed into their jacket pockets.     “I’m the one who called that demon in the first place” George grumbles sipping from his glass of whiskey. “What did you do it for?” Dean asks curiously. “I was weak.” George responds honestly “I mean who don’t wanna be great? Who don’t want their life to mean something?” He states on the verge of tears. “I just- I just never thought about the price” George sighs shakily. “Was it worth it?” Dean asks in a deadpan tone.     “Hell no.” George scoffed. “Of course I asked for talent. Should’ve gone with fame” He chuckled humorlessly. “I’m still broke. And lonely. Just now I got this pile of painting dont nobody want” He shook his head nodding towards the paintings in his apartment. “But that wasn’t the worse…..” Georges trailed off tears in his eyes. “Go on” Sam encourages him.     “Demon didn’t leave. I never counted on that. After our deal was done the damn thing stayed at Lloyd’s for a week just chatting making more deals” George explains angry and frustrated at this. “I tried to warn folks but who’s gonna listen to an old drunk” He scoffed “How many others are there?” Y/N asked. George thought for a second “The architect a doctor lady. I kept up with them. They been in the papers” He told her.     “At least they got famous” He scoffed again before taking a large swig from his whiskey. “Who else George? Come on think” Dean presses. “One more….uh. Nice guy too. Hudson. Evan. I think” George told them after thinking for a second. “I don’t know what he asked for. Don’t matter now. We done for” George smiled no joy whatsoever behind it.     Y/N’s heart dropped “No. No there’s gotta be a way” Sam and Y/N shook their heads. “You don’t get it. I don’t want a way” George snapped resting down his whiskey before getting up. “Look you don’t have-” Sam goes to say but George’s cuts him off. “Look I called that thing! I brought it in myself….I brought it on them” George exclaims his voice cracking at the last part.     “I’m going to hell one way or another” George sobs turning to pick up his whiskey before turning back to them. “All I want is to finish my last painting. A day or two. I’m done. I’m just trying to hold em off till the end. Buy a little time” George says calmly taking a deep breath. “Okay kids. Time you went. Go help somebody that wants help.” George says roughly going over to his painting. “We can’t just-” Sam goes to say.     “Get out! I got work to do!” George screams at him before picking up his paintbrush. Y/N and Sam share a look at this “You don’t really wanna die” She defends “I don’t?” George scoffs but she could see on his face that he’s scared and so can Sam. “I’m- Im tired” George says shakily taking a deep breath. Dean gave Sam and Y/N a look that said &#x27;I told you so’ before they all made their way out as George went back to work on his painting.        ________________________________        Later that night the trio are now walking up the steps to Evan Hudson’s porch having found his address. Y/N raises her knuckles to rap on the wooden door within a couple of seconds a man who seemed to be in his 40’s opened the door looking somewhat panicked “Yes?” The man greeted them. “Evan Hudson?” Sam asks.     “Yeah” Evan confirms with a nod looking a bit confused at the three. “You ever been to a bar called Lloyds?” Y/N asks Evans face dropped with fear at this. “Would’ve been about 10 years ago” Dean added out of the sudden Evan slammed the door locking it behind it. All of their eyes widen at this “Come on we’re not demons” Dean groaned slightly earning annoyed eye-rolls from his brother and friend.     “Any other bright ideas?” Y/N quipped sarcastically Dean smirked before lifting his foot kicking in the door with a heavy grunt. Y/N’s eyebrows shot up at this “Damn okay” She muttered to herself.     That was oddly attractive fuck. She thought to herself oddly turnt on by this but she shoved it to the back of her mind.     They padded into Hudson’s house he ran into a room and locked the door behind him. The three approached the door having seen Evan run into it. Dean raised his foot again to knock it down but Sam stopped him “Wait” giving Dean a look of displease. Y/N internally rolled her eyes kinda hoping to see Dean kick a door in again. She then reached for the handle revealing the door to be unlocked as she twisted the knob.     The three entered the room which seemed to be Evans office “Evan” Y/N called out for him. “Please! Don’t hurt me” Evan pleaded with fear his hands up in surrender as he moved from behind the bookcase. “We’re not gonna hurt you. Alright? We’re here to help you” Sam assured him putting his own hands up in surrender. “We know all about the genius deal you made” Dean said in a deadpan tone.     “What? How?” Evan gasps in surprise “It doesn’t matter. All that matters is we’re trying to stop it” Y/N added. “How do I know you’re not lying?” Evan narrowed his eyes at the three. “Well you don’t but you’re kinda running low on options there buddy boy” Dean quipped earning a side eye from his brother and friend.     Evan took a sharp shaky breath before he began pacing “Can you stop it?” He asks them. “Don’t know. We’ll try” Sam responds honestly as Y/N gave the man a sympathetic look he looked genuinely scared. Then again who wouldn’t be? “I don’t wanna die” Evan sighs heavily wiping the beads of sweat on his forehead.     “Of course you don’t. Not now.” Dean snorts his tone snippy. “Dean. Stop” Sam warned him as y/n glared at him her jaw clenched at his lack of empathy. “What did you ask for anyway. Ey? Huh?” Dean asks curiously Evans eyes snapped over to him. “Never need Viagra? Bowl a perfect game? What?” He sassed as Sam and Y/N shook their heads. “My wife” Evan answers his question despair in his eyes.     Dean laughs at his answer “Right. Getting the girl. That’s worth a trip to hell.” He chuckled ironically as Evan looked down in shame his arms crossed over his chest. “Dean. Stop” Y/N elbowed him in the ribs roughly. Deans amused look drops as she looks at him with disapproval at his behavior “No. He’s right I made the deal” Evan suddenly said walking up closer to them unfolding his arms.     “Nobody twisted my arm. That..uh- woman or whatever she was at the bar- She said I could have anything I wanted. I thought she was nuts at first but—” Evan explains trailing off to take a deep breath. “I don’t know I was….I was desperate” He shook his head turning away from them. Sam and y/n’s eyebrows furrow at this “Desperate?” Y/N asked confused.     Evan walked back over to his table his back turnt to them as he wiped away a tear leaning against it by the palms of his hands “Julie was dying” Evan admitted. Deans heart dropped at this “You did it to save her?” He asked stunned. “She had cancer. They stopped treatment they were moving her into hospice. They kept saying: A matter of days” Evan told his story turning to them again.     “So yeah I made the deal. And I’d do it again. I’d have died for her on the spot” Evan said firmly Sam and Y/N’s hearts have for the man as Dean narrowed his eyes at Evan again “Did you ever think about her is all this?” He asked gruffly jaw clenched “I did this for her” Evan defended. “You sure about that?” Dean scoffed stepping closer to Evan “No I think you did it for yourself. So you wouldn’t have to live without her” Dean called Evan out.     Evan didn’t dare look him in the eyes a lump growing in his throat Deans eyes flickered over to y/n her face doused with concern conflicted because she knew Dean was right. The thought of it being her or Sam in that position instead made his heart squeeze in his chest.     “But guess what she’s gonna have to live without you now. And what if she knew how much it cost? What if she knew it cost your soul? How do you think she’d feel?” Dean put it brutally his mind going back to his father. Y/N placed her hand in his shoulder “Okay that’s enough” She pulled him back as he glared at Evan. “Evan. Sit tight. Alright? We’re gonna figure this out” Sam stepped forward assuring Evan.     Y/N escorted Dean out of the room and into the hall. “You alright charming?” She asked him concerned the emotion that was swimming in his voice when he was talking to Evan struck her like a lightning bolt. Worried for her friend as he turnt to her quickly clearing his throat. “Yeah why would’ve I be?” Dean responded rhetorically feigning a tight smile.     Her eyes searched his not believing him for one second but she decided not to push. “Okay” She nodded offering him a reassuring smile. He was grateful she didn’t push however thinking about his father really got to him. Sam exited the room behind them “Hey I got an idea” Dean said digging the bag George gave him out of the inside of his jacket pocket. “You throw George’s hoodoo at the hellhound. Keep it away from Evan as long as you can” He instructs Sam and Y/N.     “I’m gonna go to the crossroads and summon the demon” He tells them their eyes snap up to him in shock. “Like hell you are!” Y/N snaps at him her jaw clenched tightly. Deans eyebrows shot up at this “What are you? Nuts?!” Sam exclaims lowly. “Maybe a little” Dean shrugs with a click of his tongue. “But I can trap it. I can exorcise it and I can buy is time to figure out something more permanent” Dean defends.     “Yeah but how much time?” Sam retorts. “I don’t know. A while. I mean It’s not easy for those evil suckers to slaw their way back from hell and into the sunshine” He chuckled a bit at the last part. “No. No way” Y/N shook her head not okay with this plan. “I’m with y/n on this it’s suicide” Sam agrees. “You’re not allowed guys unless you’ve got better ideas” Dean retorts with a smirk.     “Dean. You can forget it alright? We’re not letting you summon that demon” Y/N said firmly. “Why not?” Dean scoffed. “Because I don’t like where you head is at right now that’s why not!” Y/N snaps back as Deans eyebrows furrowed with feigned confusion. “What are you talking about?” Dean rolled his eyes. “You know you’ve been on edge ever since we found that crossroads Dean. And I think I know why” Sam calls Dean out on his bullshit.     “You know we don’t have time for it” Dean huffed moving to walk away. Y/N snatched him by his arm stopping him. “John” She stated. Dean holted in his tracks a look of despair on his face at the mention of his father. “You think maybe Dad made one of these deals huh?” Sam says what’s on everyone’s mind. Y/N let’s go of Deans arm as he turns back to them “Hell I’ve been thinking it. I’m sure you two have been thinking it too” He puts it with pure honesty.     Tears welling up in his eyes as he gestures to his brother and best friend. Y/N’s eyes were attached to the floor as Dean gulped “It fits doesn’t it? I’m alive Dads dead. Yellow eyed demon was involved.” Dean croaks swallowing another lump in his throat. His eyes burned tears ready to make its way out of his ducts. Y/N’s heart ached at his expression she couldn’t begin the fathom the guilt he felt.     “What if he did? What if he struck a deal? My life for his soul?” Dean questioned his jaw clenched as he tried to hold back his tears neither Sam or y/n could answer. The two brothers sharing a tearful gaze. While Y/N glanced back down at the ground to stop her own tears from falling because of how much it ached her to see Dean so hurt. “I think I hear it. It’s outside” Evans voice echos from the room breaking their sorrow filled silence.      “Just keep him alive okay?” Dean says to Sam and y/n firmly. “I’m coming with you” Y/N shook her head. “What? No you’re n-” Dean tried to protest but y/n shut him down. “Don’t even try it Winchester. I’m going with you” Y/N pointed a finger at his chest firmly as she stepped closer to him. Both of them were now only a few inches away from each others face their chests rising and falling.     Sam stayed silent beside them knowing if he spoke they’d probably rip his head off.     “It’s not up for discussion” Deans jaw clenched again. “You wanna bet sweetie?” Y/N sneered as both of their eyes stared into each others like they were holding a private conversation with just their eyes. They both knew they weren’t going to let it go until one of them gave in first. Sam was looking back and forth between the pair knowing this will get ugly fast.     Deans eyes softened slightly with defeat he knew there was no way of fighting an argument against her. “Dammit Y/N” He sighs in defeat. He really did hate the way she makes him so weak for her that just a look from her could make him do anything she wanted. The two gave Sam a quick nod before leaving the house. “Dean Y/N” Sam called out to them.     “Go!” They yelled pointing to the room door as Sam sighed in defeat worried out of his ass.        ________________________________        “I don’t care what you say I’m summoning it!” Y/N argued as the duo made their way to the crossroads. Both arguing about who should summon the demon. “Like hell you are!” He growled gripping his steering wheel. “Give me one reason why I shouldn’t?” Y/N challenged. “Because I said so” Dean muttered as he kept his eyes focused on the road.     “Seriously?” Y/N said with a scoff as she rolled her eyes at his childish reasoning. “It would make more sense Dean! If John….did what he did…” She chose her words carefully Dean’s chest burned with sorrow. “Demons probably talk they would be expecting you. Me on the other hand I’m a wild card. They wouldn’t call it” She defended he sighed knowing she was right.     “For fucks sake princess” He cursed again at the realization of being beat yet again. Y/N smirked victoriously arms crossed over her chest knowing she won the argument for now.        -        Y/N knelt at the middle of the crossroads the box in her left hand with the graveyard dirt and black cat bone. Her real ID was in her other hand now placing it into the box. Snapping it shut she places it into the hole using her hands to scoop the dirt over the box burying it. Dean was no longer in the Impala hidden away in the darkness behind some bushes watching as y/n took the last step in summoning the demon.     His heart was beating out of his ass as he watched her get up from off her knees her eyes scanning the dark crossroad. A familiar heat in the back of her neck raised indicating to her that the demon was behind her. “So what brings a girl like you to a place like this?” A beautiful woman quips up from behind y/n as she turnt her head to her.     Y/N’s eyes subtly scanned the girls frame “You called me?” The demon smiled wickedly “I’m just glad it worked” Y/N flashed the demon a coy smile putting on her charm. Allowing her eyes to roam down the demons curves she internally cursed herself for being attracted to her but kept the plan in mind.      “First time?” The demon teased “You could say that” Y/N responded with faux-fear swallowing nothing in her throat. “Oh come on now. Don’t sell yourself short.” The demon smirked stepping closer to y/n. “I know all about you Y/N L/N” The demon called her out on her bullshit her eyes glassing over flashing to a ball of red. She quirked her eyebrow as she smirked at y/n.      Y/N was taken back by this but quickly recovered. “So you know who I am?” Y/N cocked her eyebrow allowing her own eyes to flash into the ball of white like she normally did when using her powers before reverting it back to her regular (e/c) ones. “I get the newsletter” The demon shrugged “And I know all about your two scary dogs Sam and Dean Winchester” The demon added in a snide tone earning a glare from y/n.     Deans breath hitched from the distance he was at still undetected by the demon. He was still in earshot so he heard every word. “Scary dogs?” Dean muttered lowly to himself confused at this.     “Well don’t keep me in suspense” Y/N covered up her hatred with a lustful look. Taking a step closer to the demon “What have you heard?” She asked as she tucked her bottom lip in between her teeth feigning a confused look as she furrowed her eyebrows her eyes scanning the demons frame again. “Well I heard you were gorgeous but…” The demon begins in a sultry tone getting into y/n’s personal space.     “…but you’re just edible. Quite ravishing” The demon gasps in a low tone. Y/N would be lying if she said that didn’t boast her ego just a smidge “What can I do for you Y/N?” The demon smirked widely. The eye contact they held was intense almost piercing into each other. Y/N licked her bottom lip “Maybe we should do this in my friends car? Nice and private” Y/N suggests in a seductive tone a glint of mischief in her eyes.     “Sounds good to me” The demon agrees lustfilled not breaking eye contact with the hunter as they walked back to the Impala.        -        Meanwhile back at Evans house. Sam was lining the doors and windows with the goofer dust. Moving over to Evan who was stood in the middle of the room with his arms crossed over his chest now beginning to make a circle around him on the ground with the dust. “What is that stuff?” Evan questioned. “Goofer dust” Sam answered. “You serious?” Evan asked bamboozled.     “Yeah. Afraid so” Sam lightly chuckled not blaming Evan for his reaction. “Look believe me don’t believe me. Whatever you want. Just whatever you do stay in this circle alright?” Sam ordered him firmly his tone warning.        -        Back at the crossroad “So I was hoping we could strike a deal” Y/N said to the demon her arms buried in her jacket pocket as they walk back to the Impala. “That’s what I do” The demon chimed. “I want Evan Hudson released from his contract” Y/N said. The demon hummed “So sorry darling. That’s not negotiable” The demon shook her head. “I’ll make it worth your while” Y/N countered.     “Oh really? What are you offering?” The demon asked intrigued. “Me.” Y/N stated walking forward before turning to face the demon with a stoic expression. “Well well well” The demon giggled not expecting that. “You’d sacrifice your life for someone else’s?” The demon smirked. “Like father like daughter” She shot at y/n this made her heart sink into the gravelly road at the mention of her dad.           Even Dean felt that pain by just hearing it.           “Your Winchester is showing Y/N” The demon added with snide in a sing-song tone. “You did know about Daddy Winchester’s deal right? His life for Deans?” The demon mocked as Y/N’s jaw clenched.           Now that one rocked Dean and it shot y/n in her chest. It took everything in him not to get out from behind the bushes and shove her into his car himself.           “Now I didn’t make the deal myself but boy I wish I had” The demon further tormented y/n not aware of Deans presence.           He rolled his tongue over his teeth as tears stung in his eyes.           Y/N however she held it together a flash of hatred over her eyes before covering it up with lust. She opened the passenger side door “After you” She smirked holding her burning desire to nail the bitch to the cross “Such hospitality” The demon complimented she went to move into the car but stopped in her tracks when she saw the devils trap spray-painted into the ground on the road below the car.     Her gaze snapping over to y/n with anger “A devils trap? You’ve got to be kidding me” The demon growled.        -        Back at the house Evan heard growling behind him. He spun around to see no one there but the growling didn’t subside “What?” Sam asked concerned looking in the same direction as Evan “You hear that?” Evan asked “No where?” Sam responded. The growling then started coming from the door “Right outside the door” Evan said fearfully pointing to the door.     The growling subsided for a second as Sam looked over but then the doors started banging Sam jumped quickly stepping into the circle. Their chest heaved with fear as the banging continued. “Just don’t move alright? Stay where you are” Sam instructed Evan who nodded scared for his life as the doors continued to bang inwards.        -        Back at the crossroad “You stupid stupid-” The demon growled slamming the Impala door harshly. “I should rip you limb from limb” She sneered with anger moving closer towards y/n who walked backwards a cocky smirk on her face “Take your best shot baby.” Y/N said enticingly attempting to lure the demon into the devils trap but she stopped in her tracks.     “No. I don’t think so” She suddenly said making Y/N’s eyes widen and Dean’s heart stop. “I’m not gonna put you out of your misery.” The demon huffed. “Yeah? Why not?” Y/N scoffed. “Because your misery is the whole point. Though killing you will hurt the Winchesters letting you live is much more fun to watch.” The demon moved closer as y/n’s heart beat out of her chest.     “Knowing how your daddy died for you saving you from that vampire. Knowing it’s your fault” She sneered y/n had tears welling up in her eyes as her mind flashed back to that unfaithful night. “           Dean gritted his teeth with anger grief pain. You name it he was feeling it.           &quot;Now knowing how daddy Winchester died and sold his soul for his boy.” The demon giggled sickeningly. “I mean that’s gotta hurt. And it’s gonna hurt your boytoy when you tell him about his fathers deal to save his sorry ass” She referred to Dean as she moved closer to y/n backing her up against the leg of a wooden water than stand.     “Your fathers are all you ever think about. You wake up and your first thought is &#x27;I can’t do this anymore’. You’re all lit up with pain. I mean you loved him so much” She gutted y/n with her lethal words.     “You blew it y/n. I could’ve given you want you need” She cackled. “What do I need?” Y/N gritted her teeth at the demon. “Your fathers. I could’ve brought them back.” She smirked as y/n’s eyes widen. “Your loss. See you y/n I wish you and the Winchester boys a nice long live” She sneered before going to walk off. Y/N stood frozen for a second her eyes darted over to Dean who was crouched by the bushes.           Dean shook his head telling her to abandon the plan with his eyes but she didn’t listen. Putting up a finger in a way of saying &#x27;Stay there’ indicating she had an idea. Dean huffed in annoyance but listened to her.           “Hold on.” She called out to the demon.        -        Back at the house the hellhounds are banging furiously at the door as Sam and Evan shook with fear before stopping out of the sudden. “Do you still hear it?” Sam asked Evan as they looked around. Evan shook his head “No. Is it over?” He asked. Evan then heard the growling coming from the vent his head snapping over to that direction. The vent window then caved it hitting the chair infront of it as an invisible force being the hellhounds broke it open. “It’s here!” Evan screamed.        -        Back at the crossroad “You’re lucky I’ve got a soft spot for lost puppies and beautiful faces” The demon walked back over to y/n. “I just can’t leave you like this” She smirked leaning against the wooden water tank stand y/n was under. “Besides you didn’t call me here to bargain for Evan. Not really” The demon narrowed her eyes at y/n her tone sly. “Can you bring them back? My dad and John?” Y/N asked pretending to consider the offer.     “Of course I can. Just as they were.” The demon smiled “Your dads would live long natural lives…like they were meant to. That’s a promise” The demon smirked.            Dean now understood what y/n was doing so he kept still where he was. Trusting she knew what she was doing.           “What about me?” Y/N asked looking down. “I can give you 10 years. Ten long good years with them. That’s a lifetime” The demon said enticingly. “Your families can be together again. John Dean Sammy F/N Y/N/N. The Winchester boys and the L/N’s all reunited” The demon tried to sell her the deal attempting to lure y/n in with her promise.     Y/N took a deep breath as the demon stepped closer to her resting her hand on y/n’s chest. “Look your dad is supposed to be alive. You’re supposed to be dead had he not saved you. This would just set things straight. Put things back in their natural order. And you get 10 extra years ontop” She continued to promise y/n.     Leaning in closer to seal the deal her lips inches away from y/n’s. “That’s a bonus” She whispered brushing her lips over y/n’s. Her breathing hitched as the demon did this but she did not intend on doing so because she already got what she wanted.     Though deep down the deal sounded enticing. She wanted to take it but she couldn’t admit it to herself she wanted her dad back. She wanted John alive. She wanted her family back. But it’s not what she needed.           Dean looked on he could see the hesitation on her face. Hoping it was just an act to lure the demon in “Come on baby. Don’t fall for it&quot;He whispered to himself.           Y/N then walked out from under the water tank &quot;You think you could….” She began with a fake consideration before turning to face the demon with a smug look. “….throw in a set of steak knives” She quipped with sarcasm.           Dean smirked from the distance in victory. “Atta girl” He muttered to himself proudly.           The demon huffed chuckling at this “You know this smart ass self-defense mechanism of your-” The demon chuckled humorlessly moving to step out from under the tank.     She stopped in her tracks her sentence cutting short. Her eyes flickered above the wooden tank to see a devils trap spray painted into it. “Now you’re really trapped” Dean chimed in from behind y/n revealing himself to the demon who snarled at them. Y/N looked back at her friend thankful he trusted her when she said to stay out. “Y/N. Dean…” The demon growled. “Thats gotta hurt” Dean snapped back at the demon.     “Now I may swing that way but I’m not kissing a slimy bitch like you” Y/N narrowed her eyes at the demon her hands buried in her jacket pocket as Dean stood by her side. “Let me our now!” The demon snapped. “Sure. We just gotta make a little deal here first” Y/N quipped mocking the demons tone of their entire interaction.     “You call off your hellhound let Evan go. Then we’ll let you go” Dean listed his demands as he and y/n walked around the water tank. “I can’t break a binding contract” The demon informs them. “Hmm. And by &#x27;can’t’ you mean &#x27;don’t want to’?” Y/N shot back with sass. Dean raised his eyebrows at the demon. “Last chance. Evan and his wife get to live to a ripe old age” Dean said.     “Going going…” Y/N said as if she were in an auction. “Let’s talk about this” The demon pleaded. “Okay. Gone” Dean snapped before taking out his fathers journal.        -        Back at the house “Stay inside the circle!” Sam ordered Evan as the barking grew louder shielding him with his body. The barking started coming from all around them the hellhounds then started to claw at the wooden ground around the circle marking the floor snarling as Sam shielded Evan. “Come in guys.” Sam pleaded to himself Dean and Y/N would get him out of this.        -        Back at the crossroad “What are you doing?” The demon asked fearfully as Dean flipped through Johns journal. “Oh you’re gonna go on a little trip” He smirked at the demon “Way down south” Y/N added with snark as she took her rosary out of her jacket pocket the one she had been clutching onto the entire time. “Look forget Evan. Think of your dads.” The demon pleaded. Dean and Y/N scoffed at her desperation she then put her hand up offering it to Dean.     He took it without hesitation clasping his hand over hers as they started chanting in Latin. “Exorcizamus te omnis immundus spiritus omnis satanica potestas. Omnis incursio infernalis adversii omnis congregatio et secta diabolica.” The demon began to gasp and twitch as they exorcised her.         -        Back at the house the hellhounds began growling louder the windows to the room bursted open as paper flew around. The wind increasing in the room the goofer dust began to fade slower and slower until it broke. “Circles broken! Come on!” Sam yelled pulling Evan out of the room.        -        Back at the crossroad the demon was gripping onto the body she was possessing for dear life “Ergo draco maledicte ecclesiam tuam securi tibi faci-” Dean and y/n continued only to be cut off “Wait!” The demon pleaded reaching out for y/n. She gripped the hunter by the collar of her jacket and pulled her in for a rough kiss.     It was harsh and demanding her hands gripped onto the demons shoulders before making way up to her hair tangling into her dark locks as their lips molded against each others. Deans jaw dropped at what he was witnessing. John’s journal slipped from his clutches.        -        Sam and Evan rushed out the room running down the hall as the hellhounds ran behind them. Evan opened the door to a linen closet both rushing in as Sam locked the door quickly behind him bracing his back against it. The hellhounds banged heavily on the door. Sam grunted trying to hold them back. But then the barking and banging stopped out of the sudden confusing both of them as their heavy breaths filled the room.        -        Back at the crossroads the taste of anger mingled in their kiss each battling for dominance over the other. Before y/n pulled away roughly eating her words from earlier when she said she’d never kiss the demon. “What the fuck was that for?” Y/N grunted as the demon pushed her away wiping out the spit that coated her lips. “Sealing the deal” The demon responded.      Deans jaw was still on the ground not knowing what in the holy fuck just happened. “You know I usually like to be warned before I’m violated with demon tongue” Y/N quipped back. “Evan Hudson is free. He and his wife will live long lives.” The demon told them. “How do we know you’re not lying?” Dean finally snapped out of his daze his words snippy.      “My word is my bond.” The demon smirked. “Oh really?” Y/N scoffed sarcastically. “It is when I make a deal. It’s the rules” The demon simply put it Dean and Y/N shared a look at her words. Y/N swallowed the lump in her throat when she was met with Deans gaze a bit of guilt raising in her. “Now let me go” The demon ordered.      Y/N glanced up at the trap looking over to Dean who was picking up his fathers journal from the ground. He then reached over to grip her hand pulling her out of the trap. Their hands clutched onto each others as y/n’s grip tightened on her rosary they both held smirks on their face as she headed the rosary in her hand.     “You’re gonna double-cross me?” The demon scoffed realizing they’re gonna exorcise her anyways. “Funny over I’m the trustworthy one” The demon quipped the hunters just shrugged at this. The demons gaze snapped over to y/n “You know you renege send me to hell. Then sooner or later I’m gonna climb out and skinning Evan Hudson will be the first thing that I do” The demon threatened.      Dean and Y/N don’t allow their smirks to falter both looking back at each other. They shared a silent conversation with their eyes for a couple of seconds before y/n took her hand out of Dean who then stuffed his fathers journal into his jacket. “Todays your lucky day sweetheart” Y/N sneered at her as Dean climbed the side of the tank.     Pulling out one of the wood the trap was painted on rendering its effectiveness null. The demon walked out past y/n turning to her as Dean climbed back down. “I gotta tell you. You two would’ve never pulled that stunt if you knew” She said enticingly. “Knew what?” Dean rolled his eyes. “Where your dads are.” She smirked causing their hearts to drop. “You should’ve made that deal.” She added in a snide tone.     Their blood boiled all the color draining from Dean’s face. “Impossible” Y/N growled not wanting to believe it. “Oh trust me sexy” The demon smirked. “Your daddy may have died for you selflessly but he had a longggg list of enemies who paid big money to see him in the pit” She stated with snark as Y/N’s nails dug into her palms.     “Imagine our joy when we saw him turnt up at our doorstep. And then Johnny boy came tumbling down after having sent himself down on his own” The demon giggled sadistically. Dean and Y/N didn’t say a word the information they were begging weren’t true turnt out to be just that. The plain truth.     “See people talk about hell but it’s just a word. It doesn’t even come close to describing the real thing” The demon continued to torment them. “Shut your mouth bitch” Dean snapped. “If you could see your poor daddies hear the sounds they make because they can’t even scream” She added with a sadistic undertone. This made them snap Y/N waved her hand sending the demon stumbling back falling ass first as her eyes flashed over a ball of white.     “How &#x27;bout we send you back?! Huh?!” Dean sneered at the demon blood boiling his his vein. Y/N cupped her hands in-front of her her fingers pointed towards the demon. Using her mind she began choking her but she didn’t get a chance to finish the job since demon vomited out a smoke of black escaping the human she was possessing. Y/N stopped her attack loosing the mental grip she had on the girl.     She forgot for a second that the demon was possessing a human cursing herself for hurting an innocent person. “What?” The woman gasped from the floor looking around with fear etched on her face. “How did I get here?” The woman looked up at Dean and Y/N her breathing quickening confused from everything.        ________________________________        The trio were now in the Impala leaving town blues. music were blurring over the radios. They told Sam everything about the encounter from start to end. After that they didn’t utter a word. Still in shock from what they just heard “Demons lie all the time right? Maybe she was lying.” Sam suggested from the back worried to his core as he tried to reassure his brother and best friend.     “Come on man” Y/N mumbled as she brought the flame of her lighter to the tip of her cigarette tucked in between her lips “Is that really what you think?” Dean gritted his teeth his grip tightened on his steering wheel as the ember from y/n’s bud glowed from his peripheral view. The smoke billowing out in a wispy grey steam she she took her first satisfying drag. Sam couldn’t answer “How could he do it? How could they do it?” Dean shook his head.     “They did it for you guys” Sam said quietly trying to comfort the two. “Exactly. How are we supposed to live with that?” Y/N croaked turning to the window.     Tears burned at her eyes again guilt embedded in her. Now know exactly how Dean was feeling the weight of her father and John dying for them and the weight from her concern from Dean sunk in her chest. She took a shaky drag from her cigarette exhaling a plume of smoke. She looked over at Dean as the silence pierced the car.     She offered him the cigarette which he reached over and took graciously in his left hand between his middle finger and thumb. He braced his hand on the window of his door bringing the bud to his lips. He took a deep drag holding it for a couple of seconds allowing the nicotine and tobacco to course through his hot veins and into his lungs before watching the smoke curl into the air. Through his mouth and nose.     “You know the thought of them…” Dean began passing the cigarette back to y/n which she accepted as Sam looked down at his hands with sorrow. “…wherever they are right now. I mean they spent their whole lives chasing that yellow-eyed son of a bitch. They should’ve gone out fighting it. That was supposed to be their legacy you know?” Dean stated honestly his tone filled with anguish.     “Not bargaining with the damn thing. Not some random fucking vampire on a milk run. Not this” Dean added as y/n swallowed the lump in her throat taking a shaky drag again before exhaling it out the window. A single tear. Ran down her right cheek “How maybe people do you think they saved? Total?” Sam attempted to assure them again.     “That’s not the point Sam” Y/N huffed passing Dean the cigarette again both wallowing in self pity and guilt. “Guys Evan Hudson is safe because of what our dads thought us” Sam states firmly leaning forward in the back seat. “That’s their legacy” He added as the two kept their eyes on the road not daring to look at him.     “Now we’re still here. So we gotta keep going. For them.” Sam stated again. The two didn’t answer that was until a thought popped into Deans head remembering y/n’s hesitation at the crossroad. “Hey Princess?” Dean drew her attention to him blowing the smoke out from the corner of his lips. “Yeah?” She answered her eyes flickering over to him as he passed the almost finished bud back to her.     “When you were trapping that demon you weren’t-” He began taking a breath as she took the last drag. She knew what he wanted to ask though she was hoping he wouldn’t. “-…I mean it was all a trick right?” He asked his tone wary Sam’s eyes flickered between the two with concern. Y/N didn’t dare make eye contact with either of the Winchesters.     The palpable silence was deafening throughout the Impala. “Right?” Sam added in a shaky tone raising his eyebrows at her. She exhaled the last bit of her smoke before flicking the bud out the window. Before reaching over to Baby’s glove compartment she took out the mixtape Dean made for her before sliding it in.     The rock music drowned the silence out but not the tension as they drove down the dark road.        ________________________________        Authors Note: Hi beauties!

You watched him scoff leaving you at his silence. “Dean seriously?”   &lt;!-- more --&gt; The silence dragged on. Your mind raced a multitude of thoughts all fighting for the centre as you stared at him in complete disbelief.   Had any of it actually been true? Had he been lying to you the whole time just so you would stick around? You really wanted it to all be a horrible dream. The idea of him having the nerve sent white-hot rage through you.   “Say something.” You bit out. He flexed his hands as he finally raised his head. His eyes seemed to go everywhere but you as he looked around the room. “Nothing I say is going to fix this.”   He knew he’d fucked up. At the time he’d barely noticed it the lies seemed too small so inconsequential that he’d let them fall from his lips. He’d been so desperate to keep you around that he’d played into all your hopes and dreams in order to keep you.  It was bound to all come crashing down. He knew this yet the reality was worse than he’d imagined. The look in your eye left a pit in his stomach. Gone was any semblance of the warmth he’d grown used to replaced with a coldness which seemed so unnatural on you.  “You looked me in the eyes and told me you wanted to get married you wanted kids you wanted a white picket fence.” Your voice raised slightly as you spoke. “You told me you wanted out. That you would get out.” You trailed off.  Your anger seemed to disperse as he finally met your eyes. “You lied to me.”   “You lied to me and yet…” Your voice broke slightly as you sucked in a breath. “I still love you.”  A brief look of shock crossed his face as he leaned forward. His heart lurched at the words. You still loved him.  “We can figure this out” He reached over taking your hand in his. “We always do.”  For a moment you considered it. Forgiving him and going back to how things always were. Going back to a place where you were safe and comfortable both of you.  “No.” Your voice was quiet as you shook your head. You squeezed his hand. “We can’t.”  Tears pricked at your eyes as you watched him falter - that spark of hope in his eyes dying.  “Sweetheart…” He swallowed thickly feeling his words catch in his throat. “I want those things I want a family I just…I can’t leave this behind - at least not yet.”  Not yet. The words hung heavy.  You nodded. “Will you ever be ready?”  He paused. His eyes flashed with something unrecognisable as he averted his gaze. “I don’t know.” He whispered after a moment.  The breath seemed to leave your lungs. Every word seemed to break your heart over and over again. You loved him you really did. Dean Winchester truly was the love of your life.  “I can’t keep waiting. You’re pulling me along with promises we both know are only partly true.” Pulling yourself to your feet you walked around the table coming to stand in front of him. He looked up his eyes glassy with unleashed tears.  Placing a hand on his cheek you took a minute your eyes traced his face for a moment - taking note of every one of his features.  “It’s over Dean.”  Your words stabbed through his heart. He shook his head.   “Please.” You whispered. “Don’t make this harder.” Your thumb rubbed his cheek. “I love you I always will but we don’t work. We both want different things.”  “I want a life with you.” He placed a hand over yours. “I only want a life with you.”  “I want that too. I want that more than anything but I don’t want to do this forever.” You gestured around you. “I want a home Dean a proper one.”  His eyes searched yours for a moment looking for any sign that your words were a lie. “Okay.” He nodded after a moment. “I love you.” Dean leaned up his lips meeting yours for a moment before he pulled back.   “I love you too.” A weak smile crossed your face for a moment before you pulled back.   You stood in silence for a moment longer as you tried to work up the courage to leave. The knife in your heart only continued to twist as you watched him stand. He paused in front of you for a moment his eyes taking you in for one last time before he brushed past you one of his hands wiping at his eyes.  You watched him go your heart finally shattering as he disappeared around the corner taking your heart with him.,2024-07-08 21:04:49 GMT

You two won’t last.”  Every time someone doubted Jensen and I those thoughts echoed in my head. I hated feeling this anxious and overwhelmed. Normally I could handle my tough days but now everything felt fragile.  My anxiety only amplified when I had something real to lose. Jensen and I had something strong and deep. Just the idea of messing it all up made me nervous and scared.   I had mixed feelings about ow Jensen affected me. I hated how much I loved him and how I felt like I was never good enough. Instead of being happy he chose me over everyone else I kept feeling like I wasn’t worth it.   I don’t know how long I walked but it was late. The city was lit up but the sky was dark. I ended up at the park by the water where I used to go to find some peace and quiet surrounding myself with alone time. But now I didn’t want to be alone. I wanted Jensen with me. I really did but the words that tortured my mind were still there constantly. It wasn’t fair for him to do this to be with somebody like me.   My phone buzzed over and over. I pulled it out and sighed when I saw many missed messages-some from friends some from family and most from Jensen.   I knew I couldn’t ignore him. He was probably at my parents house worried sick just like when I cut my foot and he wouldn’t leave-he’s always dramatic but caring.  It didn’t take long before I heard him rushing toward me. He came running out of breath and hugged me tightly to his chest.  I tried to keep it together. It was hard enough to have his conversation with him and only became more difficult the more he comforted me. But I couldn’t hold back anymore. Jensen’s comforting smell and touch made me break down in tears. The sobs wracked through my body it was painful and earth shattering I felt like this feeling was going to kill me.  He held me close kissing my head over and over trying to pull me back to him. Eventually my tears slowed and he lifted my chin to look at him worried and loving.  “Jensen we can’t keep doing this.” I asked shaking my head.  He flinched hurt by my words. “What? Move to Texas? I told you we can take it slow.”  I pulled away and walked towards the river. “No this. Us.”  He looked heartbroken as he came closer touching my arm gently. “Please.. Don’t say that. I love you.”  I turned to face him feeling guilty and ashamed. “You think you love me but maybe I just took advantage when you were vulnerable I entered at a really tough time in your life.”  He reached out to hold me again. “Please honey That’s not true. You know how much I love you I wanted this I want you. Your mind is just beating you up please you have to trust me.”  I held back a sob and winced at the look on his face so hurt and vulnerable. I wanted to hold him to hug him tight but I knew it wasn’t right-I wasn’t right.  I put on a fake smile and gently pushed him back. “It’s okay Jensen we got caught up in the feeling of having somebody there but I’m not right for you. This isn’t right.”  He stood there quietly as I walked away my heart shattering as I felt like it might be really over. This was for the best… Right?  Wrong.  Jensen’s arm wrapped around mine as he spun me to face him his eyes filled with hurt and anger. “No. NO! You’re wrong. I love you so much but come on. You know us! Just for one moment forget everything that’s been said. Forget about my stupid titles or how our relationship started. When it’s just us you know how I feel about you. You know it’s real. Please…”  I listened carefully as his words swirled in my mind. Closing my eyes I visualized exactly what he meant. The moments in bed the kisses the tight embraces. The way he looked at me as if I were a priceless work of art. His deep care his unwavering fight for us. He was right. This was real. My doubts were tearing us apart and I couldn’t let that happen anymore.  Taking a step closer I noticed him swallow hard struggling to contain his emotions. Tears filled my eyes as I smiled reaching for his hand. “Jensen when I met you I expected the stars and maybe some planets. I never imagined you’d give me the whole galaxy. You’ve given me everything. You are everything. I’m just scared you’ll regret this or realize i’m too much that I’m falling apart.”  He pulled me close his voice cracking body trembling. “You are everything and more. You’re too good for me but here you are-mine. I could never regret this or walk away from you. You saved me.”  I nodded resting my head against his chest finding comfort in his warmth. Wrapping my arms around him I sighed. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry Jensen.”  He kissed my head deeply. “Don’t apologize. I love you baby forever.”  “I love you too Jensen.”  He stood upright wiping his tears with a smile. “Should we go back? You’re family’s probably worried.”  I sighed and nodded. “Yeah we should. I’m not ready but we should.”  “I’ve got your back honey. You’re not alone.”  Not alone. Never again.  Returning to the house filled me with dread. After talking with Jensen and calming down I realized how wrong they really were. They didn’t know me anymore know us. I had changed Jensen had changed me and this family had changed me. If they couldn’t support that I was ready to say goodbye right then and there.  I held Jensen’s hand tightly as we entered the home instantly my family rushed towards me one by one. Christina was first tears streaking her cheeks. She had always been a sweetheart craving love and acceptance. So when Stephanie and our parents yelled at one of us she sided with them out of fear of rejection or being different. I could tell she was genuinely sorry as she hugged me tightly.   “I’m so so sorry.”  Returning her hug I sighed. “I know. But what you all said was harsh and untrue. Do you understand that?”  She nodded firmly tears still flowing. “I do. We were out of line completely.”  My mom and dad approached Jensen and I “We support whatever you two decide. We’ll be there for you okay?”  I nodded wiping away a tear from my face. I glanced at Stephanie scoffing internally. The thing I learned about Stephanie was that sometimes she could be a very bitter opinionated and stubborn person. She always believed she was right needing to be taught why her words or actions hurt others.  Turning away I began to climb the stairs. “I forgive you guys of course. You’re my family. But Jensen is my family too. His kids are my family. I won’t choose which family to be with.”  Stephanie finally spoke up anger in her voice. “Because you’ll chose them?”  Glaring at her I smirked. “Yes I’ll chose them. And unlike you Stephanie choosing them doesn’t mean excluding those who want to be included. But those who don’t support us or aren’t a good influence on MY family? I won’t hesitate to cut them out. Don’t test me.”  With that I walked upstairs heading to the children’s room upstairs. Leaning against the doorway I watched them play engaged in their silly games and conversations and I couldn’t help but smile.  They might not be mine but I was going to treat them like they were. I’d do anything for them that’s what family did.  And they were mine.  Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it! Chapter 18 coming soon stay tuned!

He might’ve been pissed if the secret about Adam was revealed while John was alive but now that Adam’s alone and wanting revenge Sam decides to give him some pointers and is kind to him. He hates Lucifer and by all rights should be put off by Jack but he handles that too and there are many such incidents where he does something because someone has to or there’s a more principle-based than emotional reason to.,2024-07-08 21:40:56 GMT

38,Supernatural,['spn'  'dean winchester'  'castiel'  'destiel'  'my thoughts'],cas-poisoning,What’s the general consensus on when Dean and Cas fell in love and when they realized it? I’m curious what other people thought while watching the show.  To me it’s always been fairly obvious that Cas has loved Dean from the beginning. This is really important to his character arc as his love for Dean is what allowed him to understand free will desire and emotions beyond following the rule of heaven. Rebelling against heaven in season 4 is an important moment for Cas and I do think it only happened because he was in love with Dean.  Now controversially I don’t think Dean was in love with Cas at that point. They definitely had chemistry and I think there could have been some tension but I never really interpreted as love. I think Dean has a much more complex history of interpersonal relationships and emotions so it’s more realistic to me that it wasn’t really love at first sight especially because Dean had a lot of other big things going on. I think Cas started off as someone very important to Dean who didn’t have many friends and there was possibly attraction but I don’t think it was love until season 6 at the earliest.   Dean’s strange behavior wrt Cas and reacting so negatively to his plan with Crowley has always come off as Dean dealing with these new feelings for Cas especially against the context of him leaving Lisa and Ben and realizing that life is not for him. So I think season 6 is really when he fell in love with Cas thought I don’t know if he necessarily realized it at that point since so much was going on.  I’m less certain on when Dean and Cas actually realized their feelings. I’m going to pay attention to that on my rewatch because I haven’t actually watched supernatural in awhile. I think for Dean there are several points he could have realized but season 7 feels very likely. I forget the episode but at some point this is when he says something about angels not being able to handle this stuff or it breaks them. So I think this is when Dean resigned himself to never being loved back by Cas because he just always assumed Cas couldn’t feel that way as an angel.  I’m not quite sure when Cas realizes. I need to think about it more. My current guess would be season 9 when he becomes human because that’s when he truly intellectualizes everything he’s been feeling for the past few years.,2024-07-09 01:41:52 GMT

The respect that Garth holds for Dean and that Dean comes to hold for Garth is something that I think is rare and valuable for both of them.   I know Garth gets away with a lot because he’s just a Silly Little Guy and people don’t always take him seriously but the way that he and Dean interact is actually such a good example of a healthy platonic relationship between two men. I think Dean could have seriously benefitted by spending more time with Garth.   Their relationship is also such a good control to which we can juxtapose Dean’s obviously-more-than-just-friends relationships with men on the show.   For an example Dean and Garth hug in literally every episode they have together. Twice in 8.06 Southern Comfort and 15.10 The Heroes’ Journey. And they’re not all just casual greetings or farewells. Garth hugs Dean because he’s a hugger but also because he knows Dean needs physical comfort and isn’t getting it elsewhere (the hug at the end of Southern Comfort being a good example of this). Their hugging also demonstrates a level of increased comfort with each other (mostly on Dean’s end) as their relationship develops with the first one in 7.08 being awkward and not especially well received by Dean and Dean eventually being the one to initiate in 9.12. But it’s not romanticised or sexualised because they’re so clearly not romantic or sexual.   Cas despite being in almost 150 episodes and being around for three more seasons than Garth and being Dean’s “best friend” hugs Dean seven times throughout the whole show which is literally THE SAME NUMBER OF HUGS. We see the same number of Dean and Garth hugs as we see Dean and Cas hugs. The difference is that when the two of them (Dean and Cas) hug they tend to cling. They hold each other. They are physical with each other constantly in other ways but don’t bring each other to touch so fully except when they can excuse it with grief over one of them imminently dying the relief of one of them narrowly escaping death or some similar stakes. It means something more when they hug.   Even looking at Dean and Benny we can see that their hugs follow a pattern more similar to Dean and Cas than Dean and Garth. They hug twice in Benny’s seven episodes: once when they make it out of Purgatory and once before Dean kills Benny sending him back to Purgatory. Both of these instances fall under near-death/escaping death scenarios. And Dean spends a lot of time intentionally distancing himself from Benny (largely because of Sam) but when they are together they display a certain degree of physical closeness (not to the degree of Dean and Cas but really who does) that Dean and Garth don’t have.   There’s more to be said about how the absence of this intimacy in Dean’s homoerotic relationships is a tool of his denial and obviously hugging is only one metric by which we can compare these relationships but that’s all for now I guess.,2024-07-09 01:22:17 GMT

mob spends so much of his life trying to be cautious about the people around him and the consequences his emotions would bring to them that he can barely smile let alone even laugh in season 1. he refuses any easy pass dimple offers to get the things he wants and while it is noble in a way to strive to earn the things you want mob still just shuts off the part of himself that can want anything at all because he adheres so strictly to Reigen’s advice of how to get it.   jack is canonically characterized to always be thinking of other people and never himself (another script mention) and in 14x15 he blatantly tells Cas that it’s selfish of him to choose not to use his powers to help the people he loves even if that choice is for a good reason ie self-preservation. despite how adamant jack is for his own autonomy and responsibility he rarely advocates it for his own sake more so than he does the sake of others. he doesn’t like having to see his family worry about him he doesn’t like being considered a weak burden on their shoulders so he just represses himself and shoulders his own burdens and tries not to be too needy with it despite loving the feeling of being needed. but then this guy who blatantly feels like putting himself first is selfish and wrong is revealed to harbor a subconscious that tells him the exact opposite; he can’t worry about anyone else now he shouldn’t bother trying to make amends or to earn back their love because he’s just trying to “shed his own skin” and be something he knows he isn’t a self-made pet monster who was never really loved for anything more than what he could do for them so nothing matters more than staying alive and solely trusting himself.  i’ve talked about Jack’s rejection sensitivity before (and i will talk about it forever believe me) but I think that can also be applied to Mob too—or at least it can be applied to SHIGEO (also on another note i absolutely love how the hidden part of him is referred to with his real name it’s such a good detail that adds so much to him considering himself the Real One). going back to what I said at the top SHIGEO spends the second half of the Bouquet Arc trying to convince Mob that nobody else really wants him—everyone was either just using him or saw him as a freak because of his psychic powers and the only person who truly accepted him was Tsubomi. furthermore SHIGEO presses on that he’s the Real One—similar to how the Mauler Twins from Invincible are constantly arguing over who’s the original and who’s the clone (insane stretch but hear me out)—and since he’s the Real One he’s the one that nobody will accept. ‘Mob’ is just a mask; ‘Mob’ is just the persona that everyone else wants SHIGEO to be; Mob is what forced SHIGEO to hold back from doing literally everything he wants from being who he wants and getting what he wants completely inconsequentially to the effects it would have on others.   both jack and mob are completely horrified by these two sides of themselves; they are literally horrified by their own wants and internal desires and thoughts. mob is even so horrified that he internally tries to tell ritsu and teru that this side of himself isn’t him and not to accept it—to fight with all they have against it even—because they’ll just get hurt otherwise. and jack isn’t even just horrified he’s so angry at himself for even being this way to begin with that he tries to punch his own hallucination because he just can’t accept his own subconscious thoughts. he can’t accept the notion that this is his true nature or that he’s going to lose everything he’s ever had or loved because of it. to pull from my other RSD post both jack and mob (or these specific parts of themselves) are reacting to the idea of being rejected rather than the actual action and projecting their internal self-rejection onto everyone else around them   TLDR autism blast they’re best friends,2024-07-09 03:59:42 GMT

he can’t worry about anyone else now he shouldn’t bother trying to make amends or to earn back their love because he’s just trying to “shed his own skin” and be something he knows he isn’t a self-made pet monster who was never really loved for anything more than what he could do for them so nothing matters more than staying alive and solely trusting himself.  i’ve talked about Jack’s rejection sensitivity before (and i will talk about it forever believe me) but I think that can also be applied to Mob too—or at least it can be applied to SHIGEO (also on another note i absolutely love how the hidden part of him is referred to with his real name it’s such a good detail that adds so much to him considering himself the Real One). going back to what I said at the top SHIGEO spends the second half of the Bouquet Arc trying to convince Mob that nobody else really wants him—everyone was either just using him or saw him as a freak because of his psychic powers and the only person who truly accepted him was Tsubomi. furthermore SHIGEO presses on that he’s the Real One—similar to how the Mauler Twins from Invincible are constantly arguing over who’s the original and who’s the clone (insane stretch but hear me out)—and since he’s the Real One he’s the one that nobody will accept. ‘Mob’ is just a mask; ‘Mob’ is just the persona that everyone else wants SHIGEO to be; Mob is what forced SHIGEO to hold back from doing literally everything he wants from being who he wants and getting what he wants completely inconsequentially to the effects it would have on others.   both jack and mob are completely horrified by these two sides of themselves; they are literally horrified by their own wants and internal desires and thoughts. mob is even so horrified that he internally tries to tell ritsu and teru that this side of himself isn’t him and not to accept it—to fight with all they have against it even—because they’ll just get hurt otherwise. and jack isn’t even just horrified he’s so angry at himself for even being this way to begin with that he tries to punch his own hallucination because he just can’t accept his own subconscious thoughts. he can’t accept the notion that this is his true nature or that he’s going to lose everything he’s ever had or loved because of it. to pull from my other RSD post both jack and mob (or these specific parts of themselves) are reacting to the idea of being rejected rather than the actual action and projecting their internal self-rejection onto everyone else around them   TLDR autism blast they’re best friends,2024-07-09 03:59:42 GMT

(I am not mentally ok without bobby)   Dean being upset about Sam killing Emma who was actively trying to kill him yet thinking it was totally justified to kill Amy who had no intention of ever killing again major dick move.   I’ve been diagnosed by my gf as a “Dean-coded Sam girl” for whatever that’s worth.   Frank is a fucking icon and I love him 💕   Dean getting his movie dreams crushed with every time travel episode will never not be funny.

Feathered wings around their eyes purposely hiding their true nature (aka their eyes which are pure white instead of black) white is the bad color while black is the good one. “Demons” have black eyes like before expect if you’re lucky enough you can see a halo over evey demons head red as red can be. only a few lucky individuals have this power to see this. demons are seen as the good guys (which they are well some) and angels are seen a horrifying monsters you’d never want to bump into in an dark alley. the Winchesters hunt angels.

Not until castiel uttered the words “I love you” dean knew all those years. the real reason why castiel did everything and went against his own kind because of the Sher amount of love he felt for one pathetic little man named dean Winchester. he didn’t feel like he was good enough to deserve this type of love. not that he was complaining but everything coming together in his mind he couldn’t do much but beg castiel not to do this. and then it was to late left alone with sheer regret of not using the words “I love you to” he’d never been the type of guy to be up right with his words. even Sammy knew this hell Sam didn’t remember the last time dean told him he loved him fully Or just straight up said “I love you” he had his ways of using other words to avoid saying that one. Small sentence he feared so much. and now his one chance at any true love was gone like a blink of an eye how stupid could one man be? he’s done stupid things but this had to have been worst then that (I am half awake HELP). why? Why couldn’t he say one sentence not even a full one at that nothing more then three words and seven letters. Everytime he’d ever tried to it felt like his jaw would lock up as if it tried to keep from saying something he either didn’t really mean or something he couldn’t promise. couldn’t even tell the people he cared so dearly about he loved them. Maybe it was the shame he felt when he let out his side that was weaker then what he wore. The side that would shatter upon any small impact. he was like a ticking time bomb. he missed castiel. he was stunned and couldn’t do anything but let his outer shell shatter as the tears came running down like a waterfall. he couldn’t make them stop and his eyes started to burn with all the rubbing he was doing his lungs got tighter along with his wind pipes. Taking small gasps for air with every horrible sob. those words ruinned his life “I love you” wasn’t enough for him. why was he so selfish?,2024-07-09 06:43:06 GMT

Pretty basic but it’s not like angels r in hell or demons are in heaven it’s plain and simple; angels take the role of demons as the bad guys / evil ones. Their wings white instead of black like most angels have shadowy wings in supernatural. Feathered wings around their eyes purposely hiding their true nature (aka their eyes which are pure white instead of black) white is the bad color while black is the good one. “Demons” have black eyes like before expect if you’re lucky enough you can see a halo over evey demons head red as red can be. only a few lucky individuals have this power to see this. demons are seen as the good guys (which they are well some) and angels are seen a horrifying monsters you’d never want to bump into in an dark alley. the Winchesters hunt angels. Black pepper is used against angels like salt is for demons in the original show. Satanist are seen as the preachers while preachers are seen as the hell or well heaven shakening (?) Guys. castiel their feathered friend is now a scaley like a snake. Uhhh that’s about it,2024-07-09 06:14:29 GMT

I found a passion for writing and just recently began writing my own fanfiction.

It’s the reason Im finally getting my first tattoo (this August eeeeee) and going to my first convention is October and I’ll have the pleasure of meeting the actors who play my two very favourite idiots in love.

Those who were there or have contributed to the discussion after the fact are: @notsofly @spn-fanfic-reblog-writes @kazsrm67 @thoughtslikeaminefield @zepskies @talltalesandbedtimestories and @stunudo. Below the cut is a rundown of the points that we discussed!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; How do you reduce the use of Y/N and similar placeholders?   Nicknames - This is especially easy when writing SPN because Dean loves giving nicknames to everyone. For placeholders like Y/H/C and Y/E/C - When writing from the RIC’s (Reader Insert Character) POV (Point Of View) this is easy because most people don’t consider their own hair or eye color. When writing from another character’s POV like an SPN Character (SPNC) focus on attributes like how eyes can shine or narrow. Hair can be soft or shiny. Decide if the detail you’re referring to is necessary to the story. If the plot doesn’t change without it do you really need to include it? How much detail does an RIC need?  Only those details that would change the story if they were different or missing. For example if a story is about aging/maturity or how a RIC reacts to new tech then age is necessary.  What specific details should you leave out when possible?  Hair length/style - Some women have very short hair that can’t be put into a ponytail or braided. Focus on feel of the hair not tangling it into someone’s fingers. Weight - You can mention curves and leave the rest to the imagination. Blushing - You can feel your face get hot but you can’t really see yourself blushing. Describe the feeling over the appearance. Darker skin tones don’t turn noticeably red when blushing. Race/ethnicity - Unless your story involves ethnic customs or dealing with something specifically racial this is not a necessary detail. Clothing - Unless a hunter is dressing up clothing does not need to be specifically described. Even when dressing up clothing can be described generically. “A dress in her favorite color that showed off her assets and minimized those little parts of herself she wanted hidden.” A job can affect clothing but just going to the mall or on a date does not. Describe comfort over style. What is the difference between an OC (Original Character) and a RIC?  Backstory - OC’s will usually have a backstory to help define their character. RIC’s only need backstory as it pertains to the current story. They can have one but only what’s needed for the story. Name  Physical description - OC’s need to be described but RIC’s need to not be described as much as possible.  Does an RI fic need to be in 2nd Person POV?  No. They can also be written in 3rd person omniscient (the audience knows what everyone is thinking) or 3rd person limited POV (the audience only knows what one person is thinking as if they were in that character’s head). Are RI fics more popular on one platform vs. another?  Yes. RI fics seem to be a lot more popular on Tumblr than on AO3. Tumblr also seems to prefer RIC’s over OC’s. We don’t know why. Ways to describe eyes that don’t involve color?  Focus on the emotions - see emotions in their eyes instead of color Focus on actions - eyes crinkling slitting narrowing widening. She batted her eyes or looked up at him through her lashes. Other adjectives besides color - Bright eyes shining eyes etc NO ORBS.  How do you write a Gender Neutral RIC (GNRIC)?  You have to avoid gender stereotypes like women being more emotional and emotionally available while men are more stoic and stubborn. Women and men stereotypically flirt differently. You need to identify those traits in your story and balance them out to neutralize them. Get down to your basic “people” traits for the character. Who cuddles who? Maybe the SPNC comes to the GNRIC and asks for cuddles? Decide if that kind of thing matters and why. The GNRIC discussion at the end of our time led to the creation of a writing challenge to explore gender. How would we write a female RIC differently from a male RIC if they were put into the same story? How does knowing this help us to strip gender stereotypes from our story to make a truly gender-neutral RIC?

Not until castiel uttered the words “I love you” dean knew all those years. the real reason why castiel did everything and went against his own kind because of the Sher amount of love he felt for one pathetic little man named dean Winchester. he didn’t feel like he was good enough to deserve this type of love. not that he was complaining but everything coming together in his mind he couldn’t do much but beg castiel not to do this. and then it was to late left alone with sheer regret of not using the words “I love you to” he’d never been the type of guy to be up right with his words. even Sammy knew this hell Sam didn’t remember the last time dean told him he loved him fully Or just straight up said “I love you” he had his ways of using other words to avoid saying that one. Small sentence he feared so much. and now his one chance at any true love was gone like a blink of an eye how stupid could one man be? he’s done stupid things but this had to have been worst then that (I am half awake HELP). why? Why couldn’t he say one sentence not even a full one at that nothing more then three words and seven letters. Everytime he’d ever tried to it felt like his jaw would lock up as if it tried to keep from saying something he either didn’t really mean or something he couldn’t promise. couldn’t even tell the people he cared so dearly about he loved them. Maybe it was the shame he felt when he let out his side that was weaker then what he wore. The side that would shatter upon any small impact. he was like a ticking time bomb. he missed castiel. he was stunned and couldn’t do anything but let his outer shell shatter as the tears came running down like a waterfall. he couldn’t make them stop and his eyes started to burn with all the rubbing he was doing his lungs got tighter along with his wind pipes. Taking small gasps for air with every horrible sob. those words ruinned his life “I love you” wasn’t enough for him. why was he so selfish?,2024-07-09 06:43:06 GMT

0,Supernatural,['nym finally watched supernatural'  'doctor who'  'spn'  'good omens'  'eternal law'  'angels'],nym-wibbly,nym_wibbly | Fan me (with your broken wings) baby  The new-new-new-Doctor is amazing no surprise there and his companion Ruby is super good fun but thus far RTD is failing to grab me by the Whovian feels this time around. I’ll be the first to admit that I’m over-invested in the heavy minor key antihero angst of the Dark Doctor and New Who eras of Doctor Who - in the Doctor having the weight of the universe on their shoulders having hubris and gradually staggering under the burden kept afloat only by the occasional regeneration and new pal. I think it’s genius to hit reset by having Tennant cart the character’s baggage off down a handy little time loop-the-loop with Donna and fam leaving it there so Gatwa can fly free but I’m headscratching about what kind of Doctor we’re left with in Gatwa once they’ve hugged it out. He’s mercurial compassionate open queer sassy… and what else? Hmm as they say. As ever I’ll wait and see.  I’ve had a year weirdly full of angels between Good Omens 2 finally digging up a streaming copy of Eternal Law because Hattie Morahan and a trawl through the TV career of the late and amazing Tom Bell that included the rejected Angels pilot. IMDB lists it as a TV movie but it was a pilot part of a short season of pilots that duked it out for the magic pickup. It lost and was never seen again so I have no qualms about linking to it on YouTube.  ALT It had a formative effect on me in all sorts of surprising ways for a shaky little 1990’s dud (though the casting was to die for which helps). I can still see its influence in what fanfic I’ve managed to write about the angels of Good Omens. Pretty impressive given that I only saw it once when it aired in… oh look. 1992. I was 18.  The past couple of months I finally - FINALLY - got around to trying Supernatural (because Mark Sheppard) after all these years decades of ducking every press release every fanfic every spoiler except that last ‘shippy one cuz Tumblr went mental that night the fandom’s angst filling the entire world. So I know how it almost ends for one character (sounds awesome to me based on what I’ve seen thus far) and that COVID ate their finale but the rest is all new to me. I just started S10 and after “Meta Fiction” I’m more sure than ever that Chuck will turn out to be God. Is that nuts? The show is nuts.  Fucked-up angels FTW then. (I used to be able to chuck the Doctor into that broad category &#x27;my lonely angel’ but he got better).,2024-05-25 08:26:00 GMT

Those who were there or have contributed to the discussion after the fact are: @notsofly @spn-fanfic-reblog-writes @kazsrm67 @thoughtslikeaminefield @zepskies @talltalesandbedtimestories and @stunudo. Below the cut is a rundown of the points that we discussed!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; How do you reduce the use of Y/N and similar placeholders?   Nicknames - This is especially easy when writing SPN because Dean loves giving nicknames to everyone. For placeholders like Y/H/C and Y/E/C - When writing from the RIC’s (Reader Insert Character) POV (Point Of View) this is easy because most people don’t consider their own hair or eye color. When writing from another character’s POV like an SPN Character (SPNC) focus on attributes like how eyes can shine or narrow. Hair can be soft or shiny. Decide if the detail you’re referring to is necessary to the story. If the plot doesn’t change without it do you really need to include it? How much detail does an RIC need?  Only those details that would change the story if they were different or missing. For example if a story is about aging/maturity or how a RIC reacts to new tech then age is necessary.  What specific details should you leave out when possible?  Hair length/style - Some women have very short hair that can’t be put into a ponytail or braided. Focus on feel of the hair not tangling it into someone’s fingers. Weight - You can mention curves and leave the rest to the imagination. Blushing - You can feel your face get hot but you can’t really see yourself blushing. Describe the feeling over the appearance. Darker skin tones don’t turn noticeably red when blushing. Race/ethnicity - Unless your story involves ethnic customs or dealing with something specifically racial this is not a necessary detail. Clothing - Unless a hunter is dressing up clothing does not need to be specifically described. Even when dressing up clothing can be described generically. “A dress in her favorite color that showed off her assets and minimized those little parts of herself she wanted hidden.” A job can affect clothing but just going to the mall or on a date does not. Describe comfort over style. What is the difference between an OC (Original Character) and a RIC?  Backstory - OC’s will usually have a backstory to help define their character. RIC’s only need backstory as it pertains to the current story. They can have one but only what’s needed for the story. Name  Physical description - OC’s need to be described but RIC’s need to not be described as much as possible.  Does an RI fic need to be in 2nd Person POV?  No. They can also be written in 3rd person omniscient (the audience knows what everyone is thinking) or 3rd person limited POV (the audience only knows what one person is thinking as if they were in that character’s head). Are RI fics more popular on one platform vs. another?  Yes. RI fics seem to be a lot more popular on Tumblr than on AO3. Tumblr also seems to prefer RIC’s over OC’s. We don’t know why. Ways to describe eyes that don’t involve color?  Focus on the emotions - see emotions in their eyes instead of color Focus on actions - eyes crinkling slitting narrowing widening. She batted her eyes or looked up at him through her lashes. Other adjectives besides color - Bright eyes shining eyes etc NO ORBS.  How do you write a Gender Neutral RIC (GNRIC)?  You have to avoid gender stereotypes like women being more emotional and emotionally available while men are more stoic and stubborn. Women and men stereotypically flirt differently. You need to identify those traits in your story and balance them out to neutralize them. Get down to your basic “people” traits for the character. Who cuddles who? Maybe the SPNC comes to the GNRIC and asks for cuddles? Decide if that kind of thing matters and why. The GNRIC discussion at the end of our time led to the creation of a writing challenge to explore gender. How would we write a female RIC differently from a male RIC if they were put into the same story? How does knowing this help us to strip gender stereotypes from our story to make a truly gender-neutral RIC?

Dean’s ready even eager to sacrifice himself to a fate worse than death; Sam can’t take it and breaks down after sticking out the quiet stoicism thing for most of the season; Castiel’s not taking it and angrily calls Dean out (without beating the shit out of him this time). And for once it’s Dean who backs down letting his little brother need him.  Personal growth all around everyone using their words only for Jack to quietly go and lose his way the moment he gets his superpowers back. Donatello gave him good advice on making moral calls while soulless - what would the Winchesters (or Mr Rogers) do? - but forgot he was talking to a two-year-old incapable of applying it with any great insight. And Cas witnessed Jack’s first chilly-logic slip into murderous mercy without confronting him? After Cas put all his faith in what Jack’s meant to become?

It and the end of 12x09 went some way to answering the question I was getting nowhere with yesterday - ‘where’s my in for fanficcing Castiel?’. That angel finally reached max gross load there and got angry with his situation to the extent of taking it out on his friends. He’s acting put-upon and under-appreciated exasperated to tears with the Winchesters’ latest attempt to sacrifice themselves to save each other. That sarcastic bitter &#x27;You’re welcome’ at the end of 12x09 was a huge moment for the character.  Since beating Dean senseless back in S5 he’s sat on his frustrations fears disappointments and failures like a champ and put up with those of others with tired stoicism and humility. When he’s screwed up he’s done so from honest motives - protect Winchesters; fix what’s broke; be of service. He’s been learning and growing in every way he possibly can - from practical and emotional experience from suffering and loss from personal failure from self-reflection from the Novak family he nuked just by showing up and from his friends.  The early evolution of the season 4/5 angels storyline showed Heaven flailing because God had left the building without leaving a plan the remaining archangels holding it all together with the Apocalypse as the be-all-and-end-all of existence. By season 6 they’re fighting a multi-front civil war. By season 8 they’re all but destroyed their numbers dangerously low and we learn that it’s taken brutal brainwashing - repeated full factory resets in Castiel’s case - to keep the rank and file angels in line since at least Biblical times. Even the higher ranking angels are lost sheep guessing at what God wants of them and - whether explicitly or not - asking &#x27;Father why?’  By the time God dropped in at the end of season 11 when it looked like his last and only chance Castiel had nothing left to say to him and no questions he felt were worth asking. On the one hand maybe a missed opportunity for the characters but on the other… maybe that lack of a conversation with Cas said it all? Chuck had The Conversation with Dean and with Lucifer but he has no connection with the lower-ranking angels. None. God is over Castiel who keeps not quite playing out his role in the story; and Cas has been pretty well cured of his zealous &#x27;because God’ angel programming along with any illusion of a benign or worthy father figure in Chuck.  He’s left with this quietly resentful disappointment that turns easily to self-loathing and self-doubt when he encounters failure. He doesn’t take the opportunity to share that with Chuck a detail hammered home by also having Misha Collins play Lucifer in that setup - a no-holds-barred personal messy-emotional father-son relationship with God that Castiel never had.  He’s gone from resentment towards Dean for distracting him from his obligation to Heaven with its security blanket of narrow emotionless certainty to the complete reverse focusing everything he has on the Winchesters - Mary included - because Cas still needs something to believe in and something to serve. He equates that now with his protective love for this human found-family who taught him how to feel love and live. With Dean especially who doesn’t see his own value and keeps endangering his life and soul.  Cas doesn’t believe in himself though not even slightly. He still only defines himself knows himself relative to something he views as greater and more important than himself and as a cause worth killing or dying for. He’s trying to do his duty as he sees it - his duty to the thing he has faith in. It still hurts him when that faith lets him down and that’s the &#x27;in’ I was looking for.,2024-06-08 02:55:00 GMT

It’s the reason Im finally getting my first tattoo (this August eeeeee) and going to my first convention is October and I’ll have the pleasure of meeting the actors who play my two very favourite idiots in love.

Those who were there or have contributed to the discussion after the fact are: @notsofly @spn-fanfic-reblog-writes @kazsrm67 @thoughtslikeaminefield @zepskies @talltalesandbedtimestories and @stunudo. Below the cut is a rundown of the points that we discussed!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; How do you reduce the use of Y/N and similar placeholders?   Nicknames - This is especially easy when writing SPN because Dean loves giving nicknames to everyone. For placeholders like Y/H/C and Y/E/C - When writing from the RIC’s (Reader Insert Character) POV (Point Of View) this is easy because most people don’t consider their own hair or eye color. When writing from another character’s POV like an SPN Character (SPNC) focus on attributes like how eyes can shine or narrow. Hair can be soft or shiny. Decide if the detail you’re referring to is necessary to the story. If the plot doesn’t change without it do you really need to include it? How much detail does an RIC need?  Only those details that would change the story if they were different or missing. For example if a story is about aging/maturity or how a RIC reacts to new tech then age is necessary.  What specific details should you leave out when possible?  Hair length/style - Some women have very short hair that can’t be put into a ponytail or braided. Focus on feel of the hair not tangling it into someone’s fingers. Weight - You can mention curves and leave the rest to the imagination. Blushing - You can feel your face get hot but you can’t really see yourself blushing. Describe the feeling over the appearance. Darker skin tones don’t turn noticeably red when blushing. Race/ethnicity - Unless your story involves ethnic customs or dealing with something specifically racial this is not a necessary detail. Clothing - Unless a hunter is dressing up clothing does not need to be specifically described. Even when dressing up clothing can be described generically. “A dress in her favorite color that showed off her assets and minimized those little parts of herself she wanted hidden.” A job can affect clothing but just going to the mall or on a date does not. Describe comfort over style. What is the difference between an OC (Original Character) and a RIC?  Backstory - OC’s will usually have a backstory to help define their character. RIC’s only need backstory as it pertains to the current story. They can have one but only what’s needed for the story. Name  Physical description - OC’s need to be described but RIC’s need to not be described as much as possible.  Does an RI fic need to be in 2nd Person POV?  No. They can also be written in 3rd person omniscient (the audience knows what everyone is thinking) or 3rd person limited POV (the audience only knows what one person is thinking as if they were in that character’s head). Are RI fics more popular on one platform vs. another?  Yes. RI fics seem to be a lot more popular on Tumblr than on AO3. Tumblr also seems to prefer RIC’s over OC’s. We don’t know why. Ways to describe eyes that don’t involve color?  Focus on the emotions - see emotions in their eyes instead of color Focus on actions - eyes crinkling slitting narrowing widening. She batted her eyes or looked up at him through her lashes. Other adjectives besides color - Bright eyes shining eyes etc NO ORBS.  How do you write a Gender Neutral RIC (GNRIC)?  You have to avoid gender stereotypes like women being more emotional and emotionally available while men are more stoic and stubborn. Women and men stereotypically flirt differently. You need to identify those traits in your story and balance them out to neutralize them. Get down to your basic “people” traits for the character. Who cuddles who? Maybe the SPNC comes to the GNRIC and asks for cuddles? Decide if that kind of thing matters and why. The GNRIC discussion at the end of our time led to the creation of a writing challenge to explore gender. How would we write a female RIC differently from a male RIC if they were put into the same story? How does knowing this help us to strip gender stereotypes from our story to make a truly gender-neutral RIC?

It wasn’t the first time Cas was “gone” but this time was different. Dean could see Cas in his physical form as a vessel but that stung even more. It reminded him of all the little things that made Cas Cas. And he missed them now more than ever.  During their strategizing sessions Dean worried that the fact that his concern for saving Cas from Lucifer overshadowed saving the universe would become too evident.   He lost sleep over Cas. Dean had always been concerned about the angel but now his heart beat differently. He was feeling emotions he hadn’t felt in a long time. Sometimes he stayed awake imagining what it would be like to have Castiel around again to be healed by him just so he could feel his touch again.   Dean had pictured it a million times in his head even then he didn’t know how to act when Cas finally returned. He had so much to say yet no words could capture the depth of his emotions.  Back at the bunker Dean sat at the table drinking his beer when Cas approached him. Cas studied Dean’s bruised face with concern then gently rested his hand on Dean’s cheek. Dean instantly relaxed leaning into Cas’ touch as he felt himself healing and not just physically.   “Cas I-” Dean started to speak but Sam entered the room interrupting him. Cas withdrew his hand taking a step back.  “Great Cas healed you. Now it’s your turn to run an errand” Sam said to his brother.   Dean rolled his eyes standing up. “Wanna come with?” he asked Cas hoping for a moment alone with him. Cas nodded.  Dean kept glancing at Cas while driving it was always funny to him how laser focused Cas looked even when nothing alarming was happening. Dean took Cas’ hand in his and said “You need to relax a little”.   Cas tilted his head in confusion “What do you mean?”.   Dean chucked and replied “You know loosen up a little you survived freaking LUCIFER man.”  “Then what do you suggest I should do?”  There were a lot of suggestions in Dean’s mind but he let those slide for now.  When they reached the store Dean realised he had been holding Cas’ hand the entire ride. And the best part was that Cas let him. It wasn’t awkward it simply felt natural. Cas gave him his half-smile then looked at their hands held together and delicately traced his thumb over Dean’s hand. Everything around seemed to fade away and Dean just wanted to stay in this moment forever.,2024-07-09 11:31:00 GMT

Elvira and Abel grew up together in Wyoming through the 1840s. Abel was always known for taking life at his own pace and being a dreamy sort of boy and Elvira loved him for the way he could get her to slow down for a time. After proposing to him herself they were married when she was 18. They lived happily for a short two years before Abel disappeared without a trace. Elvira looked for him for a number of months but in the end had no choice but to move on but she carried him with her forever keeping his name and even passing it on to her wife when she remarried.   Ultimately I want to leave it up to you what drove Abel to leave his wife behind but I’m thinking something changed him. Be it a vampire or some variety of lycanthrope or something else entirely it would only need to be something that would make him long lived. I’m wildly open to all sorts of ideas. His entire history beyond his marriage to Elvira is open as is his face. I’m also open to his first name being changed but his surname must be Willows since he’s how Elvira got the name herself. This is not a romance plot between them they have both since moved on assuming the other was long gone but they loved each other deeply when they were young in a way that never would have faded. If they were to find one another again it would most likely feel like an unexpected and welcome reunion between the oldest of friends.  IAN PORTER | THE KID BROTHER SHE RAISED  AGE: 182 • WERE-CREATURE  Sandwiched between an accomplished witch for an older sister and twin younger brothers Ian was the oft ignored middle child in the Porter household. Elvira did the brunt of the work in raising Ian and they became incredibly close as he grew up. Elvira was a constant presence in his life until she left their family’s homestead behind for good when she was 23 and he was barely 15. They wrote each other frequently in the years after but Elvira became wrapped up in a life that demanded much of her and rarely left Penance where she settled.   Ian’s life beyond childhood is entirely open aside from the fact that at some point through his life he became infected by the bite of a were-creature that slowed his aging tremendously. Face claim is totally open though it’d be cool if we could find someone that makes them believable siblings (just because he’s technically younger doesn’t mean he has to look it anymore). I’m not overly attached to Elvira’s maiden name of Porter or the name Ian so we can definitely come up with something you may like better if the ad interests you otherwise. That said I’m liable to be a little picky about it so forgive me. Besides that the world is your oyster.,2024-07-09 11:01:19 GMT

Dean’s ready even eager to sacrifice himself to a fate worse than death; Sam can’t take it and breaks down after sticking out the quiet stoicism thing for most of the season; Castiel’s not taking it and angrily calls Dean out (without beating the shit out of him this time). And for once it’s Dean who backs down letting his little brother need him.  Personal growth all around everyone using their words only for Jack to quietly go and lose his way the moment he gets his superpowers back. Donatello gave him good advice on making moral calls while soulless - what would the Winchesters (or Mr Rogers) do? - but forgot he was talking to a two-year-old incapable of applying it with any great insight. And Cas witnessed Jack’s first chilly-logic slip into murderous mercy without confronting him? After Cas put all his faith in what Jack’s meant to become?

I’ve moved on to Supernatural season 12 mildly impressed that the characters didn’t dig themselves into a still-deeper hole at the end of season 11 instead relying on a new outsider to do it for them.  I loved seeing the ensemble cast come together for those last couple of eps. It made me notice that Jensen Ackles is one of those (increasingly rare) lead TV performers who stays 100% in character when the camera’s on somebody else supporting their performance with his own even if he has no lines and nothing to do but be there in the background. Quality sir. Quality.  ETA: Castiel’s character arc is quite something. He’s gone from one of the most arresting and awe-inspiring character entrances I’ve ever seen at the start of S4 terrifying certainty to being completely lost without a compass at the start of S12. And I know where he eventually ends up even if I don’t know what comes between now and then. It’s refreshing that he just gets on with it with stoicism and minimal wallowing - all very show-not-tell. His friends seem to think he’s okay as long as he’s not actively going cuckoo (again) so from a fanfiction writer perspective I’m wondering how it’s possible to explore all that wonderful angst without diluting what makes the character so unique. Without making him more human to bring it to the surface. Where’s the ‘in’ with Castiel?,2024-06-06 07:42:00 GMT

3,Supernatural,['nym finally watched supernatural'  'spn'  'supernatural meta'  'castiel'  'misha collins'  'chuck shurley'  'fanfiction meta'],nym-wibbly,nym_wibbly | Castiel - half an answer in the eps I watched yesterday  The last Supernatural ep we watched last night was 12x10 Lily Sunder Has Some Regrets. It and the end of 12x09 went some way to answering the question I was getting nowhere with yesterday - ‘where’s my in for fanficcing Castiel?’. That angel finally reached max gross load there and got angry with his situation to the extent of taking it out on his friends. He’s acting put-upon and under-appreciated exasperated to tears with the Winchesters’ latest attempt to sacrifice themselves to save each other. That sarcastic bitter &#x27;You’re welcome’ at the end of 12x09 was a huge moment for the character.  Since beating Dean senseless back in S5 he’s sat on his frustrations fears disappointments and failures like a champ and put up with those of others with tired stoicism and humility. When he’s screwed up he’s done so from honest motives - protect Winchesters; fix what’s broke; be of service. He’s been learning and growing in every way he possibly can - from practical and emotional experience from suffering and loss from personal failure from self-reflection from the Novak family he nuked just by showing up and from his friends.  The early evolution of the season 4/5 angels storyline showed Heaven flailing because God had left the building without leaving a plan the remaining archangels holding it all together with the Apocalypse as the be-all-and-end-all of existence. By season 6 they’re fighting a multi-front civil war. By season 8 they’re all but destroyed their numbers dangerously low and we learn that it’s taken brutal brainwashing - repeated full factory resets in Castiel’s case - to keep the rank and file angels in line since at least Biblical times. Even the higher ranking angels are lost sheep guessing at what God wants of them and - whether explicitly or not - asking &#x27;Father why?’  By the time God dropped in at the end of season 11 when it looked like his last and only chance Castiel had nothing left to say to him and no questions he felt were worth asking. On the one hand maybe a missed opportunity for the characters but on the other… maybe that lack of a conversation with Cas said it all? Chuck had The Conversation with Dean and with Lucifer but he has no connection with the lower-ranking angels. None. God is over Castiel who keeps not quite playing out his role in the story; and Cas has been pretty well cured of his zealous &#x27;because God’ angel programming along with any illusion of a benign or worthy father figure in Chuck.  He’s left with this quietly resentful disappointment that turns easily to self-loathing and self-doubt when he encounters failure. He doesn’t take the opportunity to share that with Chuck a detail hammered home by also having Misha Collins play Lucifer in that setup - a no-holds-barred personal messy-emotional father-son relationship with God that Castiel never had.  He’s gone from resentment towards Dean for distracting him from his obligation to Heaven with its security blanket of narrow emotionless certainty to the complete reverse focusing everything he has on the Winchesters - Mary included - because Cas still needs something to believe in and something to serve. He equates that now with his protective love for this human found-family who taught him how to feel love and live. With Dean especially who doesn’t see his own value and keeps endangering his life and soul.  Cas doesn’t believe in himself though not even slightly. He still only defines himself knows himself relative to something he views as greater and more important than himself and as a cause worth killing or dying for. He’s trying to do his duty as he sees it - his duty to the thing he has faith in. It still hurts him when that faith lets him down and that’s the &#x27;in’ I was looking for.,2024-06-08 02:55:00 GMT

It wasn’t the first time Cas was “gone” but this time was different. Dean could see Cas in his physical form as a vessel but that stung even more. It reminded him of all the little things that made Cas Cas. And he missed them now more than ever.  During their strategizing sessions Dean worried that the fact that his concern for saving Cas from Lucifer overshadowed saving the universe would become too evident.   He lost sleep over Cas. Dean had always been concerned about the angel but now his heart beat differently. He was feeling emotions he hadn’t felt in a long time. Sometimes he stayed awake imagining what it would be like to have Castiel around again to be healed by him just so he could feel his touch again.   Dean had pictured it a million times in his head even then he didn’t know how to act when Cas finally returned. He had so much to say yet no words could capture the depth of his emotions.  Back at the bunker Dean sat at the table drinking his beer when Cas approached him. Cas studied Dean’s bruised face with concern then gently rested his hand on Dean’s cheek. Dean instantly relaxed leaning into Cas’ touch as he felt himself healing and not just physically.   “Cas I-” Dean started to speak but Sam entered the room interrupting him. Cas withdrew his hand taking a step back.  “Great Cas healed you. Now it’s your turn to run an errand” Sam said to his brother.   Dean rolled his eyes standing up. “Wanna come with?” he asked Cas hoping for a moment alone with him. Cas nodded.  Dean kept glancing at Cas while driving it was always funny to him how laser focused Cas looked even when nothing alarming was happening. Dean took Cas’ hand in his and said “You need to relax a little”.   Cas tilted his head in confusion “What do you mean?”.   Dean chucked and replied “You know loosen up a little you survived freaking LUCIFER man.”  “Then what do you suggest I should do?”  There were a lot of suggestions in Dean’s mind but he let those slide for now.  When they reached the store Dean realised he had been holding Cas’ hand the entire ride. And the best part was that Cas let him. It wasn’t awkward it simply felt natural. Cas gave him his half-smile then looked at their hands held together and delicately traced his thumb over Dean’s hand. Everything around seemed to fade away and Dean just wanted to stay in this moment forever.,2024-07-09 11:31:00 GMT

1,Supernatural,['nym finally watched supernatural'  'spn'  'supernatural meta'  'castiel'  'jimmy novak'],nym-wibbly,nym_wibbly | Sweet summer child (that mass murderer Castiel)  I just skipped back to the start of Supernatural season five (from fourteen) to refresh my memory about how Nick/Lucifer’s arc began. Accidentally landed on the scene in the hospital where Castiel having picked his side at the end of S4 complains that he “killed two angels this week”. Oh bby.  The show’s never delved deeply into that aspect of Castiel’s storyline. He’s feared and loathed by other angels but we’ve seen little of how he feels about that. Few characters can get a rise out of him under any provocation so we just get occasional glimpses of his fear and anger when one of the Winchesters goes recklessly suicidal and makes Cas afraid his sacrifices are in vain and his faith misplaced. He needs to feel that it’s been worth it and panics when that gets hard. He’s killed so many of his own kind both in combat and when he went nuclear at the start of S7. He’s been significantly responsible for the genocide and near extinction of the angels both through personal kills and through his epic hubris in seasons 6 7 and 9.  He feels the guilt and shame he undergoes atonement and he learns to do and be better - but he keeps on killing angels when he needs to. All that slaughter yet I truly believed him when he told Nick that it’s the personal human tragedy of Jimmy Novak and family - the unintended consequence of his ignorance and blind faith his angelic innocence - that metaphorically speaking keeps Cas awake at night. That was just raw for him and Nick touched a nerve while the fate of Heaven in which he’s taken a conscious part is a dull burden that Cas carries and owns without outward displays of overwhelming emotion.  It ought to come over as a terrible terrifying zealotry on Castiel’s part - the kind that tips the balance from hero to antihero/villain and the kind of cold absolutism he consciously walked away from at the end of S4 when Dean challenged him to choose between right and wrong instead of relying on blind faith but it doesn’t read that way. His self-doubt is infinitely more dangerous to bystanders - to his friends - than his righteous certainty.  When he succumbs to a dangerous anger in his private trauma he has the insight to isolate himself and when that fails he has the self-awareness to stop short of beating the helpless Metatron to death because he can still draw a clear distinction between an enemy and a threat. He knows how dangerous he is and warns people when it’s viable to do so. He does everything in his power to see that he’s safely restrained when Rowena’s slavering-killer spell overtakes him when he knows the choice is going to be taken out of his hands. The rest of the time his self-control is epic. Even the tired kind and caring dad!Cas of season 13/14 is first and foremost a soldier making a soldier’s choices with a soldier’s strategy a defender rather than an aggressor. Somehow even with the shocking death toll he’s racked up he’s a protector figure not something out of a nightmare. Just like the Winchesters.  It’s like he’s helpless to prevent his part in harming Heaven even as he’s the one stabbing and exploding his siblings all over the place. Mind you the other angels never learn. They keep coming at him with pointy things and/or threatening the Winchesters and when they do occasionally manage to take him off the board Chuck puts him right back. As of S14 even Naomi seems to have grasped that making Castiel choose between his own kind and his adopted family isn’t a survival strategy. I’m not optimistic that any of the angels (bar semi-angelic Jack I guess) will be left standing by the series finale. The shape of the story seems to demand that they move over to make way for a better tomorrow - along with God. But if God’s the one writing the story it’s unlikely to be that simple!

Elvira and Abel grew up together in Wyoming through the 1840s. Abel was always known for taking life at his own pace and being a dreamy sort of boy and Elvira loved him for the way he could get her to slow down for a time. After proposing to him herself they were married when she was 18. They lived happily for a short two years before Abel disappeared without a trace. Elvira looked for him for a number of months but in the end had no choice but to move on but she carried him with her forever keeping his name and even passing it on to her wife when she remarried.   Ultimately I want to leave it up to you what drove Abel to leave his wife behind but I’m thinking something changed him. Be it a vampire or some variety of lycanthrope or something else entirely it would only need to be something that would make him long lived. I’m wildly open to all sorts of ideas. His entire history beyond his marriage to Elvira is open as is his face. I’m also open to his first name being changed but his surname must be Willows since he’s how Elvira got the name herself. This is not a romance plot between them they have both since moved on assuming the other was long gone but they loved each other deeply when they were young in a way that never would have faded. If they were to find one another again it would most likely feel like an unexpected and welcome reunion between the oldest of friends.  IAN PORTER | THE KID BROTHER SHE RAISED  AGE: 182 • WERE-CREATURE  Sandwiched between an accomplished witch for an older sister and twin younger brothers Ian was the oft ignored middle child in the Porter household. Elvira did the brunt of the work in raising Ian and they became incredibly close as he grew up. Elvira was a constant presence in his life until she left their family’s homestead behind for good when she was 23 and he was barely 15. They wrote each other frequently in the years after but Elvira became wrapped up in a life that demanded much of her and rarely left Penance where she settled.   Ian’s life beyond childhood is entirely open aside from the fact that at some point through his life he became infected by the bite of a were-creature that slowed his aging tremendously. Face claim is totally open though it’d be cool if we could find someone that makes them believable siblings (just because he’s technically younger doesn’t mean he has to look it anymore). I’m not overly attached to Elvira’s maiden name of Porter or the name Ian so we can definitely come up with something you may like better if the ad interests you otherwise. That said I’m liable to be a little picky about it so forgive me. Besides that the world is your oyster.,2024-07-09 11:01:19 GMT

Dean’s ready even eager to sacrifice himself to a fate worse than death; Sam can’t take it and breaks down after sticking out the quiet stoicism thing for most of the season; Castiel’s not taking it and angrily calls Dean out (without beating the shit out of him this time). And for once it’s Dean who backs down letting his little brother need him.  Personal growth all around everyone using their words only for Jack to quietly go and lose his way the moment he gets his superpowers back. Donatello gave him good advice on making moral calls while soulless - what would the Winchesters (or Mr Rogers) do? - but forgot he was talking to a two-year-old incapable of applying it with any great insight. And Cas witnessed Jack’s first chilly-logic slip into murderous mercy without confronting him? After Cas put all his faith in what Jack’s meant to become?

I am also open to debate particulary as i am not a lesbian so i dont want to talk over their voices so if anynoje feels any different to me please comment ande explain your reasrons i would love to hesr them.  &lt;!-- more --&gt;   To me Charlie Bradbury is solely written as the female version of Dean. She lacks development and her own true character. Although I don’t believe it is inherently wrong to have parallels and similarities between characters especially since there s a brother sister dynamic. I acknowledge that the similarities are most likely used to develop a bond between Dean and Charlie and to further propel the found family trope. As well as this is not a critique on Felica Day’s performance I think she is a brilliant actor and I am not faulting her acting rather the way her character was written.  My main issues is that she sexualises women and objectifies them. This is also a critique I have of dean but I think this is more to take note of from Charlie as she is a woman so it would feel as if she would understand how uncomfortable it is to be viewed in that light. Referencing a porn star and although this was the dark side of her being a “player” towards women in a frat boy kinda way. As well as we have seen her objectify women in the past (I.e. crude comments and staring) . I am not saying that lesbians/Sapphic women can’t do these things. However to me it feels as if instead of writing and in depth character that Charlie deserved we got discounted female version of Dean Winchester.  I am aware that she is a nerd and has many interests in geeky things. But once again this is a trait shown in Dean which has just been a trope pushed further by Charlie. Her being a hacker was for the most part one of her only unique abilities and assets she brought to the Winchesters.  Saying this however I found Charlie’s character much more interesting post-apocalypse. She finally becomes stand alone character that I longed to see more of. Even when she finally started to become her own as a leader of the resistance. We rarely see her as a leader on screen most of her actions being alluded to instead. Charlie like almost every other character in supernatural was wasted potential. It’s not that she was a bad character per say but that she was unoriginal as a concept. She was boring and predicable when the sow needed contrast and something more original.,2024-07-09 13:50:16 GMT

And the characters omg the characters they’re so messy and so dramatic and they’re all so sad and I love them and it’s so nice to see other people also love them and see similar or even new things in characters I also love!   Idk it’s just something I feel is missing from my main socials (that being instagram) and unfortunately none of my friends have watched Supernatural (Yet. It’s going to happen.) so I’m sort of missing that connection I suppose.

What started as just picking a long ass show I had some morbid curiosity about because of one of the characters getting sent to superhell for being gay where I couldn’t even remember the characters name but somehow remember he was played by Misha Collins has now basically become a cornerstone of my journey as an artist and the thing that pushed me to finally start seriously pursuing writing!   Saying all this I haven’t actually finished the show yet I’m currently on S12 and no doubt I will continue to be angry at the absolute shenanigans this show will pull but honestly if I’ve stuck around for 12 already what’s another three?   And when the writers do something I really hate? Well I have my lovely ocs who are totally not based on Dean and Cas and are definitely not just so I can live in the delusion that in some universe destiel is real.

Back at the bunker Dean sat at the table drinking his beer when Cas approached him. Cas studied Dean’s bruised face with concern then gently rested his hand on Dean’s cheek. Dean instantly relaxed leaning into Cas’ touch as he felt himself healing and not just physically.   “Cas I-” Dean started to speak but Sam entered the room interrupting him. Cas withdrew his hand taking a step back.  “Great Cas healed you. Now it’s your turn to run an errand” Sam said to his brother.   Dean rolled his eyes standing up. “Wanna come with?” he asked Cas hoping for a moment alone with him. Cas nodded.  Dean kept glancing at Cas while driving it was always funny to him how laser focused Cas looked even when nothing alarming was happening. Dean took Cas’ hand in his and said “You need to relax a little”.   Cas tilted his head in confusion “What do you mean?”.   Dean chucked and replied “You know loosen up a little you survived freaking LUCIFER man.”  “Then what do you suggest I should do?”  There were a lot of suggestions in Dean’s mind but he let those slide for now.  When they reached the store Dean realised he had been holding Cas’ hand the entire ride. And the best part was that Cas let him. It wasn’t awkward it simply felt natural. Cas gave him his half-smile then looked at their hands held together and delicately traced his thumb over Dean’s hand. Everything around seemed to fade away and Dean just wanted to stay in this moment forever.,2024-07-09 11:31:00 GMT

1,Supernatural,['nym finally watched supernatural'  'spn'  'supernatural meta'  'castiel'  'jimmy novak'],nym-wibbly,nym_wibbly | Sweet summer child (that mass murderer Castiel)  I just skipped back to the start of Supernatural season five (from fourteen) to refresh my memory about how Nick/Lucifer’s arc began. Accidentally landed on the scene in the hospital where Castiel having picked his side at the end of S4 complains that he “killed two angels this week”. Oh bby.  The show’s never delved deeply into that aspect of Castiel’s storyline. He’s feared and loathed by other angels but we’ve seen little of how he feels about that. Few characters can get a rise out of him under any provocation so we just get occasional glimpses of his fear and anger when one of the Winchesters goes recklessly suicidal and makes Cas afraid his sacrifices are in vain and his faith misplaced. He needs to feel that it’s been worth it and panics when that gets hard. He’s killed so many of his own kind both in combat and when he went nuclear at the start of S7. He’s been significantly responsible for the genocide and near extinction of the angels both through personal kills and through his epic hubris in seasons 6 7 and 9.  He feels the guilt and shame he undergoes atonement and he learns to do and be better - but he keeps on killing angels when he needs to. All that slaughter yet I truly believed him when he told Nick that it’s the personal human tragedy of Jimmy Novak and family - the unintended consequence of his ignorance and blind faith his angelic innocence - that metaphorically speaking keeps Cas awake at night. That was just raw for him and Nick touched a nerve while the fate of Heaven in which he’s taken a conscious part is a dull burden that Cas carries and owns without outward displays of overwhelming emotion.  It ought to come over as a terrible terrifying zealotry on Castiel’s part - the kind that tips the balance from hero to antihero/villain and the kind of cold absolutism he consciously walked away from at the end of S4 when Dean challenged him to choose between right and wrong instead of relying on blind faith but it doesn’t read that way. His self-doubt is infinitely more dangerous to bystanders - to his friends - than his righteous certainty.  When he succumbs to a dangerous anger in his private trauma he has the insight to isolate himself and when that fails he has the self-awareness to stop short of beating the helpless Metatron to death because he can still draw a clear distinction between an enemy and a threat. He knows how dangerous he is and warns people when it’s viable to do so. He does everything in his power to see that he’s safely restrained when Rowena’s slavering-killer spell overtakes him when he knows the choice is going to be taken out of his hands. The rest of the time his self-control is epic. Even the tired kind and caring dad!Cas of season 13/14 is first and foremost a soldier making a soldier’s choices with a soldier’s strategy a defender rather than an aggressor. Somehow even with the shocking death toll he’s racked up he’s a protector figure not something out of a nightmare. Just like the Winchesters.  It’s like he’s helpless to prevent his part in harming Heaven even as he’s the one stabbing and exploding his siblings all over the place. Mind you the other angels never learn. They keep coming at him with pointy things and/or threatening the Winchesters and when they do occasionally manage to take him off the board Chuck puts him right back. As of S14 even Naomi seems to have grasped that making Castiel choose between his own kind and his adopted family isn’t a survival strategy. I’m not optimistic that any of the angels (bar semi-angelic Jack I guess) will be left standing by the series finale. The shape of the story seems to demand that they move over to make way for a better tomorrow - along with God. But if God’s the one writing the story it’s unlikely to be that simple!  Poor (killy stabby fallen fratricidal) Castiel.,2024-06-18 06:45:00 GMT

I am also open to debate particulary as i am not a lesbian so i dont want to talk over their voices so if anynoje feels any different to me please comment ande explain your reasrons i would love to hesr them.  &lt;!-- more --&gt;   To me Charlie Bradbury is solely written as the female version of Dean. She lacks development and her own true character. Although I don’t believe it is inherently wrong to have parallels and similarities between characters especially since there s a brother sister dynamic. I acknowledge that the similarities are most likely used to develop a bond between Dean and Charlie and to further propel the found family trope. As well as this is not a critique on Felica Day’s performance I think she is a brilliant actor and I am not faulting her acting rather the way her character was written.  My main issues is that she sexualises women and objectifies them. This is also a critique I have of dean but I think this is more to take note of from Charlie as she is a woman so it would feel as if she would understand how uncomfortable it is to be viewed in that light. Referencing a porn star and although this was the dark side of her being a “player” towards women in a frat boy kinda way. As well as we have seen her objectify women in the past (I.e. crude comments and staring) . I am not saying that lesbians/Sapphic women can’t do these things. However to me it feels as if instead of writing and in depth character that Charlie deserved we got discounted female version of Dean Winchester.  I am aware that she is a nerd and has many interests in geeky things. But once again this is a trait shown in Dean which has just been a trope pushed further by Charlie. Her being a hacker was for the most part one of her only unique abilities and assets she brought to the Winchesters.  Saying this however I found Charlie’s character much more interesting post-apocalypse. She finally becomes stand alone character that I longed to see more of. Even when she finally started to become her own as a leader of the resistance. We rarely see her as a leader on screen most of her actions being alluded to instead. Charlie like almost every other character in supernatural was wasted potential. It’s not that she was a bad character per say but that she was unoriginal as a concept. She was boring and predicable when the sow needed contrast and something more original.,2024-07-09 13:50:16 GMT

He had narrowly avoided getting shoved into a piece of rebar sticking out of a support beam in the seedy and dilapidated barn. Something that would’ve been fatal.  Dropping Sam back at the Bunker Dean pointed the Impala northeast. It would take him eight hours but he needed to go he needed her.   Never in his life had he felt this way this pull to another person. Even with Lisa he’d never felt this way; the need the want the desire to be in their presence.   But Donna wasn’t Lisa. No Donna knew the intricate parts of his life his job. She knew that no news was good news so he didn’t feel obliged to give her a call to update her all the time.  Not like with Lisa. Lisa always wanted to know his every location his every move. Yes she knew about his job seeing as Dean is the one that saved her son from the Changeling that was terrorizing her town but the constant checking in and her incessant need to know every detail of his days. It was overwhelming and made her unattractive.   It killed their relationship before it really began.  But Donna wasn’t like that. She understood the life. Probably better than anyone ever had. Except Sam.  Dean didn’t even bother calling Donna to tell her he was heading her way he didn’t have to. Their arrangement wasn’t like that.  She hadn’t alerted him before she showed up at the Bunker three months ago. Didn’t mean he wasn&#x27;ts exhilarated to see her. And he proved it when Sam went out for some hippy-dippy show across town.  He’d fucked her on almost every surface in the underground shelter in appreciation.  He knows when he doesn’t see her vehicle in the driveway that she’s still at work. That’s okay though; Donna had given him a key to the door.  So after parking Baby in the garage he grabs his duffel hoping there’s at least one clean set of clothes in there because honestly he doesn’t remember the last time he changed it out.  He gets in with no problem and heads straight to the shower. He’s dirty sweaty and stinky.   He is standing under the shower reveling in the fantastic water pressure when something catches his attention. A sound that he can’t quite decipher.  But then the curtain is ripped open and he smiles at what he sees. Donna fucking Hanscum stands in front of the hunter completely nude with a blinding smile on her face.  “Hey-a! This is a great surprise” she says as she steps into the stall with Dean her hand rubbing up his arm across his shoulder and cups the side of his head.  “Wanted to come see my girl” Dean says as he leans into her touch.  Donna’s legs are wrapped around his hips and her back is pressed into the shower wall as he rails into her his dick spearing her cervix. Her moans are music to his ears.   Neither of them pay any mind that the water has turned frigid the heat from both of their bodies keeping the lovers warm.  Dean can feel his end approaching but he staves it off because he can feel that Donna is right there: right on the precipice of one of the best orgasms of her life.  He slips a hand between them and starts rubbing her bud.   “Come on D” he murmurs. “Let go. You’re right there baby. That tight pussy is squeezing me so hard. Cum for me.”  He leans back and watches as the blonde’s eyes roll back and her body tenses. Then he feels it. Her warm juices coat his cock and splash against his groin.  Donna goes limp but Dean is ready for it he knew she would lose all cognition after a climax that strong; he holds her tight slowing his thrusts until she regain consciousness.   As soon as her blue eyes open he smiles. “There’s my pretty girl. You okay?”  “Oophta. I think I died” Donna says with a giggle.   “Nah sweetheart you just squirted” Dean explains. “Was that your first time?”  “You betcha. It was……awesome!”  Dean smiles and kisses her lips. “Let’s see if I can get you to do it again.”  He begins pounding into her willing body again his fingers massaging and gently squeezing her quivering clit.  Unfortunately Dean meets his end before he can accomplish what he sat out to do but only because Donna starts whispering complete filth in his ear and he can’t hold it in.  “Come on Dean give me all that cock. God it feels good to be stretched around your dick.”  “Fucking my brains out takes on a whole new meaning when Dean Winchester is inside you. Fill me up baby. Shoot all that cum deep inside my cunt.”  “Maybe later we could play around with some of my toys? Oh you like that? Umph! Wanna fuck me with my pink dildo?”  “Oh god Dean! Please fill me up!”  Dean thrusts in to the hilt as he feels his cum explode from his body and floods Donna’s pussy.  They laugh together as they both clean up in water that feels like it was piped in straight from Antarctica.  Once out of the shower they dry off and both fall into bed completely nude and go to sleep.     The next morning Donna wakes to an empty bed. Or so she thought until she feels Dean’s tongue flicking her clit.  “Good morning to me!” she exclaims as she looks down to see a tuft of spiky brown hair between her thighs.  Dean hums against her then sucks the nub into his lips.   Donna reaches down and spreads her labia to give him better access to her most intimate area.   Dean takes his right hand from her thigh and inserts a finger as he continues lavishing her clit with the most sinful attention  Hearing her moans and gasps spurs Dean on and he quickly adds another digit to the mix; scissoring her open until he could add a third.  Donna is vibrating from his ministrations her body shuddering from the pleasure.  “Fuck!” Dean exclaims taking his mouth off of her and looking down. “I’ve got my whole damn fist in your pussy Don! God damn! That’s hot.”  Donna whimpers but doesn’t say anything as she begins undulating her hips.  “You want me to fuck you with my fist? See if I can get my arm in there?”  “Umhmm” Donna moans her bottom lip trapped by her teeth.  Dean begins pumping his wrist and flexing his fingers and goes back to nibbling on the soppy cunt in front of him.  He had never met anyone that would even consider this. He didn’t think it was possible but as he uncurls his fingers and plays with Donna’s inside walls he was glad that it’s Donna who allowed it.   She was a friend a colleague an ally.  His dick strains against the mattress as he listens to Donna’s moans of pleasure and satisfaction.   He grazes her clit with his teeth and Donna springs up to a sitting position trapping his wrist underneath her.  “Holy shit!”  “You like that?” Dean smiles up at her his lips wet with her arousal.  “Yea” Donna says dreamily.  “I’m glad and I’ll do it again” he tells her. “But baby you’re breaking my wrist.”  “Oh!” Donna says as she realizes what she’s done. She lies back and Dean reluctantly withdraws from her body.  As he rubs his wrist with his other hand he shifts off the end of the mattress. Before he gets too far he is surprised when Donna drops to her knees on the floor and takes his cock in her hand.  “I’ve never thought this about any others but you got the prettiest dick ever Winchester. I just want to eat it up.”  Dean can’t help but chuckle. “What’s stopping ya darlin’?”     @spnbaby-67 @sea040561 @delightfullykrispypeach @larajadeschmidt13 @atc74  @vicariouslythruspn @squirrelnotsam @sandlee44 @blacktithe7 @hoboal87  @mogaruke @supraveng @akshi8278 @lyarr24 @kazsrm67  @chriszgirl92 @deanwithscissors @raisinggray @fanfic-n-tabulous @hobby27  @stoneyggirl2 @purpleeclipseeggsland @kmc1989 @leigh70   @foxyjwls007 @dingo-ate-my-hot-lettuce-crazy @perpetualabsurdity   @kickingitwithkirk @deans-spinster-witch @krazykelly @nancymcl,2024-07-09 15:26:37 GMT

Series Masterlist here!! &amp; Main masterlist here!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Texas here we come.  I felt a mix of nerves anxiety and fear about making this move but after last night’s events my excitement skyrocketed.  When we broke the news to the kids this morning their reactions exceeded our expectations. Katie bubbled with enthusiasm about endless sleepovers and tea parties while Kevin surprisingly was genuinely happy even hugging his dad which caught us off guard.  We said goodbye to my family at the house; I didn’t want another goodbye at the airport after the emotional night we had. Despite forgiving most of them I was eager to start this new chapter with my new family just us.  Later that afternoon we arrived in Texas dropped off the kids at their mom’s and headed to our new home together. I was thrilled but beneath Jensen’s apparent happiness something was bothering him I could tell.   As we unloaded our belongings and settled into our new bedroom his smile seemed strained his eyes filled with unspoken worry.   Giving him space I patiently helped unpack until I couldn’t ignore his unease any longer. I approached him sitting on the bed gently touching his cheek as he leaned into my hand. “Are you okay?” I asked softly.  He sighed his expression conflicted. “Sort of.”  “What’s bothering you?” I pressed gently.  He stood running a hand through his hair. “I don’t want to ruin today with my issues honey. It’s okay really.”  Shaking my head I stood beside him taking his hand in mine. “You’re not ruining anything. Please tell me what’s on your mind.”  Avoiding my gaze he grasped my arms. “It’s just… Fuck it’s so stupid.” he paused before chuckling at himself in embarrassment. “I thought i’d come home with you and the house would feel fresh but I can’t shake it.”  Understanding dawned on me “You mean what happened with Sarah?”  He nodded sadly in response avoiding my eyes like he was ashamed.  I hugged him tightly to me my heart aching for his struggle. “I understand triggers and anxiety is tough I don’t blame you.”  He lifted his head to meet my eyes remorse clouding his face. “I’m sorry. It’s not fair. This should be our happy day and I’m ruining with my own shit.”  “No Jensen” I insisted sitting beside him. “Your feelings are valid. The chaos you went through here before-of course it’s hard to forget and of course that would bring up anxious feelings.”  He sighed heavily sitting on the edge of the bed. “I don’t get it. I’ve moved on but being here… my chest is tight and I feel like i’m going to have a panic attack.”  Squeezing his hand I offered comfort. “It’s normal to have these reactions. This place holds memories good and bad. What your dealing with now is a trigger. You might have forgiven and moved on but this place holds memories good and bad and it’s normal to have these reactions especially when you return to the place where the pain originated in the first place.”  His hand ran through his hair his fingers trembling. His chest rose and fell unevenly each breath coming quicker than the last. I moved in close feeling the tension radiating off him and placed my hand firmly against his back my lips brushing against his ear.  “Hey Jensen you’re okay.” I whispered urgently. “Just take a deep breath.”  He nodded frantically but his breaths came in short gasps his chest heaving with each inhale. I could feel the shudders running through him as he struggled to regain control. Gripping his shoulders I urged him softly “Deep breaths Jensen. In… and out.”  He attempted to follow my lead but his breath hitched painfully his body betraying his efforts. Tears welled up in his eyes his whole frame shaking uncontrollably. With each passing moment his panic seemed to escalate his grip on reality slipping.  But I was patient and determined to see him through this constantly whispering reassurances in his ear making sure he knew that he wasn’t alone.  Finally he managed a breath holding it desperately before letting it out in a shuddering exhale. His shoulders relaxed slightly but the panic still lingered in his eyes. When he turned his head towards me his face was pale beads of sweat glistening on his forehead. A weak grin tugged at his lips as he whispered thickly “Thank you honey.”  I brushed his cheek gently trying to calm the storm raging inside him. “You don’t have to thank me” I murmured softly. “I’m right here with you.”  Several hours later Jensen’s mood had improved.  We continued unpacking; it didn’t take much since I didn’t have many belongings. Jensen took the initiative to order new bed sheets blankets and anything else that had been shared with Sarah.   While I appreciated the gesture I knew it was more for Jensen’s benefit-a fresh start. It was something that that we both needed.  And that’s when a thought crossed my mind. A dirty hot and exciting thought. Maybe we needed to replace the feelings here give each other a memory that we could hold onto forever.   Jensen was in the kitchen putting away the dishes when I escaped to the bedroom changing into the only piece of lingerie I owned and internally thanking myself for buying it even when I thought I’d never use it.  I have never worn something like this before there was never a chance and my body confidence wasn’t strong enough to show it off but tonight I was determined to give Jensen an image he wouldn’t soon forget.  I pulled on the black and pink laced bra and tightened it before sliding on the matching pink panties. I stood in the mirror as I pulled on the fishnets that went with it blowing a breath at the image staring back at me in the mirror.   Even without the full confidence I knew Jensen was going to be blown away by my outfit choice.   As I came back into the kitchen Jensen’s back was turned towards me and I smiled nervously. I cleared my throat and Jensen turned his head slightly but not enough to see me. “Doing good honey?” He questioned.  I laughed lightly and leaned against the counter to give him a nice view if he would ever turn around. “Yeah I’m good. I’ll be better in a few minutes.”  He chuckled deeply “Oh yeah? Why’s that?”  This time I laughed loudly and shook my head. “Well if you’d ever turn around you’d know.”  He tossed the towel down and finally turned towards me his eyes locking in on my body a deep blush spread from his ears to his cheeks. His mouth gaped open as he sucked in a breath.  “Oh.. wow. Holy shit Y/N… you look…. Wow.”  I smiled shly my cheeks burning red at his compliments. With a sudden urge of confidence I walked around the counter standing in front of him to show it off. My fingers traced up and down his chest eyes trailing with it. I smirked and leaned to his ear. “Wait till you see the back.”  He swallowed hard as I turned around giving him a nice clear view. He groaned underneath his breath and I could feel him watching me staring at every piece of skin he could see. “My god you are just… gorgeous. I’m a lucky man.”  I giggled and turned back towards him “Well I was thinking maybe we both could be lucky. Maybe we could christen every room in this house start our new life with some good memories.”  He nodded frantically and pulled me close nails digging into my hips tightly. “I’m game.”  I smirked and moved to the counter my back against him. “Well I was thinking maybe here first… you could fuck me against our new kitchen island…”  His breathing hitched and before I could say anything his hands moved to my ass pulling me towards him. He leaned closer to my ear his voice going raspy and deep. “You want me to bend you over and fuck you right here dirty girl?”  I bit my lip to stifle the moan and nodded before his fingers laced in my hair pulling me back until my back was flush against his chest. “Words honey.”  “Yes… Yes I want you to fuck me right here.”  He stayed silent but the sound of his belt sliding out of the loops sent shivers down my spine. Jensen usually wasn’t dominating in bed but it was certainly a nice change of events.  His hand moved to the back of my neck as he pushed me down on the counter a gasp leaving my lips as the cold tile pressed against my skin and cheek. “Put your hands on the sides of the counter and hold on.” he demanded.  I quickly did as he said waiting in anticipation for him to give me what I so desperately needed but he was taking his time.   His fingers traced lower gently pressing over top my panties causing me to squirm in my spot. He groaned in his throat and leaned over me kissing my back gently. “You’re already soaked you really like this eh?”  I nodded and breathed deep trying to hold back begging him to fuck me but I was ready to. He chuckled under his throat as he watched me squirm his hands moving back to my hips as he moved my panties to the side. “Ready?”  I just started to nod my head when his cock slammed deep inside of me causing my body to shoot forward against the counter and a loud moan to escape my throat. He groaned loudly gripping me impossibly tight. “Fuck you feel good.”  He panted against me as he thrusted harder desperate to fill me as much as he possibly could. He was relentless and rough in such a good way pounding me over and over again hips slamming against mine pushing and pressing and fucking me so hard.  It felt like we was punishing me like he hated me and I loved it. I knew he loved me I knew that he wasn’t taking anything out on me but it felt freeing to have him completely in control demanding my body taking what was his.   My hands were going white against the counter every slam was starting to ache on my stomach to the point where pain was radiating through me. I lifted my head dizzily and turned towards him “Jensen…”  He slowed his movements and leaned over me brushing the hair from my face “You okay?”  I nodded and rested my head back down “Just… the counter.”  He slowly pulled out of me as his hand came to my arms spinning me around gently. He smiled and bent lower grabbing my thighs to lift me up.  As gently as possible he picked me up and brought me to the ktichen table before laying me down on my back. I sighed contently and he smirked hand moving down to stroke his hard cock before he slid back inside me in one quick motion.   I leaned my head back and whimpered as he filled me up to the point where I didn’t think he could reach any further but every thrust every movement felt like he was hitting spots I didn’t realize were there.   He leaned over me hands grabbing mine to hold them in place against the table. “This is better anyways I like seeing your gorgeous face as I fuck you.”  My eyes slammed shut as his words brought me closer to the edge every word that rolled off his tongue pushed me further and further. “Oh fuck Jensen please more.”  His hands pulled down on my hips forcing me closer and himself deeper inside me causing my eyes to roll back and my hands to grip his tightly. He groaned loudly as he watched me fall apart desperate to get me there.  “Oh fuck you’re so fucking sexy sweetheart.” he spoke hungrily. I nodded and opened my eyes my hand reaching for the back of his head to pull him lower. He smirked as his eyes glanced on my lips kissing me passionatly.  I could feel the pleasure crashing through my entire body legs shaking with pleasure and hot white lights exploding before my eyes I was almost there and I just needed a push. He groaned as his forehead dropped against mine. “Fuck I love fucking you like this.”  “Please Jensen..” I choked out barely audible.   He lifted his head as his hand came to my cheek “What do you need baby?”  “I’m so close..”  He nodded in understanding as he sat up gently pulling my legs over his shoulders to get as deep as he could. His other hand moved down to my clit rubbing so roughly that I saw stars.   “I’m right behind you baby cum for me.”  I closed my eyes tight as I felt the coil start to snap my vision went dark and the entire world around me was spinning rotating like I was about to fall off but Jensen’s grip tightened he wasn’t going to let go.  His groans grew louder as he thrusted deep inside of me pushing me to the edge completely. We fell apart together and when he stilled the room was filled with breathy gasps for air and love and passion coating us.   He gently pulled out before grabbing a towel to clean me up grabbing my hands to sit me up from my spot. He leaned closer bright lust blown eyes staring back at me. “Are you okay?”  I nodded lazily as my eyes fluttered. “Yeah I’m good just.. exhausted.”  He smirked and helped me to my feet holding me tightly against him.  “Well why don’t we go take a nap and than we can see how many other rooms we can have fun in.”  I giggled playfully and nodded “I’m game.”  He laughed loudly and walked us towards the bedroom. “That’s my line.”  Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it!

A/N: This is going to be the last chapter of this series; I decided that the story went exactly the direction I wanted it to and I think that I’m satisfied with a sweet happy ending because I think that’s what the characters deserve.  Series Masterlist here!! &amp; Main masterlist here!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; A month has passed since Jensen and I had settled into our new life our lives were filled with a newfound joy and stability. Day by day Jensen became brighter more comfortable with letting love and happiness in.   For a while I had no idea what to do here unsure of what career path to take but the more I listened to Jensen and understood his trauma the closer I was to figuring out my true calling.   I enrolled in school to become a therapist receiving endless support from Jensen who thought it was perfect for me and I agreed. My life felt right it felt like I found my home and my family.  Jensen landed a role in a new TV show bringing a new found sense of appreciation for his life and himself. Despite his busy schedule he always made time for simple joys like breakfast with the entire family and walks in their neighbourhood.   The kids adjusted well to their new life here half the time with their mom and half the time with Jensen and I. Even Sarah and I got closer we would invite each other to morning coffee and take the kids to the park our bound over the love we had for the children blossomed into a genuine friendship that only enriched our blended family.  Under the Texas sky painted with beautiful shades of orange and pink Jensen and I sat in our backyard cuddled into each other embracing the moment with each other.  “I can’t believe we made it here.” Jensen whispered his voice filled with admiration as he looked around at the peaceful surroundings.   I leaned into his shoulder feeling his warmth against mine. “It feels unreal doesn’t it?”  He nodded in response his eyes softening as he gazed into mine. “A dream I never want to end.”  “You know” she began her voice filled with emotion “I never thought we’d go from neighbours who didn’t get along to this.”  Jensen chuckled gently brushing a hair from my face and stepping closer. “Y/N.” he began his voice gentle yet filled with emotions. “When we first met I didn’t realize how much you would change my life. I was closed off pushing away love because I was afraid and hurt. But you with your constant kindness and openness your unwavering belief in us you saved me from becoming a man I really didn’t want to be you saved me from giving up on love all together and I’m not sure what I did to deserve you but I’m grateful.”  I turned towards him my heart swelling with love and appreciation for the journey we had traveled together. I took a deep breath and pulled him closer. “You showed me what love truly means.”   His head dropped as nerves flowed through him “I pushed it away convinced myself I didn’t deserve it. But you you taught me how to love again how to open my heart and let someone in completly.”  I could feel the tears pouring down my cheeks overwhelmed by the intensity of his words and the genuine love in his voice. Before I could say anything Jensen reached into his pocket pulling out a small box and dropping to his knee. He opened it slowly revealing a gorgeous diamond ring that sparkled in the soft candlelight.  “Y/N Will you marry me?” He whispered his voice filled with hope and vulnerability. “Will you continue to be my light my love my everything?”  Unable to find words I nodded and jumped on him sending us tumbling to the ground laughter and tears mixed in the air. “Is that a yes?”  I nodded and kissed him over and over “Yes of course yes. You’re all I want.”  In this serene moment under the stars we hung onto each-other tightly knowing that we found forever in each-other’s arms. The stars above seemed to shine brighter celebrating our love story and the promise of a future filled with endless love.   Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it!

Sam wears woman’s underwear. 🤣🤣🤣  I never realised that Sam did keep in touch with his college buddies for a while after Jess died  Apparently for his friends he is supposed to be on roadtrip with his brother  Ironic how Sam calls Dean antisocial and Dean tell him he can’t have relationships in this line of work and few seasons down the line we see Dean having good bonds with Jody Donna Claire Krissy and other fellow hunters but Sam has no one  Sam being sharp as fuck and realising Dean’s not Dean because of missing car keys and bummed shoulder  Why does shifter!Dean look like just Dean? What were Jensen’s directions here? Be Dean but angrier? I struggled to tell them apart. Maybe that was the point idk  Lol Sam’s face when Dean says at least he picked the handsome one. Sit down brother it’s gonna be your face on wanted posters  Why did the shapeshifter tie a rope around Sam’s throat but not Dean’s? Kinda kinky fuckery if you ask me  That one scene where Sam is tied up and lying down on the floor. Why? Weren’t you sitting? Tired? Or they just decided he looked pretty lying on the floor and tied up?  The tender way Rebecca (Sam’s friend) cradles his face (yes there’s a gif below!),2024-07-09 18:47:11 GMT

A/N: This is going to be the last chapter of this series; I decided that the story went exactly the direction I wanted it to and I think that I’m satisfied with a sweet happy ending because I think that’s what the characters deserve.  Series Masterlist here!! &amp; Main masterlist here!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; A month has passed since Jensen and I had settled into our new life our lives were filled with a newfound joy and stability. Day by day Jensen became brighter more comfortable with letting love and happiness in.   For a while I had no idea what to do here unsure of what career path to take but the more I listened to Jensen and understood his trauma the closer I was to figuring out my true calling.   I enrolled in school to become a therapist receiving endless support from Jensen who thought it was perfect for me and I agreed. My life felt right it felt like I found my home and my family.  Jensen landed a role in a new TV show bringing a new found sense of appreciation for his life and himself. Despite his busy schedule he always made time for simple joys like breakfast with the entire family and walks in their neighbourhood.   The kids adjusted well to their new life here half the time with their mom and half the time with Jensen and I. Even Sarah and I got closer we would invite each other to morning coffee and take the kids to the park our bound over the love we had for the children blossomed into a genuine friendship that only enriched our blended family.  Under the Texas sky painted with beautiful shades of orange and pink Jensen and I sat in our backyard cuddled into each other embracing the moment with each other.  “I can’t believe we made it here.” Jensen whispered his voice filled with admiration as he looked around at the peaceful surroundings.   I leaned into his shoulder feeling his warmth against mine. “It feels unreal doesn’t it?”  He nodded in response his eyes softening as he gazed into mine. “A dream I never want to end.”  “You know” she began her voice filled with emotion “I never thought we’d go from neighbours who didn’t get along to this.”  Jensen chuckled gently brushing a hair from my face and stepping closer. “Y/N.” he began his voice gentle yet filled with emotions. “When we first met I didn’t realize how much you would change my life. I was closed off pushing away love because I was afraid and hurt. But you with your constant kindness and openness your unwavering belief in us you saved me from becoming a man I really didn’t want to be you saved me from giving up on love all together and I’m not sure what I did to deserve you but I’m grateful.”  I turned towards him my heart swelling with love and appreciation for the journey we had traveled together. I took a deep breath and pulled him closer. “You showed me what love truly means.”   His head dropped as nerves flowed through him “I pushed it away convinced myself I didn’t deserve it. But you you taught me how to love again how to open my heart and let someone in completly.”  I could feel the tears pouring down my cheeks overwhelmed by the intensity of his words and the genuine love in his voice. Before I could say anything Jensen reached into his pocket pulling out a small box and dropping to his knee. He opened it slowly revealing a gorgeous diamond ring that sparkled in the soft candlelight.  “Y/N Will you marry me?” He whispered his voice filled with hope and vulnerability. “Will you continue to be my light my love my everything?”  Unable to find words I nodded and jumped on him sending us tumbling to the ground laughter and tears mixed in the air. “Is that a yes?”  I nodded and kissed him over and over “Yes of course yes. You’re all I want.”  In this serene moment under the stars we hung onto each-other tightly knowing that we found forever in each-other’s arms. The stars above seemed to shine brighter celebrating our love story and the promise of a future filled with endless love.   Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it!

2,Supernatural,['ymmv'  'starting to process the box i closed during season uh nine?'],witchy-self-shipper,Wow so the more I hear about SPN now as opposed to when it was freshly over I guess the more grateful I am to have given it up.  The characters still exist somewhere inside of me in a hotel room in Kansas stitching themselves up I imagine recovering and deciding what they want to do and who they want to be in my universe because I do still love the potential I saw in them early on…   But it does sound like the whole Powers that be for SPN really just didn’t love or care about their characters didn’t have a real plot weren’t really storytelling it was all whumper/whumpee and no caretaker all hurt no comfort money and fame and just twisting the knife and feeding the addiction and raking in the money or something?  I don’t tend to talk SPN because I get such horrible backlash when I don’t worship it… but I’m starting to hear more people talk about it… realistically? critically? Something.  IDK. YMMV.,2024-07-09 19:56:51 GMT

I’ve been reading a lot of Sam as Jack’s father figure fanfic which mainly take place during seasons 13 and 14 but all I remember from those seasons is Jack’s relationships with Sam Dean and Cas and Dean’s widower arc because I’ve only seen those seasons once.  Based on all the fanfic I read here’s a summary of what happens: Cas dies while Jack is being born and Mary is missing. Somehow this is Jack’s fault(???). Sam wants to be Jack’s dad and Dean wants to kill Jack. Dean is super depressed until Cas comes back and they play cowboys for an episode. Somehow they end up in an apocalypse world(???) and Sam is killed but brought back by Lucifer. Dean is possessed by Michael and there are a whole bunch of refugees living at the bunker(from where I have no idea). Jack somehow becomes soulless but nobody talks to Sam about how to deal with that despite him being the only person they know who has been soulless and Jack has a pet snake. Either Jack or Dean as Michael or both get locked in a special box. Somehow Jack kills Mary but its Cas’ fault according to Dean(???).,2024-07-09 19:36:13 GMT

CASTIEL WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE AN ANTAGONIST IN A 4-EPISODE STINT OF THE SHOW FOR FUCKS SAKE.   we all fell so deeply in love with the angel who rebelled against everything he’d ever known for dean winchester that the writers literally had to change the story. in the most meta sense we got to witness this story happening in tandem with its power actually altering the real course of the show.   fuck i think about every time jensen and misha thought it would be their last time saying goodbye to each other as cas and dean how even they couldn’t have known at the time the impact these two characters would have in the show and their lives. i think about how they played such a huge role in giving to give us a better story for their characters characters they still love and cherish to this day.   i think about “what’s the matter? you don’t think you deserve to be saved.” i think about castiel watching dean outside lisa’s house. i think about “don’t ever change.” i think about dean carrying the trench coat in the trunk of numerous cars because he couldn’t bear to part with the tiny piece of castiel he had left. i think about “i’m hunted i rebelled and i did it all of it for you.” i think about “i’d rather have you cursed or not.” i think about dean and cas being cain and collette. i think about cas being dean’s big win.   “i like past you.”  “we’re family. we need you. i need you.”  “what broke the connection?”  “the very touch of you corrupts. when castiel first laid a hand on you in hell he was lost!”  “i could go with you.”  “ever since i had to bury him in a ma’lak box.”  “i’m your huckleberry.”  “i heard your prayer.”  “the one thing i want it’s something i know i can’t have.”  “knowing you has changed me.”  “i cared about the whole world because of you.”  “you changed me dean.”  “i love you.”  it’s the most maddening thing in the world to think about how both in real life and in supernatural castiel’s love for dean winchester was so powerful that it broke the intended sequence of events. there will never be another love story like that. there could never be another love story like that.   dean you asked “what about this is all real?” we are.,2024-07-09 20:02:51 GMT

I’ve been reading a lot of Sam as Jack’s father figure fanfic which mainly take place during seasons 13 and 14 but all I remember from those seasons is Jack’s relationships with Sam Dean and Cas and Dean’s widower arc because I’ve only seen those seasons once.  Based on all the fanfic I read here’s a summary of what happens: Cas dies while Jack is being born and Mary is missing. Somehow this is Jack’s fault(???). Sam wants to be Jack’s dad and Dean wants to kill Jack. Dean is super depressed until Cas comes back and they play cowboys for an episode. Somehow they end up in an apocalypse world(???) and Sam is killed but brought back by Lucifer. Dean is possessed by Michael and there are a whole bunch of refugees living at the bunker(from where I have no idea). Jack somehow becomes soulless but nobody talks to Sam about how to deal with that despite him being the only person they know who has been soulless and Jack has a pet snake.

As she covers her face with both hands she feels Dean’s strong arms come to support her as if he knew her knees were about to give in right then and there.  “Alright” He whispers “It’s alright darlin’ it’s gonna be alright.”  She collapses in on him then falling inwards like a house of cards she crumples right into his waiting embrace.  “C&#x27;mere.” Dean hushes as he strokes his hand down the back of her head smoothing her hair down her back in a repeated movement that makes her release an ugly sob into his chest.  -,2024-07-09 22:44:13 GMT

Ace of Spades  MASTERLIST  Summary: Bobby joins in a hunt people are dying of old age at their thirties.   Warnings: Supernatural (and all that comes with it) monsters of all kinds pyrokinesis cursing murder child endangerment impersonating of law enforcers guns thinking about dying (I’m not gonna say ST but close enough) reader contemplates what happens if she is wrong and dies of old age ebcause of magic might miss some warnings  Wordcount: 0 k  Notes: This episode is from the series far along the road but… I want to pump our John with… a bit of life… this includes severely OCC because Bobby and John would never fly with what I’m about to do jeje but hey this is fanfiction I wish I started this after because I wish they were older you know what I mean? In this Dean is 24 and reader 22 so I’m gonna amp the time difference between chapters so they get older quickly jejee  &lt;!-- more --&gt; At night you were in that warehouse again tied. The fear pulled you out of consciousness but when you came to be in the thinnest layers of still sleep you felt Dean’s arms around you comforting you making you relax. But still you felt your body tense  “You alright? you heard Dean whisper  “Just a nightmare” you whispered into the room. You heard John’s light snoring so you knew you had Dean’s undivided attention  “I wanted to kill him Dean” you confessed quietly you heard him take a long breath “I wanted to burn him alive I wanted to make him suffer…”  “Baby…”  “He was right I’m a monster” you whined  “You are not” he said decisively  “I am” you whimpered “if I was free I would have burnt him because I desired it too much”  “You desired it because the sicko was torturing you” he said “I wanted him dead” he said next “and if I could I would have killed him only because of what he was doing to you” you took a long breath trying to shake the dark thought that haunted you “you are not a monster you are not like them you are going to be fine”  “Yes” you whispered  “You need to believe it” he said firmly   …  It bothered you for it to hurt and pinch everytime you moved.   You had healed cuts in seconds but now you had a real injury on your side that it was closing at human speed and it was… infuriating. You didn’t know how Dean and John did it to spend weeks with injuries and cuts they had suffered in cases.  You felt weak  You had a cut across your cheek two in your collarbone area and a stab wound on your left side. The aftermath of the thing the rest had healed completely. You dressed with a turtleneck looking at your own body right now did not sit right with you you didn’t like it   The wound on your face was too fresh to cover it with make up yet so you just leave it. Looking at yourself at the mirror for the last time to get out of there grabbing your things and joining the boys in the parking lot  “We are going to reach Bobby’s tonight” said John “Dean take the Firebird (y/n) you ride with me” you much rather have a karaoke ride with Dean on your car but you were in no mood to fight with John because you were going to lose so you got inside the car with no more quarrel after leaving your bag on the back.  You looked at John when he got in the car. This was the man that saved you and took care of you since then… but you got so nervous when you were alone with him. He was a drill sergeant he was like your commanding officer always had more critics than praise always the “no time to celebrate” party pooper so you always felt nervous and judged when you were in his proximity almost as afraid to move in case he had something negative to say to you. It was a bit intoxicating being in his presence alone for the entire day while you cross Colorado and Nebraska. But again fighting with him is worse.  You were quickly out of the town you had been staying at and you took the 70 towards Colorado  He drew you out of your head by calling your name you raised your eyes to look at him  “What happened to you… can never happen again” he said “you need to be more careful”  “Yes Sir” you said as you haven’t gone over the last days over and over thinking how things could have gone differently if you only did that or this or got in your car first or not letting them go before you or…  “Don’t “yes sir” me” he said not angry but firmly “We haven’t been that scared in…” he sighed “since…” he didn’t finish the sentence but you could guess what he meant “Gordon is known for being relentless he is a good hunter specially for Vampires and I’m afraid now he set his eyes on you he is not going to let go until…”  “Until he gets me again or we kill him” you said bitterly  “He is as vicious as the creatures he hunts” he said “that is why I didn’t took you along with me that day” you nodded  “I understand that now” you said “but I…”  “I have my friends looking for Gordon” he said “luckily I have more friends that he does so if he shows up again we might get a head’s up” you nodded  “I’m sorry for getting you in trouble with another hunter” he almost pumped the brakes right then and there  “Don’t ever do that again that guy is a psychopath and this is in no way shape or form your fault” he said firmly  “He is hunting me because of what I am” you said “and because I’m near you now he’s got beef with all of us”  “That’s on him” he said “did he say anything to you?” he tried  “Besides the occasional threat?” you asked “he said he caught my trace because he found my information on a vampire nest” you said “and he thought at first I was a vampire until he started trailing me and realized I was something else”  “Your information?” he asked  “He found photos and information of places I had been in” you said “he didn’t exactly walked me through what he had seen really”  “This isn’t good” he mumbled “Luthor said he knew you that day when you returned…”  “I’m not afraid of vampires” you said  “Then you are an idiot” he said you got quiet  “It’s not that I’m underestimating them” you said quickly  “Good”  “But I really want to put this away for later I don’t want to deal with the vamps right now and I’m sure as hell I don’t want to keep thinking about that lunatic”  “We will see what Bobby found alright doll? keep your mind off of this for a while” everytime he called you that which was very new you got a tingle in your spine  “That would be good” you said shortly you hugged yourself the awkwardness against settling between you. “How did you find me?” you asked you felt him looking at you “that night?”  “We called everyone I knew who could know that wacko and someone sent us the address” he said shortly.   “The address of a warehouse in the middle of nowhere?” you asked. He said nothing else only kept driving.  You met with Dean at a gas station to refill the tank. He seemed happy to be back on the road  “Your Firebird drives like a dream!” he said with a wide smile  “A big assessment coming from you” you muttered with a shy smile. You looked at the run -down store and the joint next to it  “I need a burger” you muttered and like five shots of tequila if you were gonna gon another half a day with John in the car but it was midday  The men followed you after filling up the tanks and parking.   You had already ordered for them.   You ate in silence you and Dean had always talked freely but with John it was always different he was this thick looming presence that it was almost smothering.   You went back to the cars and you reached Bobby’s at nightfall.  He received you warmly at least Dean and you his preference was obvious  “Let’s hear it Singer” John only said always down to business immediately not joy whatsoever.  You went to lay down for a while you needed some… “time to yourself”  When you finally joined the men beers were out and they were discussing over the table about possible spells curses and others and how it was best to approach the witch.  “So you gamble years of your life with him…” said John “and how do you defeat him… by winning?”  “I don;t know we found this guy who was 90 years old and now he is thirty…”  “So if we play him and loose” said Dean  “You are going to become old”  “So who is playing him?” asked John but nobody offered  “You do know I’m immortal right?” you mocked coming near them and the three of them seemed to have a light bulb going on atop their heads the three of them turned to look at you. “I will play him It doesn’t matter if I lose right?” Dean approached you  “Are you sure you are ready?” he asked you nodded  “Yes” you said simply. “Completely sure” you said with certainty you hated the pity look in Dean’s eyes when he looked at you now  “What if it doesn’t work like that?” asked John “what if you do age?”  “I’ll figure something out” you mumbled “I’m 22 I still got a couple of chips on my name right?” you asked lightly. They didn’t say anything so you continued. “How do you play it?” they stopped in their tracks and turned to look at you  “What?” snapped Dean “you don’t know how to play poker?” he asked  “No” you said as it was the most obvious thing “I do not” and the three of them grumbled annoyed.   …  “I could literally tell you what cards are you holding” said Dean three hours later “You have an non-existing poker face I know exactly what your thoughts are”  “It doesn’t matter what I’m thinking right?” you asked “I have the cards or I don’t” al three men cursed at the same time  “IT IS IMPORTANT!” said Dean throwing the cards over the table “that’s how you win! more than half of this game is about lying!” you growled throwing your own cards  “Can’t I challenge him in a game of go fish or something?” you asked  “NO!” they said at the same time  “This is ridiculous I’m the best at that game I will do it.  …   “I take it you lost” you said softly looking at an eighty year-old Dean. He smiled mockingly and showed you the finger “Gods” you mumbled  “What if we take his chips?” asked Bobby “he has to have something to be the source of his power right?”  “I’m the only one who can beat him” you said “I will not age let’s keep going”  “How do you know?” asked John looking back at you “we don’t know that for certain”  “Even if we don’t we need to get Dean back to his youthful self before he dies of natural causes” you said angrily so you walked towards the table where the deck of cards was still on the tale “rack ‘em” you demanded  “THAT’S POOL!”  …  You didn’t even flinch at the prospect of aging until you died  Because you didn’t really know what was going to happen you only knew about your species because of lore it could be wrong you thought you could age.  You remembered your mother… a bit she did not look twenty one.  So you could age and die if you lost those chips but instead of being fearful of the uncertainty you were calm. As you entered the room and sat in front of the wizard warlock? male witch  “Now what could possibly bring someone as young and beautiful as you here love?” he asked you liked the accent. You only looked back at him with a soft smile.  “Just looking for something thrilling” you said calmly “and to get back my friend’s youth” you said simply. The beautiful woman by his side looked down at him nervously and then at you. She truly didn’t know you knew what you were getting into.  “Oh darling…” he said as he dealt the cards “Oh I get it you are one of those who “have nothing to lose” are you love?” he asked  “Something like that” you said nonchalantly taking another card this game was so boring but Dean was right you had a very “legible” face so you tried to keep it showing what you were feeling boredom.  You were excited when you won the first round grabbing a couple of 25 numbered chips to cash in for Dean. But soon you were losing. Is not that you couldn’t lose meaning you could but… you still needed to get a couple of chips to cash in for Dean.   But you lost miserably and he seemed even guilty. Grabbing the pile of chips from the table.   “I’m sorry” he said with a shit-eating grin you took a long breath and then looked up at him again if you couldn’t win at least now you could negotiate with him. Although the woman seemed really displeased and nervous.   “Cash them” you said simply he frowned at your disposal  “Don’t you have to put your affairs in order or something darling?” he said gently “I can give you a couple of hours  “Cash them” you insisted. He looked doubtful as the woman by his side but he snapped his fingers. Immediately you felt a rush but it wasn’t bad you were looking at your hands over the table and they did not wrinkled or got old they stood the same. And you? you didn’t feel the passing of the 300+ years you had lost you felt invigorated if anything you felt fresher stronger you felt like you had been sleeping for days and woke up a new person. You didn’t feel the pull of the wound on your cheek or your side or the slight burn in your collarbones your wounds were healed   His face was priceless  “What are you?” he asked pleasantly surprised. You were not going to lie to yourself you were indeed scared you didn’t know if the chips were going to make an affect on you but apparently they didn’t. “A fellow witch?” he tried  “No” you said softly “I’m something else” you said simply  “You are no vampire…” he tried you only shook your head “I have to say people come to me knowing exactly what they are getting into…”  “I’m aware” you said softly “But now my friend got old trying to stop you…”  “You want to keep playing?” he asked you barely nodded  So you played  You were at it for hours until you finally gathered a high sum of chips from which you could restore Dean and then some.   You even gave in a couple of more years to him.  You needed to leave.   “I just gave you more than 300 hundred years” you say “can I cash them in for a couple of friends?” you teased he smiled pleasantly “give them a bit of a… rejuvenating treatment?”  “Well you did give me 325 years I guess I can do you a small favor” you smiled widely.  …  When you got out of the dump of a bar they were hiding at Dean a young Dean saw you and whistled catcalling you  “What the hell happened to you?” he asked you didn’t know what it was but you felt great “you actually won?”  “Not really” you said simply you looked beyond Dean to John and Bobby who were looking at each other wide-eyed. Dean followed your eyesight and cursed under his breath  “What the hell did you do?” he asked slowly. John and Bobby got 25 years younger each which meant they were now a couple of years older than yourself and Dean.  “I trade in a couple of hundred years” you said smiling widely. But your smile got wiped out pretty quickly where they going to be mad at you? you didn’t think so they both looked… great… how on hell were you going to explain it to others? how… oh for the gods what have you done!?  But then… they started smiling.   “So now… he is going to stay like that?” asked Dean he seemed as concerned as you. You both looked back at Bobby and John they were talking and then surprising you both they started flexing and chuckling  “Oh Gods” you muttered  “What did we unleash on the world?” asked Dean as sickened as you. But then his gaze turned to you he touched your cheek where your wound was supposed to be “it healed” he said marveled  “I’m 347 years old now” you said matter of factly   “God you’re bad at poker” he chuckled   “Hey dude respect your elders!” you mocked sticking your tongue out. He looked back at you and smiled “What?” you mocked  “It’s good to have you back” he said lightly.  “Yeah only now I’m older wiser stronger…” you said with a wide smile “fuckin’ thrivin”,2024-07-09 23:54:25 GMT

0,Supernatural,['semmwatchlog'],steely-eyedmissileman,Supernatural Ep. 6x10 Caged Heat  so a lot happened this episode. let’s talk it through: meg is a very interesting character. i’m not exactly clear on what her motivations are at this point. i know that crowley intends to kill her but meg is willing to do a heck of a lot of the grunt work for the brothers. she’s willing to die for them which seems quite contrary to her usual routine.  my beloved cas is back and he’s shed some light on the ‘your problems are most important’ line. i think he meant it. at least some part of him did. she outright says that he would rather be here on earth with the winchesters and their bizarre problems than in heaven. he’s doing what he thinks is right because no one else is going to do it. i desperately wish someone else would do it so he could go hang out with his friends.  of course sam doesn’t want his soul back. last episode you told him that having a soul meant suffering and nothing else dean. like come on listen to yourself. and now he knows that his soul is going to be incredibly damaged and possibly destroy him forever… what did you think he was going to do jump for joy? idiot.  and we learn once again that this show is really all about mary. the whole show. how do we bring her back? can we live without her? how does the absence of mary winchester shape the lives of the men around her? once again we’ve met another man who is incapable of living his own story who must coopt mary’s name in order to justify his own actions. the really frustrating part of all of this is that mary herself doesn’t get to have a say in any of the narratives spun around her. everyone is fighting so vehemently over what she would want but no one really knows. it’s not like she could have given instructions for this situation. would she want her father to betray her sons for the possibility of getting her back? we don’t know. would she want her sons to eliminate the possibility of bringing her back to save one of their souls? we just don’t know. everyone is so attached to their idea of her that no one will spare a thought for the actual mary. it’s all about how they feel about her. it’s about a group of men using a woman’s death to further their own narratives. it’s like the writers are fridging mary over and over again. they’ve already done it once but they keep coming back to that fridge letting another man take a look in there and then letting that drive all his actions.,2024-07-09 23:28:02 GMT

It’s embarrassing but she finds that she doesn’t have the energy to care at all. Nor the strength.  “I’m sorry.” She hushes and it settles over the silent forest like a new secret for it to hold.  Dean’s brow is furrowed and Sam’s eyes are sad now both of them looking at her like a puzzle that’s breaking itself apart in front of them. Like they thought they saw the bigger picture but now they’re realising there are a few too many pieces missing.  As she covers her face with both hands she feels Dean’s strong arms come to support her as if he knew her knees were about to give in right then and there.  “Alright” He whispers “It’s alright darlin’ it’s gonna be alright.”  She collapses in on him then falling inwards like a house of cards she crumples right into his waiting embrace.  “C&#x27;mere.” Dean hushes as he strokes his hand down the back of her head smoothing her hair down her back in a repeated movement that makes her release an ugly sob into his chest.  -,2024-07-09 22:44:13 GMT

0,Supernatural,['semmwatchlog'],steely-eyedmissileman,Supernatural Ep. 6x11 Appointment in Samarra  holy shit this was a good episode of television. i’ve said it before and i’m sure i’ll say it again: death is amazing on this show. i think death may be my favorite character. certainly among my favorite characters. the dean and death scenes continue to be some of my favorites. dean had such a rough time in this episode and i’m really glad it went where it did. i knew that sam was going to get his soul back but there have been moments in the past two episodes where it seemed like the kindest thing dean could possibly do was kill sam or leave him this way. it’s something i didn’t say about mary in the last episode and something i think about quite often. why does everyone assume that people want to come back? it seems kinder to let people stay dead at least if they are in heaven. it seems kinder to let them rest.,2024-07-10 00:24:02 GMT
0,Supernatural,['spn'  'spn postcanon'  'supernatural postcanon'  'spn s16'  'supernatural s16'  'supernatural season 16'  'spn season 16'  'spn s18'  'supernatural season 18'  'long post'],catsconflictscopicsandchamomile,Spn postcanon updates:   First of all there’s a big update on the Blatantly Meta side of things that I’m not quite sure how to speak on appropriately. This take on spn postcanon being what it is it both is a massive crossover inevitably MUST include meta/irl stuff relating to the media involved and truly infuriatingly in this case absolutely makes perfect coherent sense with said irl events and even provided perfectly-timed leadup.   That being said in-universe and irl it happened so fast and was devastating in a way that nobody could have predicted.   Lucifer returning to massacre Hell’s lower levels should have been a warning.  The Metatron approaching Frenchfuck over here so blatantly and offering salvation in exchange for information really should have been a warning.  What happened to Ezekiel (an old alias but yknow what? sure) the week before really really REALLY should have been a warning. Even though he was confirmed to have made it back to Heaven almost immediately with commendations for physical-destruction-in-line-of-duty the way it happened should have been a warning I mean he was literally all over the fucking ceiling.   Anyway those safe houses in London and the entities that kept them are destroyed. Scorched earth. So many others were attacked at the same time most of them still not accounted for. So far nobody seems to have survived. “Our side” lost about ¼ of its forces within the past weekend. London Edinburgh PNW possibly any remaining foothold in the House of Nyx and too many individual allies/teams to list. Gabriel was one though.      &lt;!-- more --&gt; Given who was targeted how they were connected various bits of meta/shitposting and of course the actual new antagonist(?) looming in a certain superhero show…  It’s time to admit that the worst is true. Azazel is back and he’s still wearing John.   Between that and that French bastard (no actual name some Fae are just like that) selling the remaining Seasonal Gods out to the Metatron in exchange for some slim chance at surviving the apocalypse anyone surviving is between a rock and a hard place. Azazel’s on the fucking warpath razing entire established safehouses to the ground left and right Metatron is turning his power over “The Word Of God” or whatever against anyone and everyone who could be a threat.  In good news: Sam is officially confirmed at least somewhat free. It seems like a “reverse soulless” situation: Sam’s soul is free along with enough of him to be semi-corporeal. Really that SHOULD be something like a wraith but apparently Sam’s kids magic-ed a way around that. However despite this he’s still very weak if he can take physical form at all while the rest of him is (albeitchanged in appearance at this point) VERY physical notably lacking a soul. …yeah the bodies are starting to stack up. He’s Lady Nemain’s new favorite weapon/toy/arm candy.   OH YEAH I SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE KIDS.  Thankfully these two kids aren’t actually new just yet more inevitable results of early-seasons Winchester horniness… yeah so at least one of them is Ruby’s. She named him   *deep deep sigh*  * C R I N G E *  (I cannot fucking BELIEVE that Walker Texas Ranger of all shows made THIS NAME *AND ITS REASON* canon in the final episode)  …Ruby named him Edward. After Edward from fUCKINg TWILIGHT RUBY WHY WERE YOU *LITERALLY ALWAYS SO WEIRD ABOUT EVERYTHING*   The other kid is named Stella or Star or something. Could be Ruby’s but she looks SO Fae and seems to have been raised in the Fae Realms. I think she might be the product of Sam Hooking Up With A Girl In The Fairy Episode Who Was Definitely A Fae But This Fact Was Never Addressed.   …or she might be Ruby’s after all and just look kinda elf-y.   Or…. No that’s way too weird I don’t wanna think abt it.  Well WHOEVER HER PARENTS ARE Stella is a DAMN good witch and flew under Blurrywife and everyone else’s radar by focusing on plant- and color-based magic - ie all physical components.Afaik nobody even realized she HAD powers til she pulled off a brilliantly designed spell and set her dad free.  Taking advantage of the whole Set The Egyptian Chaos God debacle (aka Blurrywife finally found an entity that she simply has no power over) Ruby snuck into whatever Fae Dreamscape Thing Sam’s soul was trapped in and was able to help Edward Stella (Edward and Stella. Kill me/j. Ruby why) and Sam’s newest girlcrush* A PRIMORDIAL TITANESS get Sam to wake up and dispel the whole dreamscape quietly over the next few days freeing the various Fae and ghosts who had been trapped by Blurrywife as well. One Faerie woman stayed behind to face Blurrywife’s wrath. We don’t know what name she went by outside the dreamscape but as Blurrywife wrote it her name was Cassie.   * Sam is likely just now remembering that Eileen exists now that he’s free. That being said Titan Lady seems very aware of this very chill has never been aggressive with any advances towards Sam afaik she’s literally just nice. Turns out some primordials are just NICE.   Speaking of which Blurrywife is actually starting to take a lot of Ls. I think it’s finally catching up to her how far above her level she’s playing right now. Courting Set’s allegiance was a fiasco and led to her getting embarrassingly dragged around by the Chaos god for a week or so before someone else finally put a stop to it. She’s lost Sam who was really her single huge bargaining chip with all these powerful entities. Due to these humiliations defeats and generally being a dishonorable backstabber Victoria is no longer pleased to be sharing her divinity much less a vessel with The Blurry Bitch so now those two are fighting within themself. Careful Blurrywife… you’re slipping…     In other news there’s some new powerful figures about:   A TERRIFYING woman/goddess of Akkadian or Proto-Semitic origin who seems to be connected to Cain not a fighter but definitely a prophetess who runs at least partially on Angel (meta)Physiology Rules (and I’ll just say it she’s hot).  Serapis who I assumed would be a total douche like most Roman gods but turns out to be fairly grounded and surprisingly young. He doesn’t want to be involved in all this either.   A witch like a 16th-19th century witch. She does all the usual things witches of the time did. She’s very racist. She’s Lucifer’s new consort and set to be an apocalypse prophet. She’s very happy with all this. She’s still deeply religious at heart. …she’s a 16th-19th century witch what more is there to say.      Finally expect updates on CW Gotham Knights- adjacent subjects within the next week. Or possibly just general Bat Man stuff. Or whoever that actor is who plays Turner Hayes in GK. I don’t have any other details there but something’s about to happen.      TLDR: Azazel Metatron London is in ashes Sam’s soul is free Sam’s children now number 3 with the addition of two SamRuby kids of expected/human age and DEEPLY stupid names Blurrywife is losing ground some interesting entities hanging about.,2024-07-10 00:23:16 GMT

Anyways I’m writing off the assumption that reader is also an experienced hunter. If you’d like me to do one where they’re not just lmk.   A - Affection: (How affectionate are they? How do they show affection?)   - Dean struggles with affection. In the deepest parts of his soul he wants to shower you in every ounce of affection that he can. However he’s scared that if he does he’ll overwhelm you or scare you off so instead he shows affection in small special ways.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; B - Best friend: (What would they be like as a best friend? How would the friendship start?)   - Dean is one hoot of a best friend. There’s never a boring moment with him and he is ALWAYS there when you need him even if you don’t ask for his help. Loyal to the end and right by your side through thick and thin.   C - Cuddles: (Do they like to cuddle? How would they cuddle?)   - Dean only cuddles behind closed doors. Somedays he’ll wrap you in his arms and hold you close to his chest. Others he crawls into bed beside you and buries his face in your chest to be held.   D - Domestic: (Do they want to settle down? How are they at cooking and cleaning?)   - Oh how he wishes the two of you could settle down but he knows that you two aren’t cut out for the apple pie life. He’s a fantastic cook and he tries to help clean but somehow the normally skilled and balanced hunter is such a clueless clutz when it comes to cleaning. You once walked in on him trying to figure out how to sweep a dirt pile into a dustpan and you couldn’t help but giggle as he repeatedly dropped the broom before finally giving up and using his hand to sweep the dirt into the pan.   E - Ending: (If they had to break up with their partner how would they do it?)   - Dean would never even consider breaking up with you. You’re his everything. The only way the two of you are parting ways is if you make that move. If you do decide to break up with him he does his best to understand and let you go but damn it hurts him so much. He always wants what is best for you and if he thinks you don’t think he’s best for you then so be it.   F - Fiancé(e): (How do they feel about commitment? How quick would they want to get married?)   - Dean has always thought that if given the chance to make you his wife he’d take it. However he’s not going to make the first move and if the two of you head in that direction then he’s going to make sure you have everything you ever dreamed of for your engagement and wedding.   G - Gentle: (How gentle are they both physically and emotionally?)   - As for day-to-day interactions with Dean he’s always gentle. Physically he holds you carefully and touches you softly. Emotionally he chooses his words carefully and always listens intently. However that being said if you ever willingly or unwillingly out yourself in harm’s way his words get loud and blunt. He never hurts you physically but he does yell out every bit of his frustration. Once he’s gotten it off his chest he always apologizes for raising his voice at you and the two of you calmly talk it out   H - Hugs: (Do they like hugs? How often do they do it? What are their hugs like?)   - Dean LOVES hugs but he doesn’t always ask for them. Over the years you learn how to tell when he needs a good hug. He will always give you a hug before the two of you part ways with a kiss on your forehead. His hugs vary. If he’s hugging you it’s a warm firm and solid hug where all you can see hear or smell is him. If you’re hugging him without him asking he’ll sling his arms loosely around your waist and bury his face in your chest or neck. It’s more of a gentle and relaxed hug.   I - I love you: (How fast do they say the L-word?)   - The first time Dean said the L-word was because you got hurt protecting him on a hunt. As soon as the threat was eliminated and the car door shut he went off. He insisted you never pull a stunt like that again and said he couldn’t stand the thought of you getting hurt because of him among other things. When he finally got it all out of his system he dropped his head into his hands and mumbled under his breath. You asked him to repeat what he mumbled and he looked up to look you dead in the eyes to say “I love you damn it.&quot;   J - Jealousy: (How jealous do they get? What do they do when they’re jealous?)   - Dean hides his jealousy with cockiness. When he gets jealous he struts up to wrap his arms securely around your waist and bury his face in your neck. He’ll give the person a good &quot;nice try” look and stand his ground not letting you go for a second.   K - Kisses: (What are their kisses like? Where do they like to kiss you? Where do they like to be kissed?)   - After time apart they’re intense. Teeth clashing and holding onto you for dear life. Your average every day kisses are gentler and purposeful. His favorite place to kiss you is your forehead.   - Every time the two of you part ways he kisses your forehead. Sometimes when you’re just sitting there minding your own business reading research or whatever he quickly places a kiss on your forehead and ruffles your hair. Even when he gets up to go to the bathroom he plants a sweet kiss to your hairline.   - He loves when you kiss his boo boos and make them better. He can’t understand or explain it but butterflies erupt in his stomach and face gets warm when you press a gentle kiss to an injury you just got done cleaning and bandaging.   L - Little ones: (How are they around children?)   - Dean is good at entertaining babies but not so great at taking care of them. Hand him a baby with a diaper full and he’s gonna stare it with his nose scrunched up unsure of where to even start but if you task him with watching a baby he’s gently bouncing it around or handing it toys to inspect or playing peek a boo like a pro. As for older kids it’s the opposite. He raised Sammy for crying out loud. He knows how to take care of a kid that can walk and talk but for the life him can’t figure out how to keep them entertained or have a conversation with them.   M - Morning: (How are mornings spent with them?)   - Rarely Dean is up and at ‘em before you. You find it hard to escape his iron clad grasp upon waking up yourself. Sometimes you lay there admiring the features of his face and sometimes you fall back asleep but you never leave the bed before he does.   N - Night: (How are nights spent with them?)   - Dean always crawls into bed first arms open and awaiting your presence. Sometimes the two of you will lay there awake just talking about anything and everything. Sometimes you crash hard and fast and he’s left admiring you as you sleep. Rarely you get to admire him as he drifts off to dream land.   O - Open: (When would they start revealing things about themselves? Do they say everything all at once or wait a while to reveal things slowly?)   - It took Dean quite a while to reveal his inner workings to you. In fact he didn’t say anything at all at first simply showed you. He took the mask off with you for short bursts of time slowly working up to not wearing the mask at all with you. There were a few times when he fully vented or explained things to you but for the most part he simply showed you.   P - Patience: (How easily angered are they?)   - He’s always patient with you. Even when you made Baby stall as he tried to teach you how to drive stick shift he kept his calm. He’s not usually quick to anger with other people unless they’re having a negative impact on your well-being.   Q - Quizzes: (How much would they remember about you? Do they remember every little detail you mention in passing or do they kind of forget everything?)   - Every. Little. Detail. If there was a trivia game show about you he’d take first place easily even if you were also playing. Sometimes he remembers something you said when you don’t even remember saying it.   R - Remember: (What is their favorite moment in your relationship?)   - He’ll never forget the night you dragged him and Sammy both to their separate bedrooms because the two were locked in on researching some end of the world bullshit. Your giggles at their “ow ow ow”-ing were adorable and the fact that you told them both that if they didn’t get some sleep you were going to kick them in their “baby makers” just made him realize how much you care about them both. Sammy even tried to sneak past your’s and Dean’s room but you got up out of bed and dragged him back to his own.   S - Security: (How protective are they? How would they protect you? How would they like to be protected?)   - Hella protective of you. He’s your secret service. He’s your knight in shining armor. He knows you can take care of yourself but why should you have to when he can do it? He always puts himself between you and danger.   - He doesn’t like the idea of you putting yourself in danger to protect him. However he also knows you’re going to do it anyway but that doesn’t mean he won’t give you an earful for it later. On the other hand sometimes Dean crawls into your lap and buries into your chest just to shut the world out. That’s when he feels most protected.   T - Try: (How much effort would they put into dates anniversaries gifts everyday tasks?)   - Mans puts more effort into celebrating you and making sure you’re happy than he does anything else ever. In fact the first birthday you had while the two of you were dating threw you off guard. You had completely forgotten it was your birthday having adapted to it just being another normal day. Dean remembered. He stopped at a random grocery store on y&#x27;all’s way home from a hunt and when he came out carrying a cake and your favorite snacks you were beyond confused. He hopped in the car and handed everything to you and written across the top of the cake was “Happy Birthday (Y/N)!” He was bewildered that you were bewildered but he made sure you never forgot your birthday again.   U - Ugly: (What would be some bad habits of theirs?)   - He doubts himself far too often. He knows he’s a good hunter there’s no doubting that. However he doubts his ability to keep you safe. He doubts his ability to make you happy. He gets in this headspace where all he can think about is there being someone out there that is way better for you than him and all his baggage. You’ve figured out how to tell when he’s doing this and always reassure him endlessly that he’s all you want and more.   V - Vanity: (How concerned are they with their looks?)   - He knows he’s all that and a bag of chips when it comes to looks but he’s not obsessed with himself or making sure he looks good. He doesn’t have time to spend staring in the mirror to make sure he looks his best. He showers shaves brushes his hair and teeth but that’s about it.   W - Whole: (Would they feel incomplete without you?)   - Dean feels like he can’t breathe when you’re away from him. You help him keep his head on straight and make him feel important. Without you he tends to spiral into a mess.   X - Xtra: (A random headcanon for them.)   - Dean keeps a mental list of all your favorite songs. Even if you don’t specifically say it is he knows by the way you sing it at the top of your lungs or bounce around in excitement when it comes on.   - I don’t think this is canon but I also haven’t ever paid enough attention to it in the several times I’ve watched the show. However it seems fitting for Dean. I think he refuses to sit with his back to the entrance(s) of a room. He keeps all windows in his line of sight as well. (I may or may not be projecting bc I also do this).   Y - Yuck: (What are some things they wouldn’t like either in general or in a partner?)   - Mans HATES sexist douchebags. He makes sure that every hunter he meets knows that you once took down an entire vamp nest by yourself. The civilians are quickly made aware that you run the show and they better not disrespect you.   Z - Zzz: (What is a sleep habit of theirs?)   - Dean always sleep on the side of the bed closest to the door. It doesn’t matter if you guys are in the bunker or some sketchy motel room. If he wakes up in the middle of the night and you have somehow rolled over to that side he gently rolls you back over to safety. Also he almost always ends up sprawled out across the bed usually at least partially on top of you if not fully covering you.   More Dean Winchester  Masterlist,2024-07-10 02:45:00 GMT

The Deity of Chaos  Note:This will be a long story and he’s not an actual deity. It was a title given to him out of fear.     In the year 2002 a child named Gabriel was conceived. Days after he was born Gabriel started displaying latent abilities by making the plants in his parents house die when he was around them. At the age of 8 after chasing a dream of becoming a super saiyan he coincidentally started practicing energy manipulation. Specifically moving it around his entire body shaping it the way he saw fit. By age 15 Gabriel received a book (Grimoire) that contained spells and rituals to become a shifter. With it came a note that said “You will be the gods greatest gift”. He later performed a ritual to become a werewolf. Initially nothing happened until a few years later when his dark matter levels went through the roof. One night while he was fixing himself some food a horrible pain caught him off guard and he fell to the ground. He started to shift. After the transformation was complete he ran out of the house and into the woods near his home. Unfortunately for a young woman he mangled her body until it was unrecognizable. Taking her arm and over half of her skin. When he finally found out what he and the spirit had done Gabriel wasn’t afraid of what he became but relished in the fact that he knows what he’s capable of and he finally knew what he was….a monster.

6,Supernatural,['dean winchester'  'dean winchester is not bi'  'spn had queer rep'],sammywinchesterisalesbian,Dean Winchester is a straight man with a creepy interest in teenage girls and asian women. He is not bisexual in fact he is canonically homophobic. I think that perhaps Bi Dean truthers need to rewatch SPN.   Also I think I’ve said this before but stop calling people who don’t ship D*stiel homophobic just because you’re a weirdo and want to watch a hot man get fucked in the ass. Castiel’s “love confession” at the end of the show was fan service at most and he’s not gay he showed a lot of interest in women throughout the show. There were two recurring gay characters and demons who made out with everyone. You guys are like “oh we want queer rep” but conveniently forget the second that the queer rep is a nerdy lesbian who isn’t particularly masc- or femme leaning or a black twink. I’m not saying that it was particularly well done queer rep- they killed both Charlie and Max after not giving either character much screen time- but it was rep.   Just admit that the queer rep you actually want is just gay porn and stop bullying people on the internet.   This post is directed at the adult women in the fandom who are very weird about D*stiel and gay men in general. It is directed at women who only read mlm but are grossed out at wlw literature.

6,Supernatural,['dean winchester'  'dean winchester is not bi'  'spn had queer rep'],sammywinchesterisalesbian,Dean Winchester is a straight man with a creepy interest in teenage girls and asian women. He is not bisexual in fact he is canonically homophobic. I think that perhaps Bi Dean truthers need to rewatch SPN.   Also I think I’ve said this before but stop calling people who don’t ship D*stiel homophobic just because you’re a weirdo and want to watch a hot man get fucked in the ass. Castiel’s “love confession” at the end of the show was fan service at most and he’s not gay he showed a lot of interest in women throughout the show. There were two recurring gay characters and demons who made out with everyone. You guys are like “oh we want queer rep” but conveniently forget the second that the queer rep is a nerdy lesbian who isn’t particularly masc- or femme leaning or a black twink. I’m not saying that it was particularly well done queer rep- they killed both Charlie and Max after not giving either character much screen time- but it was rep.   Just admit that the queer rep you actually want is just gay porn and stop bullying people on the internet.   This post is directed at the adult women in the fandom who are very weird about D*stiel and gay men in general. It is directed at women who only read mlm but are grossed out at wlw literature. I do not respect you and I think that perhaps you need to work on understanding your biases.,2024-07-10 07:11:25 GMT

How could you possibly guess that ?”  “You have the look. It’s awful. Arguably worse than fighting a potential future evil version of yourself.”  Dean thinks about that. He compares this experience to the demon him from the dreamroot thing. “…yeah this was definitely weirder.”  Danny shrugs.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; “So… how did you end up in a time travel adventure last night? I think if the Trickster came back we’d see some more signs.” Sam asks.  “Castiel dropped in confirmed the apocalypse stuff.”  “Then dropped you back in time?”  “Yeah… apparently Mom made a demon deal for Dad’s life. It’s why…” Dean stopped himself he barely knew Danny what was he thinking!   “I know?” Danny offers looking between Sam and him.  “Right…” Dean continues. He doesn’t think Danny will go all Gordon Walker on them but if he had all the details… Dean isn’t giving all the details. “Castiel also said it was Lillith who broke the seal.&quot;   &quot;He’s sure?” Sam asks at the same time Danny asks  “Lilith is a demon right?”  “Yeah she’s a demon and I don’t think Castiel would tell us if he wasn’t sure.”  “Any problem if I kill her?” Danny asks. And the quick reaction makes Dean glad he didn’t elaborate on Sammy’s thing.  “We’ve been trying.” Sam tells him. “If you get the chance please.”  Danny gives a thumbs up. And Dean feels sorry that he has to drop the mood even further. “They’re trying to release Lucifer.”  “What’s a Lucifer?”  “Ha ha.” Dean says it would probably be funny if they had any plan for beating ‘a Lucifer’. But Danny… he doesn’t look like he’s joking. Then Sammy’s phone goes off and he leaves Dean to deal with this conversation himself. Traitor.  “Lucifer like The Devil Lucifer.”  “Oh a name got it! You have beef with this guy or something? ”  “He’s going to try to end the world.”  “Think he’ll be better or worse at it than The Pariah?”  “Who’s the Pariah?”  “… guy who yoinked a small town off the face of the earth for a week? Has a skeleton army?”  “What?! Kid are you sure you’re not talking about a cartoon or something?!”  “It’d be hard to forget was around the time Vortex did his thing. Actually a lot of stuff happened then that year was wild.”  “Lucifer will have an army of Demons.” Dean said because if he didn’t stay focused he was going to end up following Danny’s rabbit trails till the world ended.  “Yeah that’s not ideal. Freeing a lot of possessed people is a lot harder than wack-a-mole skeleton edition.”  “I’m not going to ask.” Sam returns to the table. He probably came to the same conclusion about Danny’s stories a few months ago. “That was Travis he wants us to look into something.”  “Now?” Danny asks.  “Yeah there’s this guy Jack Montgomery has something going on with him.”  “Okay 1 problem.” Danny continues.  “What kind of problem?”  “Oh not a problem for you Dean. But I have a sister who has this friend see. And she spent all of yesterday warding off marked spirits and he hasn’t called her back after playing phone tag all day.  Sam swore. Fumbling to get his phone back out of his pocket. His brother had been a mess yesterday. He’d leave a voicemail but be in a situation while she called back. He’d gotten a voicemail after the witnesses were released he’d left a voice-mail then too. Apparently the loverbirds hadn’t actually spoken yet.  &quot;Oooh Sammy’s in the doghouse huh?”  “Not yet I’m supposed to drag him home first.”  Dean grinned “Do I get to meet the lovely Lady?&quot;   &quot;I think you’ll have too though seriously she’ll understand it if this is time sensitive. Mind if I tag along?”  “Not at all Sammy’s a trouble magnet. He could use all the help he could get.”  —  “Don’t you love when this stuff mean spying on a man in his own home.” Danny deadpans. He’s not using the binoculars holding them like they’re personally offensive.   “There are worse parts of the job.” Dean reminds him Jack Montgomery is rummaging through his fridge. “This guy? I mean this guy’s boring”  “I don’t know Dean. Travis seemed pretty sure.”  “Did he give any indication of what we’re supposed to be— oh.”  Oh was correct. Dean watched Montgomery just abandon the leftovers and start in on a pack of ground beef. Raw ground beef.  “I’d say that qualifies as weird.” Sam notes. Like that needed to be said.  —  “Thanks for helping out an old man. I’m a little uh shorthanded.” Travis lifts his cast covered atm and They laugh politely at the bad joke. Then he gets straight to the point and Dean’s glad they’re done pretending to catch up. It’s awkward with Danny lurking behind them. “You track down Montgomery?”  “Yeah we found him at his home.” Sam tells him.  “And?”  “Well he had a hell of a case of the munchies topped off with a burger he forgot to cook.”  “That’s him alright.”  “What’s him?”  “Boys we got a rougarou on our hands.”  “A rougarou?” Dean looks to Sam for a convenient monster summary(or movie title that would work too.). Sam gives him nothing. “Is that made up? That sounds made up.”  “They’re mean nasty little suckers. Rotted teeth wormy skin the works.” Travis tells them.  “Well that ain’t this guy. I mean he was wearing a cellphone on his belt.”  “He’ll turn ugly soon enough. They start out human for all intents and purposes.”  “So what?” Sam asks “They go through some kind of metamorphosis?”  “Yep like a maggot turning into a bull fly.”  “No need to be cruel.” Danny chides. Travis pauses looks at Danny with an expression thats not quite a sneer. Dean really hopes that’s not gonna become a problem.  “They’re hungry things.” Trevor continues ignoring the kid’s glare. “First for everything until they get a taste for human flesh. Once they get a taste they transform. One bite’s all it takes. Eyes teeth skin; all turns. No going back either. They feed once they’re a monster forever. And our man Jack’s headed there on a bullet train.”  “Well how’d you find this guy if he’s a walking talking human?” Dean demands.  “Lets just say it runs in his family.”  “You mean uh…” Sam trails off.  “Killed his daddy back in &#x27;78. Son of a bitch mangled 8 bodies before I put him down. Guy used to be a dentist. Cadillac trophy wife… Little did I know pregnant trophy wife. She put the boy up for adoption. By the time I found out he was long gone lost in the system.”  The air in the room changes this time in a way that’s familiar. The unspoken threat looms…   “You mean to tell me you couldn’t find someone?” Sam asks undeterred. Sam doesn’t feel it.  Travis sighs. “I’m not sure I wanted to. The idea of hunting down some poor kid… I don’t think I’d have the heart. No. I wanted to wait make damn sure I had the right man. Apparently I do.”  The air itself has teeth and breathing takes effort. Travis doesn’t notice either. He takes a swig of his beer.  —  Travis might not notice that Danny is friggen weird but after the comment earlier he does notice that the kid is incredibly uncomfortable. He singles the kid out to prep the flame throwers not letting him escape with Sam.   Dean took a chance and elbowed the kid in his side hard enough to hurt but not hard enough to bruise. Made a face at him and the kid had quit messing with the room’s… well the room’s vibes .   Travis seemed under the impression that Danny was just new to this life and Dean would prefer to keep it that way.  “So fire huh?” They’d been subjected to a few stories of past hunts and the kid had withdrawn more with each of them. Dean wants to change the subject but can’t find a natural way to do so. Better they stay focused on this.  “The only way I found to kill these bastards; deep-fry &#x27;em.”  “Well that’s gonna be…” He glanced at the kid. “horrible. Is that what you did to Jack’s dad?”  “Uh-huh” Travis starts and Dean realizes he&#x27;s being an idiot. That’s just gonna get a more on topic gruesome story but Sam best baby brother in the world saves them.   He walks through the door with an accusation. “Not wasting any time are you?&quot;   &quot;None to waste.” Travis informs them. “The guy hulks out we won’t be finding bodies just remains.”  Sam sits down next to the table in a controlled movement. He’s forcing himself to act calm. “What if he doesn’t hulk out? I did a little homework. Uh I’ve been checking out the lore on rougarous.”  Danny’s head shoots up. It reminds Dean of caged animal seeing possible freedom.  “What? My 30 years of experience not good enough for you?” Travis demands.  “What? No. No I-I- I just wanted to be prepared. I mean not that you didn’t…”  “Sam loves research. He does. He keeps it under his mattress right next to his KY. It’s a sickness.” He looks over at Sam hiding the rescue with some teasing. “It is.”  “Look everything you said checked out of course but uh. I found a couple of interesting stories about people who have this rougarou gene or whatever. See they start to turn but they never take the final step.”  “Really?”  “See if they never eat human flesh they don’t fully transform.” Well no wonder their monster-adjacent friend is freaked. Maybe he’s something similar hanging onto his humanity with everything he can?   “So what? Go vegan stay human?”  “Basically. Or in this case eat a lot of raw meat just not…”  “Right.”  “Good on you for the due diligence Sam.” Travis gets up to pace the room. Its unnecessarily dramatic. “But those are fairy tales. Fact is every rougarou I ever saw or heard of… took that bite.”  “Okay well that doesn’t mean that Jack will.” Sam stands too.   “So what do we do? Sit and hope and wait for a body count?”  “No we talk to him. Explain what’s happening. That way he can fight it.”  “Fight it?” Travis laughs. “Are you kidding me? You ever been really hungry? I mean haven’t-eaten-in-days hungry?”  “Yeah.” Dean answers Danny nods too.   “Yeah. Right then. So somebody slaps a big juicy sirloin in front of you you walking away?”  “No” Dean mutters because he wouldn’t.  “Depends.” Danny challenges.” You know what happens if you eat that big hearty meal? If you haven’t eaten in days ?”  “Uh no.” Dean was never been allowed to eat what he wants after the few times he’d been starving.   “You get sick.” Sam answers. Ok that was probably explained to him he just remembers being hungry and grouchy about it.   Danny nods “If you haven’t eaten in days and you have the right information you eat something small and light that seems unsatisfying until you’ve gotten it all down. You don’t risk tearing open your stomach lining. And besides! How would you know about rougarou’s who don’t turn?! People aren’t going to announce their fantasies of eating people! They’re could be generations who resist and they’d look just like everyone else!”  “And you don’t know that they’re are.” He looks between the two of them. “I’m sorry. I’m sure he’s a stand-up guy but it’s pure base instinct. Everything in nature’s gotta eat. You think he can stop himself &#x27;cause he’s nice?”  “Coconut milk.” Danny declares and Dean almost laughs. He lets the absurd statement sink in for a moment before he continues. “Coconut milk can be used as a substitute for blood. There are vampires who live off it. They get night jobs and exist exactly like everyone else. You’ve had what twenty years? You’ve just been waiting for this guy to crack did you bother to look? Did you ask why a rougarou might crave human flesh?   “Because when we crave salt or red meat or whatever it’s usually because the body is lacking in the nutrients it needs! This all might get solved by giving him a vitamin supplement!”  “We try to help him.” Sam declares. “And we’re not gonna kill him unless he does something to get killed for.&quot;   —  Danny didn’t make jokes when talking to Jack Montgomery. The seriousness was almost as jarring as the conversation.  See Dean’s plan had gone something like this:   1.)Tell the guy what he is.   2.)Convince him they aren’t insane.  3.)Tell him not to eat people or they’d be back.  Repeat step 2 as needed.  Danny started similarly steps 1 and 2 are the same but step 3…  &quot;You’re not alone. There are people I can put you in contact if you want. They might not be the same species but they’ll have similar experiences. They might have other suggestions that will help.”  Danny has a list of substitutes advice a food journal to track what works better or worse. That conversation leads into another and another of things that might alleviate that hunger. Then how they leave…  “I don’t need to tell you why you shouldn’t eat human flesh. You obviously already know. But I will warn you about the change. &#x27;A taste’ is what the stories say and I don’t know if that means a bite or mearly a drop of blood But if the change happens it cannot be undone.”  And Jack nods solemn. He makes his promise and he thanks them.  —  It’s Mrs. Montgomery who finds them hours later. She finds them by asking the diner’s patrons “Who owns that awful van?!”  And Danny the only one in town with a van that awful raises his hand.   She’s confused and frantic but she knows her husband thought they could help with… it’s unclear what Jack told her whether half truth or blatant lie but now everything has fallen apart.   —  Travis’ car is in the driveway.  They don’t have to break into the house. Even if they hadn’t had the keys the back door is already broken in.   It’s not a surprise when they find a body. It’s a carved up corpse not a charcoaled one.   “What happened?” Danny isn’t asking them.   —  “He’s not a hunter is he?” Dean asks his brother. They watch from a room away as Jack Montgomery and Danny Fenton speak in hushed urgent tones. When Jack had turned into the livingroom Sam had flinched and Dean had curled his lip in disgust. Danny hadn’t reactioned and Jack had noticed. So now Danny was the only one worthy of whatever this conversation was.  “He calls himself an electrician that knows too much.” Sam answers.   “How much do you know about how he works?”  “…enough.”  &quot;Sam… I don’t think he’s human.”  Sam looks at him watches his face as he asks “and if he’s not?”  “I don’t know Sammy. I wouldn’t say he’s hurting anybody.”  “Dean I think there’s some things we need to talk about…”  “What?”  “Not here not now. ” Sam gestured to the bloody mess on the ground and the still blood covered man in the kitchen. “When this is sorted we need to talk about what happened while you were dead.”  —  “He’s going to clean himself up and pack.” Danny tells them. “Then we’re going to pick up his wife see what she wants to do then we’re going. I’ll meet you at Jazz’s.”  “You’re taking him to the Coconut Vampires.” Dean predicted.   “Yeah.” Danny didn’t elaborate further.   “How does that work? What if one of &#x27;em falls off the rails or something?”  “They deal with their own.”  “Right… Sam you still have Lenore’s number?”  “Yeah”  Dean nods to him and steps back out of earshot. Lenore the leader of the Cattle-Blood-Instead-of-Human-Blood Vampires probably needed to be in touch with the Coconut Vampires. Dean never asked Sam where they went didn’t need to know. Dean knew then if he’d known where he’d be compelled to check in person and they didn’t need him poking through all their business. Sam kept track of the missing persons numbers where they stayed and they hadn’t needed to follow up.  He doesn’t have high hopes for Jack not really but those two do and others do. Castiel was right he doesn’t have much faith and the least he can do to avoid spreading his doubt all over the place. Maybe they’ll prove him wrong.  He hopes they prove him wrong.,2024-07-10 12:46:04 GMT

I’ve never actively participated on tumblr before so it was a nice change. The stress I had writing this was unbelievable but as a fanatic I’d take any excuse to write about my favorites     &lt;!-- more --&gt; Bars were always familiar comforting even but this bar was fancier than the ones Y/n grew up with. A very different crowd and a lot cleaner. She could practically see her face on every surface. The view might have been enjoyable had she not been working.  ”If I looked that good I don’t think I’d stop looking either.”  Her eyes shifted to the man’s reflection before finally looking up and locking eyes. She ran her finger around the rim of her glass.  ”Maybe” He clears his throat. “It’s the design. Countertop’s made from granite. Makes it durable won’t scratch easy hard to stain and-“ His eyes search hers nervously. &quot;I’m sorry I just can’t think of an excuse good enough to talk to someone like you.”  “Well I’ll give you an opening then” She smiles leaning forward with her hands intertwined as she jokingly whispers. “I’ve never really been here before so I only picked what I know. You could help recommend a drink.”  Immediately he nodded to the bartender hoisting his glass. “Get her what I’m having will you?” He smiles at her. “You’ll love it.”  &quot;I usually just drink Craig&quot;   They turned to the new voice. The accent noticeable rolling off the tongue smoothly nice black suit. His entirety demanded attention. &quot;The old stuff is really the only drink worth taking. 30 years aged at least if you want perfection.”  “Your opinion I’m sure. My recommendation is more than pleasant for a first drink.”  “Yes well you also thought going after a woman with that wedding ring imprint still present was a good idea.” He smiles at his drink amused before looking at Y/n. “I’d be hesitant to approach him for that if I was you love. Clearly just took it off for the night hoping someone like yourself would come along.“  Y/n gaps at the stranger’s uncalled outing. The married man too embarrassed to come up with a defense decided to stumble away. She didn’t make an effort to call after him she couldn’t afford to. A whole month’s worth of tracking and taking behavioral notes all flushed down the drain just like that. The only thing working as planned was the free drink the bartender barely managed to place in front of her. Improvising wasn’t a foreign concept but nonetheless she was willing. &quot;Thanks for that.” She started softly glancing at him.  “No worries.“ He dismissed. &quot;Doubt he would have made good company anyway.”  “I guess it’s just bad luck on my part.” Resting her chin on her palm she looked around before settling her eyes back to her drink.   “Perhaps.” He looks at her smiling. “Nonetheless if I’m not pushing luck of my own I was wondering if I can buy you another round?”  It surprised her a rather bold move scaring a man away only to move in himself. At least she was subtle about it. Then again him showing interest first helps. She smiles knitting her brows slightly. She admits the other man although shady had a good taste. She liked the evenness of the bittersweet taste on her tongue. “Thank you but I just got this drink.”  “I mean the next one is on me. If you’re willing to stick around after that mishap. Besides I’d be more at ease if you did it’s not really safe to drink alone. Unless of course” His brows went up as she naturally crossed her legs taking the bait. His eyes trailed from her heels to her eyes slowly. “You’re one of those women who can hold her own?”  “Is that such a bad thing?” She laughs lightly.  “It’s dangerous” His grin widens as he hears her laugh. “A girl better said a girl as pretty as you not afraid of getting herself in trouble? It’s a recipe for disaster.”  “What’s the point of living if you have to be afraid all the time? Looking over your shoulder like that?”  ”Hardly a life at all.” He agrees.  “Are you gonna give me a name or are you just a passing stranger giving advice?” Y/n scoffs a smile. She needed a false sense of trust a name could be just as powerful as anything. How you use it. How you say it.  “Crowley” he answered bluntly. “May I know yours?”  ”Y/n” she gives her hand despite the late introduction.  ”Y/n” He repeats taking her hand in his in a more gentlemanly manner bringing it up to his lips for a light kiss on her knuckles never breaking his gaze. “Seems like a perfect fit.” He grins.  There was a small tightness in her stomach. She found herself forgetting her job for a second. When was the last time she actually enjoyed a guy rather than screwing him over for his money?  “Thank you Mr.Crowley.” Then again she was barely grazing the top with this guy.  “You’re very welcome.” Dark eyes such a deep brown looking back into hers. He admired the flush on her cheeks though there was a chance it could have been from her drink he was far too confident to believe it.  ”Tell me” Crowley kept her hand in his. “Why is a beautiful young woman like yourself spending time in a place like this?”  “If you got a better place in mind I’m all ears” she shrugs smiling. This was exactly what she needed for a quick win. An invitation.  He laughs to himself a small shake of the head. “I wouldn’t exactly recommend an evening with me.”  She smirked into her drink making sure he saw her size him up before taking an aim at his ego. “Don’t tell me no good?” She taunts playfully.  He chuckled amused. “Too good for you to handle. In fact I assure you you’ll try to come back to me afterward and I don’t want to deal with that kind of nagging. I have a job to do after all. The drink was merely to show my sympathies for such a misfortune. You spend the night with me and well” his knuckles grazed her leg. “I’d ruin you for other men.”  He smirks at the idea. “A place does come to mind but it’s a bit more….private” he whispered lowly in his throat.  ”Really?” She hums amused.   He nods. “No crowds nothing loud or obnoxious just the two of us with a few drinks talking like civilized people.”  “Sounds like a good time”  “It does doesn’t it?” He stands from his seat bringing her with him linking her arm with his. She tilts her head. He was charming she’d give him that much. She almost found it entertaining. &quot;It’s a little ways from here I hope that isn’t an issue?”  ”By all means lead the way.”  They reached the exit. The valet nodded to them as a slightly stretched car pulled up. The driver in front got off to help open the door but Crowley was closer stopping the man. He opens it letting her in first. The inside was just as lovely. Dark brown leather seats and a side bar with several drinks and glasses to match. Once he got in with her she gestured to the bottle.  &quot;Scotch?” She voiced her thoughts remembering he mentioned it.  “Scotch Craig old stuff. One of the only things I’d let near my lips” Crowley says pouring her a drink. He examined his own crystal before letting his hand rest with it on his knee smirking. “Amongst other things.”  She gives an airy laugh. Her lipstick stained the glass at contact. Crowley watches her in silence before clearing his throat. “Y’know I can’t help but wonder are you just looking for good company or just a few good drinks to get you through the night?”  “I’m entitled to enjoy myself after a week of work aren’t I? Besides I’m a firm believer in letting faith take its course. If the right company did come along with it why not have both?”  He hums in response. “Well that got you near a married man tonight.”  “But you interfered” Y/n reminds him. ‘And the bastard didn’t have the balls to stand his ground.’ A simple comment to suggest he should mind his business was all that she was asking for to continue.  “And now you’re here.” He chuckled. “Tell me are you in the right direction then?”  ‘Far from it.’ She couldn’t help but mentally sneer. Instead she smiles at him. Watching his hand slide up to her knee. Placing her own drink on her holder she pushed him into the seat gently before he could go further. Moves onto his lap as she takes the opening she was presented with. Crowley was only teasing he didn’t really expect her to respond so forward. Though he wasn’t going to stop her. His hand moved to support the small of her back.  “Crowley” She trails her fingers down the lining of his jacket. “You’re a businessmen aren’t you?”  “I am” He hums taking a drink of his Scotch. “But what does that have to do with this?”  “Just curious” She says softly. “What kind of business?”  His eyes roam her figure. She was trying to find the benefit of being with him. “I…import and export goods so to speak.” He manages enough to not overshare.  “Meaning?” She tries to dig.  “Meaning I get a lot of stuff from point A” His hand moved from her back caressing her rear to her thigh before pushing his hand up again to shift the edge of her dress higher nearing the edge of her stockings. “And send them out to point B.” He smirks tilting his head at her. “What’s the matter darling? Don’t I not look the part?”  “I was just trying to make conversation” His eyes watched her curiously when she undid his tie using it to pull him closer for a kiss at the corner of his lips. “Is that such a crime?”  He glanced at her lips meeting her halfway as she took him for a proper kiss. Her fingers slowly overlap his when she takes his glass and sets it aside to one of the cup holders. She presses into him not breaking the kiss as she uses the clink of the ice to cover the sound of the sleeping pills going in. She goes down to his neck blocking his view of his drink. Crowley tilts his head back willingly eyes closed as he enjoys the feeling. His hands held her thighs a light squeeze. His fingers eventually find a garter. His brow knits briefly as he smirks.  Finding a garter in this day and age was rare mostly just for show rather than its actual function. Any man with a working brain would know it was a way to show off her intentions. He couldn’t help but wonder if she knew that. He laughs to himself. Slipping his thumb under the band pulling it before letting it go. A small yelp at the sudden snap escaped her lips. Almost sounded like a moan. He couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride being able to get her worked up.  She encourages his hands to roam to drink to grope anything that’ll keep him from noticing the lack of lip contact. As they stumbled into the hotel laughing at every little thing. She groans when he pressed her against the wall of the elevator. Then again as they fumble into the room he passed out almost the second his body hit the bed.   Dropping the act immediately Y/n took a minute to regain her breath before looking around. A low whistle as she noticed the peculiarity of the fancy room. Though nowadays she’s not exactly roughing it as she did when she was a hunter the luxury of it all still left her in awe. It was neat with no signs of luggage. Not even in the closets and provided safe- which she made sure to double-check.  She made her way back to Crowley. Watching his slight stirs as she went through his pockets. The only thing particularly inviting was the wallet. She relocated the cash into her purse before writing the numbers from his plastics on one of the notepads the hotel provides. She ripped it then folded it into her own little notebook. She went to the bathroom to tidy up her appearance.  It did strike her as odd. Having a room but no actual belongings. Not even a small bag yet he was in a nice suit. Nothing like the ones her father used to get on a whim for a hunt. Was it just a one-day meeting thing? Even if he just needed to spend the night how far would his actual place be if he was sure he didn’t need anything come morning? Why book a hotel room at all?  She pulled out a cigarette from her notebook where the pen usually should be. She curses after realizing she has no matches going back into the bedroom for her purse only to stop at the sight of the man sitting contently against the bed frame. “What’s the matter darling?” He looked up from the purse he held in hand. “Need a light?”  ’Shit.’ Two pills were supposed to be enough for him to last till morning when she was long gone.  “I’m a fan of your work. Kind of primitive for a hunter’s daughter wouldn’t you say?”  Her jaw tightened at his casual remark. The situation was a lot more complicated than she thought.  “Then again most hunters are primitive. I admit seeing your work up close and personal” He shook his head with a light laugh. “What a show. Don’t think Daddy would be so pleased if he heard what you were up to these days.”  “What are you.” She questioned immediately.  “You know in the pit of that hunter’s gut of yours exactly what I am.”  “Export and import business huh?” She scoffs. Y/n looks him over. A more sour attitude than when they first met. She didn’t have much room to fight. Her holy water and salt were stashed in her purse which troubling enough was out of reach. There wasn’t a real proper way to deal with demons exactly. At least from the basics she’s learned growing up.  The whole point of leaving that life was to not feel so tense all the time. And now she was in the presence of a creature who could get rid of her so easily. Yet she couldn’t help but continue talking. “Do you have any idea how much work I actually put into these kinds of things? Weeks. I only went for you because you scared off my guy!”  “Ouch.” Crowley chuckles.  “What do you want?”  “That my dear is the million-dollar question isn’t it?” He leaned his back against the bed frame. Crossing his legs as he looks at her thoughtfully. “I have a proposal.”  “A proposal?” What the hell did she have or did he think she had for him to come looking for her?  Did her dad do something?  “As a crossroads demon-”  “A crossroads demon?” She scoffs a laugh. It wasn’t that she’d considered them any less dangerous than a regular demon but they did like to talk a lot more. Almost exactly like a salesman you want out of your house. Then again she’s never heard of one appearing anywhere aside from an actual crossroad. “I admit I’ve done a few stupid things before but I’ve never actually been that stupid.”  ”There’s a first for everything darling.” He smirks. “Course I’m not here for that kind of arrangement what I want is more of a partnership of sorts. See in my line of business its traditions are” he shrugged as he looked around the room. “For a lack of better words outdated. The world is always changing so why don’t we change with it? Brings efficiency sales go up everyone’s happy.”  ”Except for the poor bastards in the deal.” Y/n scoffs.  He immediately waged his finger to correct her. ”Willingly with consent. We just lay out the deal and our terms it’s not our fault if they don’t read the fine print. I assure you nine times out of ten it’s of their own free will and most likely done some level of idiocy to deserve such a faith.”  ”Loopholes” she rolled her eyes. “You know the tricky little things you can get away with because of your charming talks with the desperate.”  ”Point is There are faster better ways to go about it. That’s where you come in love.” He smirks.  “Not much I can do with a soul y’know at least with what I do I get enough money to keep me stable.”  ”Is that what you want? Stability? Or actual comfort? It’s a very simple concept darling. Course I could charm a poor bastard to do my bidding but I think it would be much more beneficial not to mention entertaining to have someone already skilled in manipulating people to do the work for me.” Crowley smiles at the thought. “I find myself enamored with your little scheme conning men. You’re quick on your feet and from what I’ve seen ways before our official meeting know exactly how to pull on a man’s heartstrings. Willam Evans comes to mind poor bastard ready to pull a ring”  ”Why do you think I left?” She huffs amused. “The long way is fun I get showered with gifts and attention but I’d need to do more than just talk. Something I’m not really willing to do unless I find the guy up to my standards. Staying like that too long makes an ‘attachment’ on his end not to mention makes my face more recognizable. The last thing I need on my ass asides from monsters and hunters- is a man trying to give me a ring.”  “Nonetheless there’s no doubt in your potential. You can go from conning a few well-off men to more important Powerful pursuits men of great influence. With a bit more time and practice of course to perfect such an art. And if you’re good enough- powerful women.”  ”So I should be flattered knowing you think I can play both sides?” She couldn’t help but laugh amused at his suggestions. “Demons are sinful lustful creatures”  ”We all have addictions that make the afterlife more entertaining.” He agrees easily. “ Either way I can’t deny that I’m confident a bat of those eyes is enough to put them in your hand latching on to any suggestions just to hear your voice. A siren dragging a sailor to a bottomless sea is you will.”  “I want you to continue doing what you do best under my name of course and in turn I give you your own pay and desires to live as you please. Money power” His eyes easily drifted down her body once again. “Pleasure”  “Yeah!” She laughs “The pleasure to not deal with things like you. I got out for a reason y’know.”  ”The hunter’s dream after a long tortuous battle right? And anyone in such business with a right mind would know you’re never truly out. I would think someone like you wouldn’t be blind to that assessment yes?”  Y/n decided she hated the man on the bed Crowley. What a name. No doubt it was bound to be engraved into her after tonight. She was right from the start he did demand attention. She wondered how long he’d been watching her stalking her. Did he switch between bodies? At some point she should’ve noticed the smell of sulfur right? Or was she really out of touch with her training?  She needed a drink.  “Protection.”  ”Protection?” He knits his brows. “From what exactly?”  “From what? From everything that goes bump in the night. Even things like you”  It was a good request but it was definitely too tall of an offer. For some creatures sure but there were plenty above him. Lilith his boss came to mind immediately. She didn’t even know he was attempting a deal like this no one did. All he could bring himself to do was laugh a little.  Y/n smiled as she watched him. “You can’t do it can you?“  “You have no idea what you’re asking of me.”  ”You said anything I want”  ”Anything within reason darling.” He corrects her. “I can’t give you something that is so far from my control.”  ”Shame.” She sighs before smiling. “Then I guess there’s not much to talk huh?” She gets up from her seat going to the door with her little notebook in hand. “Keep the purse if you want don’t really need it.” It would be a pain to have everything replaced but really her notebook is all she needed.  “You can’t just leave-“ He looked at her in disbelief finding himself moving quickly off the bed to follow her. He hated the feeling of not having the upper hand. It was another reason he’d need to climb ranks but now to think he had to play nice for a hunter? “You’re willing to throw away such a generous offer? Money and anything your heart desires in exchange for a bit of your time and effort? You can’t be bothered to be content with such things?”  Crowley closed the door the second she tried to open it. It was clear that he was frustrated though at the moment actually hurting her wasn’t on his mind. If anything he hated the fact that she could feel that too.  ”What was it you said earlier? Something about not settling for stability? I don’t know if I’m being honest I tuned out a good chunk of your little speech. Y’know focused on that accent of yours- highly distractive by the way”  ”You should understand that I’m simply looking for the best possible interests for both of us in this deal.”  “I agree but accepting a deal like that is like someone offering me a job that I gotta dedicate my whole life to with the idea of a promised bonus or promotion. No guarantee just a promise that can be broken or changed at any moment. You’d think a hunter like me would know better than to take a deal like that.” She opens the door keeping her eyes on him as she goes out.  ”Ex-Hunter I hear” Crowley huffs the second he’s alone.           It was difficult being as talented and charming as Crowley and still having to deal with something as ridiculous as a rejection. Clearly the deal needed some time to play out in her head. Another thing that was frustrating was sharing his views. Demons were practically born with a defiant streak so chances of getting one a decent one to listen were low.  ”Right so this Y/n” Isaac starts slowly as they walk down the park’s sidewalk. “L/n I know a hunter with that don’t I? Name’s familiar.”  ”Daddy dearest yes” Crowley hums.  ”Ah” he nods. He didn’t know he had a daughter or kids in general. It was an interesting turn of events for a solo hunter. It was common for hunters to raise their kids in this life on the off chance that they do live long enough to produce. “You’re right I do think this is ridiculous. C’mon Crowley? A hunter?”   ”Ex-hunter” he corrects. &quot;Now a con artist. Interesting switch in careers if you ask me.”  ”Still you bring her to the party and everyone will be falling over themselves to rip out a piece” Issac shakes his head with a smile. “Hell Lilith herself might take action and keep her as a plaything maybe even eat her literally”  ”I just need a while to prove this is efficient. I swear it’s a crime to be creative. You’d think Hell of all places would encourage unnatural changes.“  ”Right. Except it’s also full of demons who take pleasure in torture especially a lone hunter-”  “Ex-hunter” Crowley corrects again.  “Even on the off chance that it actually works and no one bothers her who’s to say she won’t turn on you? Please tell me you at least-“  &quot;Under contract of course I’m not an idiot.” Crowley looks around. The park was a lovely place for a walk completely quiet and abandoned the second the sun got low. The lamplights guiding their way.  “No of course I’m sure you offered something tempting. Money? A dead relative?” Issac scoff lightly. Remembering the deals he’s made with humans before. All so completely obsessed and desperate. It was sad to watch but the power he felt over them was addictive.  ”Not entirely I mean I did but she…..wants an immunity of sorts from monsters a peaceful life. All she has to do is sway people to me.”  &quot;Immunity huh” Issac smiled amused at the idea. &quot;A hunter with no morals?”  “No” Crowley sighs looking at the sky for a moment the frustration visible in his tone. “They’re very much there. She just wants the proper motivation for the betrayal to at least be worth the effort. I doubt any hunter would blame her for such a deal if immunity was in the cards. Hate her sure but not blame.”  ”So not only do you not have proof of this idea of yours working the girl isn’t even on your side yet?” Issac laughs. “Ain’t that a tall order nice little dame you gotta butter up first-“  ”She’s perfect” he insisted. “You should’ve seen her work up close her manipulation tactics. Just enough to draw you in and make it seem like it’s your idea. I can’t remember the last time a woman got me worked up so quickly”  ”Pretty is she?” Issac loved the idea the older L/n had been a pain in his side for a good while. Bothering his work trying to save his clients. The idea of a daughter just…  ”The amount of men that have fallen for her schemes you’d think she was one of us. Tempting little thing”  “Or just pretty enough lust is rather powerful y’know for someone to just flaunt it.” He shrugs. Lust could so easily pair with other sins sins that build easily in the human mind. Since the first downfall it’s what built everything they know today. Sure none of them knew they’d be basically stuck in a job for eternity fighting for scraps and acknowledgment the whole ordeal was…..well hell.  Crowley was a tad more ambitious than most though it was unclear if it was because of the useless life he lived before or the enjoyment that came with the power of his status. Higher status more power. Promotions and whatnot like any other business. Issac’s been around a fair amount of years he was younger than him managed to make a higher rank. This business was no different than that when he was alive. To think someone wanted to climb so high so easily- it bothered him that he didn’t think of the idea himself but why her?  ”Why are you telling me all this anyway? You have a plan seems like you’re dead set that it would work. Clearly something you can take on your own no?”  “I just wanted your opinion on the matter believe it or not I value your input Issac. Besides” Crowley sighs looking around the park before looking back at him. “I’m not stupid enough to believe I can do this alone. Even demons have their limits.” Honestly he got excited and needed someone to dump his thoughts. Enough to hear his idea out loud.  ”Well you said your fish ain’t on a hook yet right? Got an idea for a next approach?”  “As fun as the push and pull has been I thought it was about time I pushed boundaries. Mold her into the perfect ideal temptation for any idiot within a mile away from her. She wants freedom I’ll promise freedom.”  ”And Lilith? Your position? Any human would get reckless the second they know they can’t get hurt.”  ”I’ll figure something out what I do know is that I need to get her attention first.”  “She’s a con artist right? Not to mention a woman if I were you I’d get her something shiny.”  “Something shiny?” Crowley chuckles at the simplicity of the idea. “Something simple to match the idea then? A Dimond necklace perhaps? Silver setting elegant but not too much to catch attention. If that fails I’d have to look into other options.”  “Mock all you want Crowley but temptation is temptation. You’re trying to get her to look over her nature as a hunter ignore her morals for people’s lives.” He took out his cigarette lighting it. A few puffs before he continued. “Immunity from monsters is a blessing. More so if you manage to convince Lilith but still the necklace is just a showing. Not only can you give her freedom but keep the comfort you offered the first time around.”  &quot;It’s all about presentation” Crowley nods in understanding. “The necklace is a mere taste of the power and influence I hold. Let her know there are luxurious awaiting She’ll have it made if she works for me.”  “At least then she wouldn’t have to take up side jobs that would take her from your intended goal right?” Issac shook his head as he took another drag. Processing the idea to get to Crowley’s understanding of things. “A human workin’ for a demon.“           Of Course considering the last encounter she chose a location far from the last. There were an abundance of ways to play the game. If anything she’d rather her target approach her instead. Then again it depended on the kind of person they were and who she had to be to get them to notice her the way she wanted to be noticed.  So she sat there this time playing the part of the stood-up date. Probably in his 20s but absolutely loaded with Dad’s credit card with how loosely she’s seen him spend it all day. Leading her to sit in a high-end restaurant this time instead of a bar. She’d send a few small glances at him before taking her time to pretend she was looking for someone. It was going well enough at least well enough for him to turn his full body toward her direction as he subtly talked to his companions.  Unfortunately her luck didn’t last enough the man turned around suddenly with a weird look on his face. At the same time she felt a shift in her booth’s seat.  ”Is this seat taken?”  She took a breath not wanting to cause a scene she smiled looking him over briefly. &quot;What are you doing here?”  “I saw a lovely lady sitting alone pouting and my heart couldn’t take it so I decided to come by and keep her company.” He intertwined his fingers. “And well here I am.”  “I’m working” She huffs lightly.  “Working?” Crowley chuckles. “Of course and how is that going for you?”  ”I hate you”  ”I’m aware.” He took in the elegance of the restaurant. Looking the way she did he knew even if that man didn’t come over right away someone else would. Nonetheless if it’s not him it’s not on the agenda. “It’s quite the place you’ve chosen to practice your craft but I guess business isn’t going quite as planned is it darling?“  She rolls her eyes.  &quot;I apologize” the smirk playing on his lips was anything but. “If you’d like to call in early. I could always provide some…“ He looks her over. ”Distractions“  ”You’re seriously not gonna let that go anytime soon are you?”  ”Deal or no deal Who am I to deny myself entertainment like that when the opportunity presents itself?” He laughs.  ”It won’t happen again I can guarantee you that much.”  ”It was only a little game upset I outplayed you are you darling? You make it sound like I actually brought you harm. Did I threaten you? Touch you or try to harm you in any way?”  ”Touch me? Yes. Harm me?” She scoffs in disbelief. Really her pride was more than hurt. She should have been able to spot him especially being that close. There should have been signs. But it would be weird to start testing her target every single time out of paranoia. “No but you were more than handsy in that car. I could’ve sworn we would’ve-“  ”Can I remind you tried- no you did drug me?”  “They were sleeping pills for insomnia Crowley. Even human you would have lived.” She leans on the table. “And it wasn’t like I was gonna do anything but rob you blind.”  “And that makes it better?”  ”Don’t play damsel demon. Didn’t I say I’m not working for you? You’re wasting your time.”  &quot;So you say.” Amusement clear in his tone. “You’re a survivor this is surviving. Isn’t that all rather….tedious?”  ”You here to ramble about that deal of yours again?”  ”Yes though I do have a new offer. A rather handsome one at that. I’ve thought about what you said and I couldn’t help but agree. You deserve freedom to not…look over your shoulder for everything that goes bump in the night.“ He takes out a velvet box from the inside of his suit jacket. Placing it on the table sliding it to her.  She glances at it before bringing it closer to her hesitantly.  “Go ahead open it.” His smile grew as she took it out admiring it immediately.  “Okay I’m listening” He gets up when he sees her move her hair to the side. Taking the diamond necklace out of her hands and setting it around her neck as it rests into her shape naturally. She could feel her nerves spiking at the proximity her foot taping naturally but quietly. It was hard to look at him the same after the first time. Knowing what he was how he could kill her without much effort. Demons didn’t really care if they made a mess and abandoning a vessel makes the mess someone else’s problem. She didn’t want to be a case herself.  Crowley let his hands linger on her shoulders his thumb stroking her skin as he admired the piece. “Perfect fit.” He gently moves some of her hair further trying to keep it from falling back enough for him to place a light kiss on her neck before continuing with a few more. She tilts her head instinctively her eyes fluttering closed for a moment. Enjoying the intimacy mixing with the anxiety of the situation.  ”It was made for you don’t you think?” He whispers against her skin. She moves away swallowing slightly.  “Show what you want at the end of the day you’re still a demon.”  “And you’re still a hunter.” He sat back down. Taping a glass he claimed near him as a waiter passes them. They both paused as the waiter served him the champagne she selected.   “Ex-hunter.” She corrected.  ”Ex-hunter” He echoes. “Perhaps you beautified the packaging but that doesn’t really change what you are. You wouldn’t see me any different had I changed vessels either.”   Crowley took a sip of his glass slightly savoring it. “It’s in your nature to be cautious as it is mine to be deceptive however I wasn’t lying when I said I bring you no harm.”  “Course you don’t not when you want me to be the one to lead sheep into the slaughterhouse” Knowing he needed her was the only insurance she had to rely on. Despite her stubbornness she knew it was a matter of time before his patience ran thin. The entire idea was…she couldn’t accept a deal like this right? Under the principles she was raised with? Not after the people she’s saved from things like him.   “I can understand the hesitation I do.” Crowley sighs deeply. &quot;I’ve run the numbers thought of candidates and it all leads back to you darling so I’ll be back again and again if need be. The only thing you could do as of now is talk to me.”  ”I’m not killing or hurting anyone for you.” She says almost immediately.  “I’m not asking you to” Crowley shrugs.  ”I won’t let anyone take me to bed if I don’t want to.” She rolls her eyes. “I mean I do stuff for this job sure. But I don’t actually go that far with any of it.”  ”Shame but not entirely unreasonable.” He looks her over.  “You said I’d get immunity from other monsters. Demons are no exceptions” At this point it sounded like she was placing her own terms and conditions.  “Can’t say I didn’t see that one coming back yet I’m not in the best position to grant you full immunity. At least not until I get my own boss on board with the idea” He picks up the champagne. It was decent but not exactly the kind he’d go for given the chance.  ”You said-“  ”I know what I said and I’m sure I can. There’s just a few things I have to do first before I can fully grant such a thing. Even we have people we need to answer to.”  ”What like the devil?”  ”She-devil more like. Hell works like an office there are bosses workers and some that are just considered dispensable.” he huffs amused. “Lilith the first demon in existence was meant to continue his work of corruption so she created a system. It’s sales darling if anything think of it as us doing a favor. One last big hurrah where the most certainly already dammed can ask for anything indulge themselves in their most craved dreams before their light’s snuffed out.”  “My soul-“  ”Would be completely untouchable we’ll add it to your little list of demands. Only as long as you’re employed under me.” He says seriously. “So?”  She looks around. People still very lively enjoying their evenings. “I…I’ll sleep on it.”  Crowley doesn’t remember the last time a deal caused him so much frustration let alone a human. Usually the common go-to rule when it came to forced deals with hunters was to use someone or something they cared about as leverage but this particular deal was important. He needed her to willingly surrender to him. It was all he could think about nowadays. Though he didn’t have the patience for it he endures giving her a smile in response. “Of course You do that.”              She couldn’t sleep she didn’t even bother changing. The most effort she made getting home was taking off her heels and placing Crowley’s gift back in its box letting it stare at her mockingly on the coffee table of her living room. It was stupid for her to even sit here and actually think about it.  Immunity?  luxuries?  The idea was greedy selfish and everything else a hunter should strive to stray from. Conversing with a demon of all things. Any hunter would be after her if they ever found out. What if her dad found out?  “It’s none of his business anyway” she tells herself. Raising her beer to her lips. This wasn’t something she’d bother him with. To be honest she didn’t want to see him at all.  Y/n jumps slightly hearing something upstairs. She places the beer down carefully before bending slowly getting a shotgun she had under the couch. It wasn’t every day that she had personal visitors especially not with how she kept moving about. She went up the stairs carefully trying her best to step lightly but move fast enough to not let the wood creak too much under her weight. She can hear the flicker of a lighter clicking in her room. She pokes her head in with the gun close to her.   A man probably in his 30s dark blue suit his hair slicked back neatly as he took a drag of his cigarette. He smiles immediately as he looks her over. “A L/n as I live and breathe- well y’know as close as I can get to it right?”  ”Who are you?” She pumps the gun a round ready.  ”Easy honey I’m a friend of Crowley’s so to speak. Name’s Issac.” He leans against the wall. He glances at the window seal seeing the salt lined up only a part of it disturbed clearly done from the inside. “I couldn’t help but notice it. I mean hunters are cautious by nature. Every nook and cranny was covered in salt except this window.” He tilts his head at her smirking. “And in the bedroom no less. C’mon doll I knew Crowley’s been working an angle with you but I wouldn’t think he’d get you so riled up.”  Her grip on the gun tightened as she glanced at the salt. “He hasn’t.”  &quot;Really?” He squints. “I mean from what I heard hell from what I saw. Almost felt like I was supposed to turn away or something. It was like some ridiculous attempt at an affair.”  “What is it with you demons and spying?”  “I don’t know. Probably gotta do with our nature. Common excuse you hear with these folk y&#x27;know? Hunters and demons go a long way. Prey and predator. That thin line constantly being played with like some kind of schoolgirl’s jump rope. Though we still got the upper hand ya like to fight back.” He briefly frowns as he brings the cigarette back to his lips. “Always fighting back.”  “What are you going on about?”  ”I just sayin’ I know my onions.”  ”What?” She didn’t like him. Not like this in the temp home she managed to get her hands on in this town. Dealing with demons was unsettling in general. No matter who they were or what meat suit they decided to wear.  ”I’ma be honest here with you L/n I don’t like him. I don’t like the smirk on his stupid face or his voice always complaining questioning one thing after another and you-“ Issac points. “You’ve been his latest obsession and to be honest the second I heard your name-“  Y/n shifts as he takes his time to look her over. Her finger was ready on the trigger. She knew salt wouldn’t kill a demon but a part of her hoped it would hurt him enough. Maybe even inspire a few rounds to go off.  “Your pops”  ”What about him.” She demands quickly.  “He was quite the hunter but he really never knew how to keep that nose of his in his own business. One time he managed to trap me left me to rot for….fuck months I think?” A laugh erupted from his throat as he shakes his head. “Can you imagine that? It’s like a rat outsmarting a cat leaving ‘em in a small confined cage. It’s just not natural.”  ”Do you have a point here?” Her jaw flexed slightly.   “As I said I hate him. And seeing that you are who you are he can’t have you so I got a counteroffer. You won’t know it and I doubt Crowley would have explained it but we got our own ranks within ranks. I happen to be a higher rank than him so any ‘protection’ he offered you would be more guaranteed.”  ”How do I know if you’re lying or not?”  ”You don’t but that’s half the fun isn’t it?” Issac taps his cigarette the ash falling into the pot of a plant she had. “That bastard has been a pain since he first arrived. He’s like a dog doing extra spins to see if his master gives him another treat. Tryna make himself a favorite look Lilith I got the moon for you.”  ”The moon?”  “Not as impressive as it sounds I promise you. ‘Sides I’ll get my boss’s favor in a snap. You just gotta play nice for me.“ He smirks. &quot;And help me get rid of that demon of course. Though to find something that can actually get the job done not the easiest thing to come by.”  “You wanna get rid of Crowley?” She looks him over. “For good?”  “Yeah” Issac scoffs. “Can’t have him rat me out. Even if he lets me have it he’ll find a way to benefit from it. Fucking parasite.”  “Have what?”  ”The colt Y/n I know you have it. Your dad took it then placed it ‘Somewhere safe’. Took me a while but what better place than a hunter always on the move? It doesn’t stay in one area you’re not actively in the hunter business so there’s less of a chance of a supernatural encounter. It all clicks. Now be a doll and hand it over.”  She could play dumb. She should play dumb but she had to take into consideration he might already know where. Especially since he admitted to stalking there was no telling how long. “Over my dead body.”  “y’know” Issac sighs. “I was absolutely baffled when he told me his idea. Getting a dame to lure in anyone willing to trade for a measly ten years of whatever the hell they ask for. I thought to myself ‘Why doesn’t this idiot just posses a nice lookin’ chick and do the same?’ I know a handful of demons who play with different meat suits to get targets.” He nods his head to her the action sending her back into the wall making her drop the shotgun. His lips twitched up slightly wetting his bottom lip as he watched her try to regain the breath that was knocked out of her.  “But it wasn’t just about that. It was the fact that you were human. Selling the idea to them. But you’re a hunter you can think on your feet. You’d most likely get recognized by other hunters which will set them at ease from suspicion faster and the cherry on top?” Issac walks over to her watching her use the nightstand for support as she leans her side on the bed. “You’re a fucking L/n. That’s exciting for me at least. The second I heard you were his daughter. I could hardly focus sweetheart.”  It was rather hypocritical of him to use force when he advised Crowley to do otherwise for favor. Hunters may be human but with what they do and the self-inflicted suffering they put themselves through he couldn’t help but place them as an entirely different species of their own. He pushed her to the bed by her neck pushing his body weight on her slightly. Her hands instinctively gripped his wrist wanting him to let go. His own breath hitched at the sight. He loved it when they squirmed. Though the defiance on her face was clear.  “You’re gonna do it or are you gonna bitch some more?” She managed to get out despite the pain of being tossed around.  “Huh guess the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree does it? Always havin’ something to say despite being completely backed into a corner. Do you know how many deals he cost me?“ His grip tightens leaning in closer. His eyes closed momentarily as the smells flooded in. She took the moment to stretch her foot out to the cup she had on the nightstand knocking it over to spill onto his side.  Issac yells in pain buckling down as the steam erupts from his suit. Y/n forces herself to crawl further up the bed once his grip loosens rolling to the other side to create enough distance for her to think of something.  His groans slowly turn into laughter. &quot;Oh you little-” Issac couldn’t smell her father on her. Only a lingering emotional touch enough to know she’s thought of him but it wasn’t enough to prove he was around. &quot;Here’s the thing. I am jealous. I know he was close but how close was Crowley to you to get his smell on you?”  Her eyes narrowed at him. She really was cornered the shotgun was on the other side and so was the door. All she had was a window and not enough salt to close it. Even if she could she’d be trapped in here with him unless she jumps. The second floor isn’t so bad but the flowers planted below had a brick lining. Jumping on a whim before he could get to her might make for a bad landing.  He forced himself to stand though the holy water still stained his suit. “He was real insistent on it being you. He could’ve gotten any greedy chick willing to jump at the deal but loyalty is something you can’t always buy. The second there’s a higher bidder she’d up and leave. And you won’t say yes you won’t give me the gun so what the fuck?”  This was just a talk she realized. This was his idea of talking. Throwing her around like a rag doll because he was jealous strangling her because he remembered her father. If this was just a talk what was she supposed to expect further down the line with him?  “Plus there’s also your old man right?” Issac smirks as her look changes. “There you are. Y’know I can find him again easily make sure he’s red and blue for you before I take my time to really send him off. Or we can make a deal.”  On one hand she was glad to hear he was alive despite his ways. “You say that like I care. Haven’t been on the best of terms since…ever? It was a great try though. A for effort.”  What was better? Being in the hands of a demon or death?  “So in conclusion Fuck you.” She decides.  He huffs raising his brows in surprise. He nods accepting her answer as he smiles to himself.  “Okay” he shrugs. A wave of his hand sent her through the window the glass breaking from the impact. He sighs as he walks over. Eyes trailing over the new injuries she gained her body arched over the plants.   “What a world.”           Everyone hates an errand run. There wasn’t much to do but wait for a small delivery to be made. Lilith being stuck in Hell made her reliant on the demons that were out of the gates. Being a woman of deals herself she preferred to use crossroads demons. Though the irony of sending them together to run it didn’t fly over their heads. Sharing subtle glances as Crowley made small talk.   Feeling bored as the time passes Issac moves looking at the abandoned cars around them tools scattered and Graffiti at almost every turn. No doubt proof of the warehouse’s new use as someone’s hang-out spot.  Eventually a set of other demons came with a chest setting it down and leaving it to them to complete their part.  “Finally” Crowley sighs looking over the chest curiously. “What do you think it is needing it so badly even if she’s not up here to get it herself?”  “It’s none of our business is what it is. We’re not opening it.” Issac said bluntly.  “Never said we would I just figured if we’re gonna wait for something that long we’d be granted a small note of information or something.”  “You ever heard of the colt Crowley?” He asked out of the blue. “Nasty little peashooter that can shut down almost any creature a hunter could possibly deal with.”  “I thought that was a nice fairytale hunters liked to go on about when things get desperate.” Crowley grabs onto one handle of the chest as Issac picks up the other. Taking the chest to a giant symbol written off in blood on the floor. An entire ritual set up. Both being well versed and educated in more complex magical situations they needed to be the ones to do it.  Crowley never really like doing work like this but better for Lilith than another demon. Crowley had his fair share of bottom-feeding in his past life and he wasn’t willing to take it in this one.  “What’s the point of creating a gun that only had a handful of rounds? Clearly he had the intention to use it for one troubling thing. Even if the gun was around there’d hardly be enough bullets for a hunter to make proper use of it in a world crawling with creatures.”  “Maybe it was more so meant for us. Y’know to be haunted by the idea that hunters would have something to go against things like us or hell bigger if there even is such a thing.” Issac grunts as they put it down. The candles around them light up automatically. They immediately stopped moving to their positions. Holding their hands up mid-chest muttering the needed words. The chest burned up in flames leaving nothing but a scorch mark behind. “How’s your hunter situation?”  ”Silent. Though I’m sure there’ll be an answer soon.”  ”Yeah?” Issac smiles a bit too contently for Crowley’s liking. “Diamond necklace wasn’t it? I’m telling ya girls love jewelry. Course hunters’ such as Y/n have an adequate taste y’know?” He pulls out the Colt. It didn’t take long for him to find it in her house. Placing it under floorboards was a commendable choice but the bedroom was typical. He watched as Crowley shifted in place more serious though a frown clear on his features. Issac couldn’t decide whether to shoot him in his smart mouth or his heart. The irony of shooting a demon’s ‘heart’ would only provide him a laugh rather than actual satisfaction.  “Seems like I struck a nerve.” Crowley hums at the sight. “Colt I’m guessing?”  ”No shit.” Issac pulled the trigger.  It was nothing like he thought it would be. There was a loud bang but Crowley only stumbled slightly from the impact. There was no show of anything else no proof the gun being anything but a gun. For a moment Issac thought he felt it but it was his own body jolting at an unfamiliar sensation. He only had a brief moment left to look down and see the bright lights beaming through his veins.  Crowley’s usual smile returned easily when Issac collapsed. The view of Y/n standing there knife in hand finally in the clothes expected to be seen on a hunter. A grey undershirt her flannel as red as her favorite lipstick he’s always seen her wear. Jeans worn out most likely for repeated wear rather than the use of an aesthetic. Combat boots to endure proper footing if needed in a fight.  In all honesty the sight had been more of a turn-on than her usual dress-ups.  “This must be what damsels feel like when their hero prevails-“  ”Did you know?” She didn’t waste time on asking.  ”Knooow?”  ”About him!” She gestured towards the corpse. “The stalking knowledge about the deal-!”  ”I told you I did my research on you. Issac’s been on my radar for longer than I care to remember. I knew he was going to make a move sooner or later. Though I wasn’t lying I do want that deal settled and your skill set. This was just an added convince.”  “He threw me out the fucking window of my house!”  ”My condolences.” Crowley paused for a moment. “The colt was an added surprise that wasn’t the real thing I take?”  ”It was.”  ”But you did know it had regular bullets yes?”  She shrugs.  ”And you let him shoot it?!” She took pleasure in his offense. Watching him examine where the bullet had hit him.  ”It was an added convenience.” She smiles.  “My suit” He huffs.  ”My condolences.” She glances at the body again. “Do you have to report all that?”  ”To who?”  ”Lilith.”  ”Ah” Crowley simply straightened out his suit. “A little betrayal story would go well. I could say he wanted to take her personal delivery case for himself. Add in my attempts with you- only that worth mentioning of course. But I still need that contract sealed beforehand.”  “Why? What’s the point of even mentioning me in all this?”  ”You want immunity don’t you? This is our ticket in. I’m shown as a loyal demon you’re shown as an asset and we have ourselves a proper start to a successful system. So….is there a deal?”  ”What about the colt?”  ”I’ll convince her to let me have it stored away for safe keeping though you’d have to hand over the actual bullets it came with. And that knife-“  ”You take it and you can forget it.” She steps back instinctively.  ”Fine” He sighs. “Hard bargain but I’m willing if it lets you sleep at night. But I do prefer you leave it on the floor or elsewhere before approaching.”   “Why? Do I have to shake your hand or something?”  “Not exactly.” Crowley smiles. “Listen carefully” he moves to her. “This deal is binding. From this moment onward you will be under my employment. You will do whatever I ask of you. There will be no refusal when I demand something of you. Except for the little list of conditions you decided upon beforehand. Good enough?”  She nodded hesitantly. Even now it felt wrong.  His hand tightened across the back of her hip as he leaned in close to her. His lips brush against hers at first before quickly locking their lips together. It started out with a quick peck but soon turned into a slow steady rhythm. For a brief moment she gripped his suit pulling him close before pulling away.  ”Congratulations.” Crowley licks his lips taking in the taste of her. “You made it past survival.”,2024-07-10 12:34:53 GMT

15,Supernatural,['cas needs a win'  'castiel'  'character of all time'  'spn'  'spn s12'  'cas studies'  'cas'  'spn meta'  'phd in spn s12'  'destiel and betrayal'  'spn angels'  'spn lines'],ananke-xiii,Cas needs a win (or some PTOs really) In “The Future” there’s a really interesting line that I’ve overlooked in the past but that’s actually pretty telling. Cas tells Dean the following:  “And I just wanted… I needed to come back here with a win for you. For myself”.  The “for myself” is quite an important addition because I think that Cas has a tendency to hide his own personal desires needs and ambitions behind Dean and the importance he places on his relationship with him ( famous examples such as “I’m doing this for you Dean. I’m doing this because of you” “I gave everything for you. And this is what you give to me.” “I cared about the whole world because of you” come to mind).  Now of course in and of itself this is definitely not a negative thing quite the opposite since Dean has indeed been a key factor in Cas’ internal and external upheaval. What I’m trying to say is that this is the most obvious excuse for doing/wanting certain things and it allows Cas to get sort of a free pass instead of explicitly owning his wants and needs. By the way Cas is not shifting the weight of what he thinks are his responsibilities intentionally on Dean but I think he sort of lies to himself and uses the “I’m doing this for X reason but certainly not for myself” card as a coping mechanism against his complicated relationship with power and more importantly with powerlessness.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; So when he says that he needs a win for Dean and then honestly adds that he needs the win for himself too Cas is actually showing growth and vulnerability. Of course this is something that Cas can only share with Dean and Dean only. When Kelvin praises him for his betrayal (“Committing to Joshua’s plan putting angelkind above the Winchesters. I mean your reputation in Heaven is –”) Cas is super quick to add that he’s NOT doing it for his reputation but he’s doing it for the Winchesters. Which is 100% true but what Cas is obviously omitting here is that he’s doing it because he needs a win. And he needs it badly. But why?  I’m gonna come out here and say it: I don’t see Cas as a strategist. Like not at all. And if he is I think he’s a very very bad one. Here I’ve said it. I think Cas is on the exact opposite end of what constitutes a good strategist because he’s a reckless son of a bitch. He’s exactly what strategists prepare for: he’s the unpredictable the wild card that can turn the fate of a battle in a matter of seconds and the good thing about that is exactly that you don’t know what he’ll do. He doesn’t even know what he’ll do. As a matter of fact I’ve alwasy found funny when in “The End” Cas calls 2014!Dean’s plan “insouciant” or “reckless”. Because these are the exact same adjectives I’d use to descrive Cas’ plans or Cas in general for that matter.   Having said that war is in Cas’ DNA or whatever in his grace perhaps. Therefore Cas is a wavelength of celestial intent that thrives on winning battles and fighting enemies. But there’s also a streak of ambition and hubris in Cas in that he’s the BAMF that goes against archangels tries to find God by himself and doesn’t shy away from The Darkness herself. One might say he has delusions of grandeur or perhaps he’s a badass with a death wish.   I’d say all of the above. Because to me one of Cas’ defining traits is that he keeps trying. He’s always ready to raise the stakes and regardless of what he says he does have an inner confidence in himself a secret voice that tells him that he can win. Perhaps this is what makes him so charming to people his aura of badass tormented self-assurance.   In s12 Cas’ confidence has taken a real blow he’s scraping the bottom of the barrel. Reasoning in terms of +1 win/-1 fail the season opens with a fat giant -1 for Cas since he wasn’t able to keep Sam safe aka he failed at the one thing Dean asked of him. He gets Dean back though so I’ll count it as +1 for win. All in all things seem to be okayish.   But they’re not a-ah! Another -1 is on the horizon as we are reminded that Lucifer is still on the loose and Cas feels guilty over it and yada yada the usual: I have to fix it because it’s my responsibility. So far Cas’s still not winning.  I gotta hand it to him Cas showed real maturity when he admitted he could stall Lucifer for 3 minutes. Old Cas would’ve just gone in there guns a-blazing no risk assessment and wing it. I’ll give him a +1 for personal win. However they don’t catch Lucifer and everyone and I mean everyone disagrees with Dean when he calls their little fight a win(“Well we didn’t catch Lucifer but we did save the crowd so I’m gonna call that a win). I agree with Dean but I’m the only one so I’m going to give a grand total of 0 because consensus wasn’t reached.  Things escalate quickly from here on: -1 because Kelly escapes on Cas’ watch -1 because Dean and Sam get kidnapped and Cas can’t find them -1 because he can’t even solve a vamp case +1 because no Winchester dies but also - a fuckton of cosmic consequences as he kills Billie.   So to sum it up: Cas’s still NOT winning. Like at all.  We could hardly call &quot;Lily Sunder has Some Regrets” a win. The episode ends on a hopeful note but Cas is totally pretending and performing for Dean’s sake (“Let’s drink and hope we can find a better way” is such a glaring “he wouldn’t fucking say that” for Cas that to me it’s clear that he’s just putting up a front for the brothers’ benefit).  Things go from bad to worse in “Stuck in the Middle with You” which opens with a bleeding Cas who can’t even walk properly and he’s assisted by Mary while we hear this song in the background:  So come on baby walk with a winner  come on girl walk with a winner  hey girl come on swing along with me there’ so much to see  great big world for you and me  I love some good irony. All the more so since we know this time Cas is undoubtedly close to dying for realsies.   Cas dying: let’s talk about it. I think it really stung for Cas that he was about to die at the hands of Ramiel skewered like a fish by the lance of Michael (of all angels!) suffering horribly and possibly forced to watch his family get killed in front of his eyes while he can’t do nothing but keep decaying and dying. Love confession aside for a moment this was a low blow in all its possible meanings for poor Castiel. I think that even though he made it out that barn alive something inside of him was really hurt and broken by the modality of the events as they unfolded. He an angel who had fought archangels and won who just managed to confront Lucifer was harpooned like a whale by a Prince of Hell and forced to die in a way that totally incapacitated his ability to protect his family (he couldn’t even self-sacrifice Cas’ favorite dish cause he was already SO done for). He hit rock bottom in terms of powerlessness.  So when in “Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell” along comes Kelvin I think what truly seduces Cas is not the promise to reunite with and be forgiven by his own family but the promise of power: “I don’t. Look I know you’re working with the Winchesters. Sam and Dean – their hearts are in the right place but wouldn’t it be better to have us waiting in the proverbial wings? All the power of Heaven behind you?”. I think Cas really wants that power he needs it because he needs a win.   Under this light fetus!Jack lending Cas his power to kill another Prince of Hell in lieu of the one who almost got him killed is something way more interesting than the usual “he got brainwashed for the nth time”. Yes true however Cas saying “ I’ve been so lost. I’m not lost anymore. And I know now that this child must be born with all of his power.&quot;is so much more revealing of his character if we consider that Cas finally got his win (he’s not lost anymore) thanks to a borrowed power (he had Jack’s power behind him in the proverbial wings as Kelvin would say) borrowing power from other angels/souls being a thing that Cas does quite frequently on Supernatural lol.  Cas gains his confidence back to the point that he’s back to being reckless and insoucinat with it. While at the beginning of the season he was smart enough to be real and say he could only stall Lucifer for 3 minutes now that he’s got his big win he’s so engrossed with it that he stupidly goes to Apocalypse World armed with a stupid angel blade thinking he can take Lucifer.   Cas needed a win sure but what he truly truly needed were some fucking PTOs from constantly being on the battlefield. Because at the end of the day he sort of got his win but he also eventually got himself dead so what was the point?  I know that on the surface this view might seem to cast a bit of a dark shadow on Cas’ personality but I find him so much more interesting when he’s not portrayed as a puppy cute little doggie doing things just because he loves Dean.

How could you possibly guess that ?”  “You have the look. It’s awful. Arguably worse than fighting a potential future evil version of yourself.”  Dean thinks about that. He compares this experience to the demon him from the dreamroot thing. “…yeah this was definitely weirder.”  Danny shrugs.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; “So… how did you end up in a time travel adventure last night? I think if the Trickster came back we’d see some more signs.” Sam asks.  “Castiel dropped in confirmed the apocalypse stuff.”  “Then dropped you back in time?”  “Yeah… apparently Mom made a demon deal for Dad’s life. It’s why…” Dean stopped himself he barely knew Danny what was he thinking!   “I know?” Danny offers looking between Sam and him.  “Right…” Dean continues. He doesn’t think Danny will go all Gordon Walker on them but if he had all the details… Dean isn’t giving all the details. “Castiel also said it was Lillith who broke the seal.&quot;   &quot;He’s sure?” Sam asks at the same time Danny asks  “Lilith is a demon right?”  “Yeah she’s a demon and I don’t think Castiel would tell us if he wasn’t sure.”  “Any problem if I kill her?” Danny asks. And the quick reaction makes Dean glad he didn’t elaborate on Sammy’s thing.  “We’ve been trying.” Sam tells him. “If you get the chance please.”  Danny gives a thumbs up. And Dean feels sorry that he has to drop the mood even further. “They’re trying to release Lucifer.”  “What’s a Lucifer?”  “Ha ha.” Dean says it would probably be funny if they had any plan for beating ‘a Lucifer’. But Danny… he doesn’t look like he’s joking. Then Sammy’s phone goes off and he leaves Dean to deal with this conversation himself. Traitor.  “Lucifer like The Devil Lucifer.”  “Oh a name got it! You have beef with this guy or something? ”  “He’s going to try to end the world.”  “Think he’ll be better or worse at it than The Pariah?”  “Who’s the Pariah?”  “… guy who yoinked a small town off the face of the earth for a week? Has a skeleton army?”  “What?! Kid are you sure you’re not talking about a cartoon or something?!”  “It’d be hard to forget was around the time Vortex did his thing. Actually a lot of stuff happened then that year was wild.”  “Lucifer will have an army of Demons.” Dean said because if he didn’t stay focused he was going to end up following Danny’s rabbit trails till the world ended.  “Yeah that’s not ideal. Freeing a lot of possessed people is a lot harder than wack-a-mole skeleton edition.”  “I’m not going to ask.” Sam returns to the table. He probably came to the same conclusion about Danny’s stories a few months ago. “That was Travis he wants us to look into something.”  “Now?” Danny asks.  “Yeah there’s this guy Jack Montgomery has something going on with him.”  “Okay 1 problem.” Danny continues.  “What kind of problem?”  “Oh not a problem for you Dean. But I have a sister who has this friend see. And she spent all of yesterday warding off marked spirits and he hasn’t called her back after playing phone tag all day.  Sam swore. Fumbling to get his phone back out of his pocket. His brother had been a mess yesterday. He’d leave a voicemail but be in a situation while she called back. He’d gotten a voicemail after the witnesses were released he’d left a voice-mail then too. Apparently the loverbirds hadn’t actually spoken yet.  &quot;Oooh Sammy’s in the doghouse huh?”  “Not yet I’m supposed to drag him home first.”  Dean grinned “Do I get to meet the lovely Lady?&quot;   &quot;I think you’ll have too though seriously she’ll understand it if this is time sensitive. Mind if I tag along?”  “Not at all Sammy’s a trouble magnet. He could use all the help he could get.”  —  “Don’t you love when this stuff mean spying on a man in his own home.” Danny deadpans. He’s not using the binoculars holding them like they’re personally offensive.   “There are worse parts of the job.” Dean reminds him Jack Montgomery is rummaging through his fridge. “This guy? I mean this guy’s boring”  “I don’t know Dean. Travis seemed pretty sure.”  “Did he give any indication of what we’re supposed to be— oh.”  Oh was correct. Dean watched Montgomery just abandon the leftovers and start in on a pack of ground beef. Raw ground beef.  “I’d say that qualifies as weird.” Sam notes. Like that needed to be said.  —  “Thanks for helping out an old man. I’m a little uh shorthanded.” Travis lifts his cast covered atm and They laugh politely at the bad joke. Then he gets straight to the point and Dean’s glad they’re done pretending to catch up. It’s awkward with Danny lurking behind them. “You track down Montgomery?”  “Yeah we found him at his home.” Sam tells him.  “And?”  “Well he had a hell of a case of the munchies topped off with a burger he forgot to cook.”  “That’s him alright.”  “What’s him?”  “Boys we got a rougarou on our hands.”  “A rougarou?” Dean looks to Sam for a convenient monster summary(or movie title that would work too.). Sam gives him nothing. “Is that made up? That sounds made up.”  “They’re mean nasty little suckers. Rotted teeth wormy skin the works.” Travis tells them.  “Well that ain’t this guy. I mean he was wearing a cellphone on his belt.”  “He’ll turn ugly soon enough. They start out human for all intents and purposes.”  “So what?” Sam asks “They go through some kind of metamorphosis?”  “Yep like a maggot turning into a bull fly.”  “No need to be cruel.” Danny chides. Travis pauses looks at Danny with an expression thats not quite a sneer. Dean really hopes that’s not gonna become a problem.  “They’re hungry things.” Trevor continues ignoring the kid’s glare. “First for everything until they get a taste for human flesh. Once they get a taste they transform. One bite’s all it takes. Eyes teeth skin; all turns. No going back either. They feed once they’re a monster forever. And our man Jack’s headed there on a bullet train.”  “Well how’d you find this guy if he’s a walking talking human?” Dean demands.  “Lets just say it runs in his family.”  “You mean uh…” Sam trails off.  “Killed his daddy back in &#x27;78. Son of a bitch mangled 8 bodies before I put him down. Guy used to be a dentist. Cadillac trophy wife… Little did I know pregnant trophy wife. She put the boy up for adoption. By the time I found out he was long gone lost in the system.”  The air in the room changes this time in a way that’s familiar. The unspoken threat looms…   “You mean to tell me you couldn’t find someone?” Sam asks undeterred. Sam doesn’t feel it.  Travis sighs. “I’m not sure I wanted to. The idea of hunting down some poor kid… I don’t think I’d have the heart. No. I wanted to wait make damn sure I had the right man. Apparently I do.”  The air itself has teeth and breathing takes effort. Travis doesn’t notice either. He takes a swig of his beer.  —  Travis might not notice that Danny is friggen weird but after the comment earlier he does notice that the kid is incredibly uncomfortable. He singles the kid out to prep the flame throwers not letting him escape with Sam.   Dean took a chance and elbowed the kid in his side hard enough to hurt but not hard enough to bruise. Made a face at him and the kid had quit messing with the room’s… well the room’s vibes .   Travis seemed under the impression that Danny was just new to this life and Dean would prefer to keep it that way.  “So fire huh?” They’d been subjected to a few stories of past hunts and the kid had withdrawn more with each of them. Dean wants to change the subject but can’t find a natural way to do so. Better they stay focused on this.  “The only way I found to kill these bastards; deep-fry &#x27;em.”  “Well that’s gonna be…” He glanced at the kid. “horrible. Is that what you did to Jack’s dad?”  “Uh-huh” Travis starts and Dean realizes he&#x27;s being an idiot. That’s just gonna get a more on topic gruesome story but Sam best baby brother in the world saves them.   He walks through the door with an accusation. “Not wasting any time are you?&quot;   &quot;None to waste.” Travis informs them. “The guy hulks out we won’t be finding bodies just remains.”  Sam sits down next to the table in a controlled movement. He’s forcing himself to act calm. “What if he doesn’t hulk out? I did a little homework. Uh I’ve been checking out the lore on rougarous.”  Danny’s head shoots up. It reminds Dean of caged animal seeing possible freedom.  “What? My 30 years of experience not good enough for you?” Travis demands.  “What? No. No I-I- I just wanted to be prepared. I mean not that you didn’t…”  “Sam loves research. He does. He keeps it under his mattress right next to his KY. It’s a sickness.” He looks over at Sam hiding the rescue with some teasing. “It is.”  “Look everything you said checked out of course but uh. I found a couple of interesting stories about people who have this rougarou gene or whatever. See they start to turn but they never take the final step.”  “Really?”  “See if they never eat human flesh they don’t fully transform.” Well no wonder their monster-adjacent friend is freaked. Maybe he’s something similar hanging onto his humanity with everything he can?   “So what? Go vegan stay human?”  “Basically. Or in this case eat a lot of raw meat just not…”  “Right.”  “Good on you for the due diligence Sam.” Travis gets up to pace the room. Its unnecessarily dramatic. “But those are fairy tales. Fact is every rougarou I ever saw or heard of… took that bite.”  “Okay well that doesn’t mean that Jack will.” Sam stands too.   “So what do we do? Sit and hope and wait for a body count?”  “No we talk to him. Explain what’s happening. That way he can fight it.”  “Fight it?” Travis laughs. “Are you kidding me? You ever been really hungry? I mean haven’t-eaten-in-days hungry?”  “Yeah.” Dean answers Danny nods too.   “Yeah. Right then. So somebody slaps a big juicy sirloin in front of you you walking away?”  “No” Dean mutters because he wouldn’t.  “Depends.” Danny challenges.” You know what happens if you eat that big hearty meal? If you haven’t eaten in days ?”  “Uh no.” Dean was never been allowed to eat what he wants after the few times he’d been starving.   “You get sick.” Sam answers. Ok that was probably explained to him he just remembers being hungry and grouchy about it.   Danny nods “If you haven’t eaten in days and you have the right information you eat something small and light that seems unsatisfying until you’ve gotten it all down. You don’t risk tearing open your stomach lining. And besides! How would you know about rougarou’s who don’t turn?! People aren’t going to announce their fantasies of eating people! They’re could be generations who resist and they’d look just like everyone else!”  “And you don’t know that they’re are.” He looks between the two of them. “I’m sorry. I’m sure he’s a stand-up guy but it’s pure base instinct. Everything in nature’s gotta eat. You think he can stop himself &#x27;cause he’s nice?”  “Coconut milk.” Danny declares and Dean almost laughs. He lets the absurd statement sink in for a moment before he continues. “Coconut milk can be used as a substitute for blood. There are vampires who live off it. They get night jobs and exist exactly like everyone else. You’ve had what twenty years? You’ve just been waiting for this guy to crack did you bother to look? Did you ask why a rougarou might crave human flesh?   “Because when we crave salt or red meat or whatever it’s usually because the body is lacking in the nutrients it needs! This all might get solved by giving him a vitamin supplement!”  “We try to help him.” Sam declares. “And we’re not gonna kill him unless he does something to get killed for.&quot;   —  Danny didn’t make jokes when talking to Jack Montgomery. The seriousness was almost as jarring as the conversation.  See Dean’s plan had gone something like this:   1.)Tell the guy what he is.   2.)Convince him they aren’t insane.  3.)Tell him not to eat people or they’d be back.  Repeat step 2 as needed.  Danny started similarly steps 1 and 2 are the same but step 3…  &quot;You’re not alone. There are people I can put you in contact if you want. They might not be the same species but they’ll have similar experiences. They might have other suggestions that will help.”  Danny has a list of substitutes advice a food journal to track what works better or worse. That conversation leads into another and another of things that might alleviate that hunger. Then how they leave…  “I don’t need to tell you why you shouldn’t eat human flesh. You obviously already know. But I will warn you about the change. &#x27;A taste’ is what the stories say and I don’t know if that means a bite or mearly a drop of blood But if the change happens it cannot be undone.”  And Jack nods solemn. He makes his promise and he thanks them.  —  It’s Mrs. Montgomery who finds them hours later. She finds them by asking the diner’s patrons “Who owns that awful van?!”  And Danny the only one in town with a van that awful raises his hand.   She’s confused and frantic but she knows her husband thought they could help with… it’s unclear what Jack told her whether half truth or blatant lie but now everything has fallen apart.   —  Travis’ car is in the driveway.  They don’t have to break into the house. Even if they hadn’t had the keys the back door is already broken in.   It’s not a surprise when they find a body. It’s a carved up corpse not a charcoaled one.   “What happened?” Danny isn’t asking them.   —  “He’s not a hunter is he?” Dean asks his brother. They watch from a room away as Jack Montgomery and Danny Fenton speak in hushed urgent tones. When Jack had turned into the livingroom Sam had flinched and Dean had curled his lip in disgust. Danny hadn’t reactioned and Jack had noticed. So now Danny was the only one worthy of whatever this conversation was.  “He calls himself an electrician that knows too much.” Sam answers.   “How much do you know about how he works?”  “…enough.”  &quot;Sam… I don’t think he’s human.”  Sam looks at him watches his face as he asks “and if he’s not?”  “I don’t know Sammy. I wouldn’t say he’s hurting anybody.”  “Dean I think there’s some things we need to talk about…”  “What?”  “Not here not now. ” Sam gestured to the bloody mess on the ground and the still blood covered man in the kitchen. “When this is sorted we need to talk about what happened while you were dead.”  —  “He’s going to clean himself up and pack.” Danny tells them. “Then we’re going to pick up his wife see what she wants to do then we’re going. I’ll meet you at Jazz’s.”  “You’re taking him to the Coconut Vampires.” Dean predicted.   “Yeah.” Danny didn’t elaborate further.   “How does that work? What if one of &#x27;em falls off the rails or something?”  “They deal with their own.”  “Right… Sam you still have Lenore’s number?”  “Yeah”  Dean nods to him and steps back out of earshot. Lenore the leader of the Cattle-Blood-Instead-of-Human-Blood Vampires probably needed to be in touch with the Coconut Vampires. Dean never asked Sam where they went didn’t need to know. Dean knew then if he’d known where he’d be compelled to check in person and they didn’t need him poking through all their business. Sam kept track of the missing persons numbers where they stayed and they hadn’t needed to follow up.  He doesn’t have high hopes for Jack not really but those two do and others do. Castiel was right he doesn’t have much faith and the least he can do to avoid spreading his doubt all over the place. Maybe they’ll prove him wrong.  He hopes they prove him wrong.,2024-07-10 12:46:04 GMT

My recommendation is more than pleasant for a first drink.”  “Yes well you also thought going after a woman with that wedding ring imprint still present was a good idea.” He smiles at his drink amused before looking at Y/n. “I’d be hesitant to approach him for that if I was you love. Clearly just took it off for the night hoping someone like yourself would come along.“  Y/n gaps at the stranger’s uncalled outing. The married man too embarrassed to come up with a defense decided to stumble away. She didn’t make an effort to call after him she couldn’t afford to. A whole month’s worth of tracking and taking behavioral notes all flushed down the drain just like that. The only thing working as planned was the free drink the bartender barely managed to place in front of her. Improvising wasn’t a foreign concept but nonetheless she was willing. &quot;Thanks for that.” She started softly glancing at him.  “No worries.“ He dismissed. &quot;Doubt he would have made good company anyway.”  “I guess it’s just bad luck on my part.” Resting her chin on her palm she looked around before settling her eyes back to her drink.   “Perhaps.” He looks at her smiling. “Nonetheless if I’m not pushing luck of my own I was wondering if I can buy you another round?”  It surprised her a rather bold move scaring a man away only to move in himself. At least she was subtle about it. Then again him showing interest first helps. She smiles knitting her brows slightly. She admits the other man although shady had a good taste. She liked the evenness of the bittersweet taste on her tongue. “Thank you but I just got this drink.”  “I mean the next one is on me. If you’re willing to stick around after that mishap. Besides I’d be more at ease if you did it’s not really safe to drink alone. Unless of course” His brows went up as she naturally crossed her legs taking the bait. His eyes trailed from her heels to her eyes slowly. “You’re one of those women who can hold her own?”  “Is that such a bad thing?” She laughs lightly.  “It’s dangerous” His grin widens as he hears her laugh. “A girl better said a girl as pretty as you not afraid of getting herself in trouble? It’s a recipe for disaster.”  “What’s the point of living if you have to be afraid all the time? Looking over your shoulder like that?”  ”Hardly a life at all.” He agrees.  “Are you gonna give me a name or are you just a passing stranger giving advice?” Y/n scoffs a smile. She needed a false sense of trust a name could be just as powerful as anything. How you use it. How you say it.  “Crowley” he answered bluntly. “May I know yours?”  ”Y/n” she gives her hand despite the late introduction.  ”Y/n” He repeats taking her hand in his in a more gentlemanly manner bringing it up to his lips for a light kiss on her knuckles never breaking his gaze. “Seems like a perfect fit.” He grins.  There was a small tightness in her stomach. She found herself forgetting her job for a second. When was the last time she actually enjoyed a guy rather than screwing him over for his money?  “Thank you Mr.Crowley.” Then again she was barely grazing the top with this guy.  “You’re very welcome.” Dark eyes such a deep brown looking back into hers. He admired the flush on her cheeks though there was a chance it could have been from her drink he was far too confident to believe it.  ”Tell me” Crowley kept her hand in his. “Why is a beautiful young woman like yourself spending time in a place like this?”  “If you got a better place in mind I’m all ears” she shrugs smiling. This was exactly what she needed for a quick win. An invitation.  He laughs to himself a small shake of the head. “I wouldn’t exactly recommend an evening with me.”  She smirked into her drink making sure he saw her size him up before taking an aim at his ego. “Don’t tell me no good?” She taunts playfully.  He chuckled amused. “Too good for you to handle. In fact I assure you you’ll try to come back to me afterward and I don’t want to deal with that kind of nagging. I have a job to do after all. The drink was merely to show my sympathies for such a misfortune. You spend the night with me and well” his knuckles grazed her leg. “I’d ruin you for other men.”  He smirks at the idea. “A place does come to mind but it’s a bit more….private” he whispered lowly in his throat.  ”Really?” She hums amused.   He nods. “No crowds nothing loud or obnoxious just the two of us with a few drinks talking like civilized people.”  “Sounds like a good time”  “It does doesn’t it?” He stands from his seat bringing her with him linking her arm with his. She tilts her head. He was charming she’d give him that much. She almost found it entertaining. &quot;It’s a little ways from here I hope that isn’t an issue?”  ”By all means lead the way.”  They reached the exit. The valet nodded to them as a slightly stretched car pulled up. The driver in front got off to help open the door but Crowley was closer stopping the man. He opens it letting her in first. The inside was just as lovely. Dark brown leather seats and a side bar with several drinks and glasses to match. Once he got in with her she gestured to the bottle.  &quot;Scotch?” She voiced her thoughts remembering he mentioned it.  “Scotch Craig old stuff. One of the only things I’d let near my lips” Crowley says pouring her a drink. He examined his own crystal before letting his hand rest with it on his knee smirking. “Amongst other things.”  She gives an airy laugh. Her lipstick stained the glass at contact. Crowley watches her in silence before clearing his throat. “Y’know I can’t help but wonder are you just looking for good company or just a few good drinks to get you through the night?”  “I’m entitled to enjoy myself after a week of work aren’t I? Besides I’m a firm believer in letting faith take its course. If the right company did come along with it why not have both?”  He hums in response. “Well that got you near a married man tonight.”  “But you interfered” Y/n reminds him. ‘And the bastard didn’t have the balls to stand his ground.’ A simple comment to suggest he should mind his business was all that she was asking for to continue.  “And now you’re here.” He chuckled. “Tell me are you in the right direction then?”  ‘Far from it.’ She couldn’t help but mentally sneer. Instead she smiles at him. Watching his hand slide up to her knee. Placing her own drink on her holder she pushed him into the seat gently before he could go further. Moves onto his lap as she takes the opening she was presented with. Crowley was only teasing he didn’t really expect her to respond so forward. Though he wasn’t going to stop her. His hand moved to support the small of her back.  “Crowley” She trails her fingers down the lining of his jacket. “You’re a businessmen aren’t you?”  “I am” He hums taking a drink of his Scotch. “But what does that have to do with this?”  “Just curious” She says softly. “What kind of business?”  His eyes roam her figure. She was trying to find the benefit of being with him. “I…import and export goods so to speak.” He manages enough to not overshare.  “Meaning?” She tries to dig.  “Meaning I get a lot of stuff from point A” His hand moved from her back caressing her rear to her thigh before pushing his hand up again to shift the edge of her dress higher nearing the edge of her stockings. “And send them out to point B.” He smirks tilting his head at her. “What’s the matter darling? Don’t I not look the part?”  “I was just trying to make conversation” His eyes watched her curiously when she undid his tie using it to pull him closer for a kiss at the corner of his lips. “Is that such a crime?”  He glanced at her lips meeting her halfway as she took him for a proper kiss. Her fingers slowly overlap his when she takes his glass and sets it aside to one of the cup holders. She presses into him not breaking the kiss as she uses the clink of the ice to cover the sound of the sleeping pills going in. She goes down to his neck blocking his view of his drink. Crowley tilts his head back willingly eyes closed as he enjoys the feeling. His hands held her thighs a light squeeze. His fingers eventually find a garter. His brow knits briefly as he smirks.  Finding a garter in this day and age was rare mostly just for show rather than its actual function. Any man with a working brain would know it was a way to show off her intentions. He couldn’t help but wonder if she knew that. He laughs to himself. Slipping his thumb under the band pulling it before letting it go. A small yelp at the sudden snap escaped her lips. Almost sounded like a moan. He couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride being able to get her worked up.  She encourages his hands to roam to drink to grope anything that’ll keep him from noticing the lack of lip contact. As they stumbled into the hotel laughing at every little thing. She groans when he pressed her against the wall of the elevator. Then again as they fumble into the room he passed out almost the second his body hit the bed.   Dropping the act immediately Y/n took a minute to regain her breath before looking around. A low whistle as she noticed the peculiarity of the fancy room. Though nowadays she’s not exactly roughing it as she did when she was a hunter the luxury of it all still left her in awe. It was neat with no signs of luggage. Not even in the closets and provided safe- which she made sure to double-check.  She made her way back to Crowley. Watching his slight stirs as she went through his pockets. The only thing particularly inviting was the wallet. She relocated the cash into her purse before writing the numbers from his plastics on one of the notepads the hotel provides. She ripped it then folded it into her own little notebook. She went to the bathroom to tidy up her appearance.  It did strike her as odd. Having a room but no actual belongings. Not even a small bag yet he was in a nice suit. Nothing like the ones her father used to get on a whim for a hunt. Was it just a one-day meeting thing? Even if he just needed to spend the night how far would his actual place be if he was sure he didn’t need anything come morning? Why book a hotel room at all?  She pulled out a cigarette from her notebook where the pen usually should be. She curses after realizing she has no matches going back into the bedroom for her purse only to stop at the sight of the man sitting contently against the bed frame. “What’s the matter darling?” He looked up from the purse he held in hand. “Need a light?”  ’Shit.’ Two pills were supposed to be enough for him to last till morning when she was long gone.  “I’m a fan of your work. Kind of primitive for a hunter’s daughter wouldn’t you say?”  Her jaw tightened at his casual remark. The situation was a lot more complicated than she thought.  “Then again most hunters are primitive. I admit seeing your work up close and personal” He shook his head with a light laugh. “What a show. Don’t think Daddy would be so pleased if he heard what you were up to these days.”  “What are you.” She questioned immediately.  “You know in the pit of that hunter’s gut of yours exactly what I am.”  “Export and import business huh?” She scoffs. Y/n looks him over. A more sour attitude than when they first met. She didn’t have much room to fight. Her holy water and salt were stashed in her purse which troubling enough was out of reach. There wasn’t a real proper way to deal with demons exactly. At least from the basics she’s learned growing up.  The whole point of leaving that life was to not feel so tense all the time. And now she was in the presence of a creature who could get rid of her so easily. Yet she couldn’t help but continue talking. “Do you have any idea how much work I actually put into these kinds of things? Weeks. I only went for you because you scared off my guy!”  “Ouch.” Crowley chuckles.  “What do you want?”  “That my dear is the million-dollar question isn’t it?” He leaned his back against the bed frame. Crossing his legs as he looks at her thoughtfully. “I have a proposal.”  “A proposal?” What the hell did she have or did he think she had for him to come looking for her?  Did her dad do something?  “As a crossroads demon-”  “A crossroads demon?” She scoffs a laugh. It wasn’t that she’d considered them any less dangerous than a regular demon but they did like to talk a lot more. Almost exactly like a salesman you want out of your house. Then again she’s never heard of one appearing anywhere aside from an actual crossroad. “I admit I’ve done a few stupid things before but I’ve never actually been that stupid.”  ”There’s a first for everything darling.” He smirks. “Course I’m not here for that kind of arrangement what I want is more of a partnership of sorts. See in my line of business its traditions are” he shrugged as he looked around the room. “For a lack of better words outdated. The world is always changing so why don’t we change with it? Brings efficiency sales go up everyone’s happy.”  ”Except for the poor bastards in the deal.” Y/n scoffs.  He immediately waged his finger to correct her. ”Willingly with consent. We just lay out the deal and our terms it’s not our fault if they don’t read the fine print. I assure you nine times out of ten it’s of their own free will and most likely done some level of idiocy to deserve such a faith.”  ”Loopholes” she rolled her eyes. “You know the tricky little things you can get away with because of your charming talks with the desperate.”  ”Point is There are faster better ways to go about it. That’s where you come in love.” He smirks.  “Not much I can do with a soul y’know at least with what I do I get enough money to keep me stable.”  ”Is that what you want? Stability? Or actual comfort? It’s a very simple concept darling. Course I could charm a poor bastard to do my bidding but I think it would be much more beneficial not to mention entertaining to have someone already skilled in manipulating people to do the work for me.” Crowley smiles at the thought. “I find myself enamored with your little scheme conning men. You’re quick on your feet and from what I’ve seen ways before our official meeting know exactly how to pull on a man’s heartstrings. Willam Evans comes to mind poor bastard ready to pull a ring”  ”Why do you think I left?” She huffs amused. “The long way is fun I get showered with gifts and attention but I’d need to do more than just talk. Something I’m not really willing to do unless I find the guy up to my standards. Staying like that too long makes an ‘attachment’ on his end not to mention makes my face more recognizable. The last thing I need on my ass asides from monsters and hunters- is a man trying to give me a ring.”  “Nonetheless there’s no doubt in your potential. You can go from conning a few well-off men to more important Powerful pursuits men of great influence. With a bit more time and practice of course to perfect such an art. And if you’re good enough- powerful women.”  ”So I should be flattered knowing you think I can play both sides?” She couldn’t help but laugh amused at his suggestions. “Demons are sinful lustful creatures”  ”We all have addictions that make the afterlife more entertaining.” He agrees easily. “ Either way I can’t deny that I’m confident a bat of those eyes is enough to put them in your hand latching on to any suggestions just to hear your voice. A siren dragging a sailor to a bottomless sea is you will.”  “I want you to continue doing what you do best under my name of course and in turn I give you your own pay and desires to live as you please. Money power” His eyes easily drifted down her body once again. “Pleasure”  “Yeah!” She laughs “The pleasure to not deal with things like you. I got out for a reason y’know.”  ”The hunter’s dream after a long tortuous battle right? And anyone in such business with a right mind would know you’re never truly out. I would think someone like you wouldn’t be blind to that assessment yes?”  Y/n decided she hated the man on the bed Crowley. What a name. No doubt it was bound to be engraved into her after tonight. She was right from the start he did demand attention. She wondered how long he’d been watching her stalking her. Did he switch between bodies? At some point she should’ve noticed the smell of sulfur right? Or was she really out of touch with her training?  She needed a drink.  “Protection.”  ”Protection?” He knits his brows. “From what exactly?”  “From what? From everything that goes bump in the night. Even things like you”  It was a good request but it was definitely too tall of an offer. For some creatures sure but there were plenty above him. Lilith his boss came to mind immediately. She didn’t even know he was attempting a deal like this no one did. All he could bring himself to do was laugh a little.  Y/n smiled as she watched him. “You can’t do it can you?“  “You have no idea what you’re asking of me.”  ”You said anything I want”  ”Anything within reason darling.” He corrects her. “I can’t give you something that is so far from my control.”  ”Shame.” She sighs before smiling. “Then I guess there’s not much to talk huh?” She gets up from her seat going to the door with her little notebook in hand. “Keep the purse if you want don’t really need it.” It would be a pain to have everything replaced but really her notebook is all she needed.  “You can’t just leave-“ He looked at her in disbelief finding himself moving quickly off the bed to follow her. He hated the feeling of not having the upper hand. It was another reason he’d need to climb ranks but now to think he had to play nice for a hunter? “You’re willing to throw away such a generous offer? Money and anything your heart desires in exchange for a bit of your time and effort? You can’t be bothered to be content with such things?”  Crowley closed the door the second she tried to open it. It was clear that he was frustrated though at the moment actually hurting her wasn’t on his mind. If anything he hated the fact that she could feel that too.  ”What was it you said earlier? Something about not settling for stability? I don’t know if I’m being honest I tuned out a good chunk of your little speech. Y’know focused on that accent of yours- highly distractive by the way”  ”You should understand that I’m simply looking for the best possible interests for both of us in this deal.”  “I agree but accepting a deal like that is like someone offering me a job that I gotta dedicate my whole life to with the idea of a promised bonus or promotion. No guarantee just a promise that can be broken or changed at any moment. You’d think a hunter like me would know better than to take a deal like that.” She opens the door keeping her eyes on him as she goes out.  ”Ex-Hunter I hear” Crowley huffs the second he’s alone.           It was difficult being as talented and charming as Crowley and still having to deal with something as ridiculous as a rejection. Clearly the deal needed some time to play out in her head. Another thing that was frustrating was sharing his views. Demons were practically born with a defiant streak so chances of getting one a decent one to listen were low.  ”Right so this Y/n” Isaac starts slowly as they walk down the park’s sidewalk. “L/n I know a hunter with that don’t I? Name’s familiar.”  ”Daddy dearest yes” Crowley hums.  ”Ah” he nods. He didn’t know he had a daughter or kids in general. It was an interesting turn of events for a solo hunter. It was common for hunters to raise their kids in this life on the off chance that they do live long enough to produce. “You’re right I do think this is ridiculous. C’mon Crowley? A hunter?”   ”Ex-hunter” he corrects. &quot;Now a con artist. Interesting switch in careers if you ask me.”  ”Still you bring her to the party and everyone will be falling over themselves to rip out a piece” Issac shakes his head with a smile. “Hell Lilith herself might take action and keep her as a plaything maybe even eat her literally”  ”I just need a while to prove this is efficient. I swear it’s a crime to be creative. You’d think Hell of all places would encourage unnatural changes.“  ”Right. Except it’s also full of demons who take pleasure in torture especially a lone hunter-”  “Ex-hunter” Crowley corrects again.  “Even on the off chance that it actually works and no one bothers her who’s to say she won’t turn on you? Please tell me you at least-“  &quot;Under contract of course I’m not an idiot.” Crowley looks around. The park was a lovely place for a walk completely quiet and abandoned the second the sun got low. The lamplights guiding their way.  “No of course I’m sure you offered something tempting. Money? A dead relative?” Issac scoff lightly. Remembering the deals he’s made with humans before. All so completely obsessed and desperate. It was sad to watch but the power he felt over them was addictive.  ”Not entirely I mean I did but she…..wants an immunity of sorts from monsters a peaceful life. All she has to do is sway people to me.”  &quot;Immunity huh” Issac smiled amused at the idea. &quot;A hunter with no morals?”  “No” Crowley sighs looking at the sky for a moment the frustration visible in his tone. “They’re very much there. She just wants the proper motivation for the betrayal to at least be worth the effort. I doubt any hunter would blame her for such a deal if immunity was in the cards. Hate her sure but not blame.”  ”So not only do you not have proof of this idea of yours working the girl isn’t even on your side yet?” Issac laughs. “Ain’t that a tall order nice little dame you gotta butter up first-“  ”She’s perfect” he insisted. “You should’ve seen her work up close her manipulation tactics. Just enough to draw you in and make it seem like it’s your idea. I can’t remember the last time a woman got me worked up so quickly”  ”Pretty is she?” Issac loved the idea the older L/n had been a pain in his side for a good while. Bothering his work trying to save his clients. The idea of a daughter just…  ”The amount of men that have fallen for her schemes you’d think she was one of us. Tempting little thing”  “Or just pretty enough lust is rather powerful y’know for someone to just flaunt it.” He shrugs. Lust could so easily pair with other sins sins that build easily in the human mind. Since the first downfall it’s what built everything they know today. Sure none of them knew they’d be basically stuck in a job for eternity fighting for scraps and acknowledgment the whole ordeal was…..well hell.  Crowley was a tad more ambitious than most though it was unclear if it was because of the useless life he lived before or the enjoyment that came with the power of his status. Higher status more power. Promotions and whatnot like any other business. Issac’s been around a fair amount of years he was younger than him managed to make a higher rank. This business was no different than that when he was alive. To think someone wanted to climb so high so easily- it bothered him that he didn’t think of the idea himself but why her?  ”Why are you telling me all this anyway? You have a plan seems like you’re dead set that it would work. Clearly something you can take on your own no?”  “I just wanted your opinion on the matter believe it or not I value your input Issac. Besides” Crowley sighs looking around the park before looking back at him. “I’m not stupid enough to believe I can do this alone. Even demons have their limits.” Honestly he got excited and needed someone to dump his thoughts. Enough to hear his idea out loud.  ”Well you said your fish ain’t on a hook yet right? Got an idea for a next approach?”  “As fun as the push and pull has been I thought it was about time I pushed boundaries. Mold her into the perfect ideal temptation for any idiot within a mile away from her. She wants freedom I’ll promise freedom.”  ”And Lilith? Your position? Any human would get reckless the second they know they can’t get hurt.”  ”I’ll figure something out what I do know is that I need to get her attention first.”  “She’s a con artist right? Not to mention a woman if I were you I’d get her something shiny.”  “Something shiny?” Crowley chuckles at the simplicity of the idea. “Something simple to match the idea then? A Dimond necklace perhaps? Silver setting elegant but not too much to catch attention. If that fails I’d have to look into other options.”  “Mock all you want Crowley but temptation is temptation. You’re trying to get her to look over her nature as a hunter ignore her morals for people’s lives.” He took out his cigarette lighting it. A few puffs before he continued. “Immunity from monsters is a blessing. More so if you manage to convince Lilith but still the necklace is just a showing. Not only can you give her freedom but keep the comfort you offered the first time around.”  &quot;It’s all about presentation” Crowley nods in understanding. “The necklace is a mere taste of the power and influence I hold. Let her know there are luxurious awaiting She’ll have it made if she works for me.”  “At least then she wouldn’t have to take up side jobs that would take her from your intended goal right?” Issac shook his head as he took another drag. Processing the idea to get to Crowley’s understanding of things. “A human workin’ for a demon.“           Of Course considering the last encounter she chose a location far from the last. There were an abundance of ways to play the game. If anything she’d rather her target approach her instead. Then again it depended on the kind of person they were and who she had to be to get them to notice her the way she wanted to be noticed.  So she sat there this time playing the part of the stood-up date. Probably in his 20s but absolutely loaded with Dad’s credit card with how loosely she’s seen him spend it all day. Leading her to sit in a high-end restaurant this time instead of a bar. She’d send a few small glances at him before taking her time to pretend she was looking for someone. It was going well enough at least well enough for him to turn his full body toward her direction as he subtly talked to his companions.  Unfortunately her luck didn’t last enough the man turned around suddenly with a weird look on his face. At the same time she felt a shift in her booth’s seat.  ”Is this seat taken?”  She took a breath not wanting to cause a scene she smiled looking him over briefly. &quot;What are you doing here?”  “I saw a lovely lady sitting alone pouting and my heart couldn’t take it so I decided to come by and keep her company.” He intertwined his fingers. “And well here I am.”  “I’m working” She huffs lightly.  “Working?” Crowley chuckles. “Of course and how is that going for you?”  ”I hate you”  ”I’m aware.” He took in the elegance of the restaurant. Looking the way she did he knew even if that man didn’t come over right away someone else would. Nonetheless if it’s not him it’s not on the agenda. “It’s quite the place you’ve chosen to practice your craft but I guess business isn’t going quite as planned is it darling?“  She rolls her eyes.  &quot;I apologize” the smirk playing on his lips was anything but. “If you’d like to call in early. I could always provide some…“ He looks her over. ”Distractions“  ”You’re seriously not gonna let that go anytime soon are you?”  ”Deal or no deal Who am I to deny myself entertainment like that when the opportunity presents itself?” He laughs.  ”It won’t happen again I can guarantee you that much.”  ”It was only a little game upset I outplayed you are you darling? You make it sound like I actually brought you harm. Did I threaten you? Touch you or try to harm you in any way?”  ”Touch me? Yes. Harm me?” She scoffs in disbelief. Really her pride was more than hurt. She should have been able to spot him especially being that close. There should have been signs. But it would be weird to start testing her target every single time out of paranoia. “No but you were more than handsy in that car. I could’ve sworn we would’ve-“  ”Can I remind you tried- no you did drug me?”  “They were sleeping pills for insomnia Crowley. Even human you would have lived.” She leans on the table. “And it wasn’t like I was gonna do anything but rob you blind.”  “And that makes it better?”  ”Don’t play damsel demon. Didn’t I say I’m not working for you? You’re wasting your time.”  &quot;So you say.” Amusement clear in his tone. “You’re a survivor this is surviving. Isn’t that all rather….tedious?”  ”You here to ramble about that deal of yours again?”  ”Yes though I do have a new offer. A rather handsome one at that. I’ve thought about what you said and I couldn’t help but agree. You deserve freedom to not…look over your shoulder for everything that goes bump in the night.“ He takes out a velvet box from the inside of his suit jacket. Placing it on the table sliding it to her.  She glances at it before bringing it closer to her hesitantly.  “Go ahead open it.” His smile grew as she took it out admiring it immediately.  “Okay I’m listening” He gets up when he sees her move her hair to the side. Taking the diamond necklace out of her hands and setting it around her neck as it rests into her shape naturally. She could feel her nerves spiking at the proximity her foot taping naturally but quietly. It was hard to look at him the same after the first time. Knowing what he was how he could kill her without much effort. Demons didn’t really care if they made a mess and abandoning a vessel makes the mess someone else’s problem. She didn’t want to be a case herself.  Crowley let his hands linger on her shoulders his thumb stroking her skin as he admired the piece. “Perfect fit.” He gently moves some of her hair further trying to keep it from falling back enough for him to place a light kiss on her neck before continuing with a few more. She tilts her head instinctively her eyes fluttering closed for a moment. Enjoying the intimacy mixing with the anxiety of the situation.  ”It was made for you don’t you think?” He whispers against her skin. She moves away swallowing slightly.  “Show what you want at the end of the day you’re still a demon.”  “And you’re still a hunter.” He sat back down. Taping a glass he claimed near him as a waiter passes them. They both paused as the waiter served him the champagne she selected.   “Ex-hunter.” She corrected.  ”Ex-hunter” He echoes. “Perhaps you beautified the packaging but that doesn’t really change what you are. You wouldn’t see me any different had I changed vessels either.”   Crowley took a sip of his glass slightly savoring it. “It’s in your nature to be cautious as it is mine to be deceptive however I wasn’t lying when I said I bring you no harm.”  “Course you don’t not when you want me to be the one to lead sheep into the slaughterhouse” Knowing he needed her was the only insurance she had to rely on. Despite her stubbornness she knew it was a matter of time before his patience ran thin. The entire idea was…she couldn’t accept a deal like this right? Under the principles she was raised with? Not after the people she’s saved from things like him.   “I can understand the hesitation I do.” Crowley sighs deeply. &quot;I’ve run the numbers thought of candidates and it all leads back to you darling so I’ll be back again and again if need be. The only thing you could do as of now is talk to me.”  ”I’m not killing or hurting anyone for you.” She says almost immediately.  “I’m not asking you to” Crowley shrugs.  ”I won’t let anyone take me to bed if I don’t want to.” She rolls her eyes. “I mean I do stuff for this job sure. But I don’t actually go that far with any of it.”  ”Shame but not entirely unreasonable.” He looks her over.  “You said I’d get immunity from other monsters. Demons are no exceptions” At this point it sounded like she was placing her own terms and conditions.  “Can’t say I didn’t see that one coming back yet I’m not in the best position to grant you full immunity. At least not until I get my own boss on board with the idea” He picks up the champagne. It was decent but not exactly the kind he’d go for given the chance.  ”You said-“  ”I know what I said and I’m sure I can. There’s just a few things I have to do first before I can fully grant such a thing. Even we have people we need to answer to.”  ”What like the devil?”  ”She-devil more like. Hell works like an office there are bosses workers and some that are just considered dispensable.” he huffs amused. “Lilith the first demon in existence was meant to continue his work of corruption so she created a system. It’s sales darling if anything think of it as us doing a favor. One last big hurrah where the most certainly already dammed can ask for anything indulge themselves in their most craved dreams before their light’s snuffed out.”  “My soul-“  ”Would be completely untouchable we’ll add it to your little list of demands. Only as long as you’re employed under me.” He says seriously. “So?”  She looks around. People still very lively enjoying their evenings. “I…I’ll sleep on it.”  Crowley doesn’t remember the last time a deal caused him so much frustration let alone a human. Usually the common go-to rule when it came to forced deals with hunters was to use someone or something they cared about as leverage but this particular deal was important. He needed her to willingly surrender to him. It was all he could think about nowadays. Though he didn’t have the patience for it he endures giving her a smile in response. “Of course You do that.”              She couldn’t sleep she didn’t even bother changing. The most effort she made getting home was taking off her heels and placing Crowley’s gift back in its box letting it stare at her mockingly on the coffee table of her living room. It was stupid for her to even sit here and actually think about it.  Immunity?  luxuries?  The idea was greedy selfish and everything else a hunter should strive to stray from. Conversing with a demon of all things. Any hunter would be after her if they ever found out. What if her dad found out?  “It’s none of his business anyway” she tells herself. Raising her beer to her lips. This wasn’t something she’d bother him with. To be honest she didn’t want to see him at all.  Y/n jumps slightly hearing something upstairs. She places the beer down carefully before bending slowly getting a shotgun she had under the couch. It wasn’t every day that she had personal visitors especially not with how she kept moving about. She went up the stairs carefully trying her best to step lightly but move fast enough to not let the wood creak too much under her weight. She can hear the flicker of a lighter clicking in her room. She pokes her head in with the gun close to her.   A man probably in his 30s dark blue suit his hair slicked back neatly as he took a drag of his cigarette. He smiles immediately as he looks her over. “A L/n as I live and breathe- well y’know as close as I can get to it right?”  ”Who are you?” She pumps the gun a round ready.  ”Easy honey I’m a friend of Crowley’s so to speak. Name’s Issac.” He leans against the wall. He glances at the window seal seeing the salt lined up only a part of it disturbed clearly done from the inside. “I couldn’t help but notice it. I mean hunters are cautious by nature. Every nook and cranny was covered in salt except this window.” He tilts his head at her smirking. “And in the bedroom no less. C’mon doll I knew Crowley’s been working an angle with you but I wouldn’t think he’d get you so riled up.”  Her grip on the gun tightened as she glanced at the salt. “He hasn’t.”  &quot;Really?” He squints. “I mean from what I heard hell from what I saw. Almost felt like I was supposed to turn away or something. It was like some ridiculous attempt at an affair.”  “What is it with you demons and spying?”  “I don’t know. Probably gotta do with our nature. Common excuse you hear with these folk y&#x27;know? Hunters and demons go a long way. Prey and predator. That thin line constantly being played with like some kind of schoolgirl’s jump rope. Though we still got the upper hand ya like to fight back.” He briefly frowns as he brings the cigarette back to his lips. “Always fighting back.”  “What are you going on about?”  ”I just sayin’ I know my onions.”  ”What?” She didn’t like him. Not like this in the temp home she managed to get her hands on in this town. Dealing with demons was unsettling in general. No matter who they were or what meat suit they decided to wear.  ”I’ma be honest here with you L/n I don’t like him. I don’t like the smirk on his stupid face or his voice always complaining questioning one thing after another and you-“ Issac points. “You’ve been his latest obsession and to be honest the second I heard your name-“  Y/n shifts as he takes his time to look her over. Her finger was ready on the trigger. She knew salt wouldn’t kill a demon but a part of her hoped it would hurt him enough. Maybe even inspire a few rounds to go off.  “Your pops”  ”What about him.” She demands quickly.  “He was quite the hunter but he really never knew how to keep that nose of his in his own business. One time he managed to trap me left me to rot for….fuck months I think?” A laugh erupted from his throat as he shakes his head. “Can you imagine that? It’s like a rat outsmarting a cat leaving ‘em in a small confined cage. It’s just not natural.”  ”Do you have a point here?” Her jaw flexed slightly.   “As I said I hate him. And seeing that you are who you are he can’t have you so I got a counteroffer. You won’t know it and I doubt Crowley would have explained it but we got our own ranks within ranks. I happen to be a higher rank than him so any ‘protection’ he offered you would be more guaranteed.”  ”How do I know if you’re lying or not?”  ”You don’t but that’s half the fun isn’t it?” Issac taps his cigarette the ash falling into the pot of a plant she had. “That bastard has been a pain since he first arrived. He’s like a dog doing extra spins to see if his master gives him another treat. Tryna make himself a favorite look Lilith I got the moon for you.”  ”The moon?”  “Not as impressive as it sounds I promise you. ‘Sides I’ll get my boss’s favor in a snap. You just gotta play nice for me.“ He smirks. &quot;And help me get rid of that demon of course. Though to find something that can actually get the job done not the easiest thing to come by.”  “You wanna get rid of Crowley?” She looks him over. “For good?”  “Yeah” Issac scoffs. “Can’t have him rat me out. Even if he lets me have it he’ll find a way to benefit from it. Fucking parasite.”  “Have what?”  ”The colt Y/n I know you have it. Your dad took it then placed it ‘Somewhere safe’. Took me a while but what better place than a hunter always on the move? It doesn’t stay in one area you’re not actively in the hunter business so there’s less of a chance of a supernatural encounter. It all clicks. Now be a doll and hand it over.”  She could play dumb. She should play dumb but she had to take into consideration he might already know where. Especially since he admitted to stalking there was no telling how long. “Over my dead body.”  “y’know” Issac sighs. “I was absolutely baffled when he told me his idea. Getting a dame to lure in anyone willing to trade for a measly ten years of whatever the hell they ask for. I thought to myself ‘Why doesn’t this idiot just posses a nice lookin’ chick and do the same?’ I know a handful of demons who play with different meat suits to get targets.” He nods his head to her the action sending her back into the wall making her drop the shotgun. His lips twitched up slightly wetting his bottom lip as he watched her try to regain the breath that was knocked out of her.  “But it wasn’t just about that. It was the fact that you were human. Selling the idea to them. But you’re a hunter you can think on your feet. You’d most likely get recognized by other hunters which will set them at ease from suspicion faster and the cherry on top?” Issac walks over to her watching her use the nightstand for support as she leans her side on the bed. “You’re a fucking L/n. That’s exciting for me at least. The second I heard you were his daughter. I could hardly focus sweetheart.”  It was rather hypocritical of him to use force when he advised Crowley to do otherwise for favor. Hunters may be human but with what they do and the self-inflicted suffering they put themselves through he couldn’t help but place them as an entirely different species of their own. He pushed her to the bed by her neck pushing his body weight on her slightly. Her hands instinctively gripped his wrist wanting him to let go. His own breath hitched at the sight. He loved it when they squirmed. Though the defiance on her face was clear.  “You’re gonna do it or are you gonna bitch some more?” She managed to get out despite the pain of being tossed around.  “Huh guess the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree does it? Always havin’ something to say despite being completely backed into a corner. Do you know how many deals he cost me?“ His grip tightens leaning in closer. His eyes closed momentarily as the smells flooded in. She took the moment to stretch her foot out to the cup she had on the nightstand knocking it over to spill onto his side.  Issac yells in pain buckling down as the steam erupts from his suit. Y/n forces herself to crawl further up the bed once his grip loosens rolling to the other side to create enough distance for her to think of something.  His groans slowly turn into laughter. &quot;Oh you little-” Issac couldn’t smell her father on her. Only a lingering emotional touch enough to know she’s thought of him but it wasn’t enough to prove he was around. &quot;Here’s the thing. I am jealous. I know he was close but how close was Crowley to you to get his smell on you?”  Her eyes narrowed at him. She really was cornered the shotgun was on the other side and so was the door. All she had was a window and not enough salt to close it. Even if she could she’d be trapped in here with him unless she jumps. The second floor isn’t so bad but the flowers planted below had a brick lining. Jumping on a whim before he could get to her might make for a bad landing.  He forced himself to stand though the holy water still stained his suit. “He was real insistent on it being you. He could’ve gotten any greedy chick willing to jump at the deal but loyalty is something you can’t always buy. The second there’s a higher bidder she’d up and leave. And you won’t say yes you won’t give me the gun so what the fuck?”  This was just a talk she realized. This was his idea of talking. Throwing her around like a rag doll because he was jealous strangling her because he remembered her father. If this was just a talk what was she supposed to expect further down the line with him?  “Plus there’s also your old man right?” Issac smirks as her look changes. “There you are. Y’know I can find him again easily make sure he’s red and blue for you before I take my time to really send him off. Or we can make a deal.”  On one hand she was glad to hear he was alive despite his ways. “You say that like I care. Haven’t been on the best of terms since…ever? It was a great try though. A for effort.”  What was better? Being in the hands of a demon or death?  “So in conclusion Fuck you.” She decides.  He huffs raising his brows in surprise. He nods accepting her answer as he smiles to himself.  “Okay” he shrugs. A wave of his hand sent her through the window the glass breaking from the impact. He sighs as he walks over. Eyes trailing over the new injuries she gained her body arched over the plants.   “What a world.”           Everyone hates an errand run. There wasn’t much to do but wait for a small delivery to be made. Lilith being stuck in Hell made her reliant on the demons that were out of the gates. Being a woman of deals herself she preferred to use crossroads demons. Though the irony of sending them together to run it didn’t fly over their heads. Sharing subtle glances as Crowley made small talk.   Feeling bored as the time passes Issac moves looking at the abandoned cars around them tools scattered and Graffiti at almost every turn. No doubt proof of the warehouse’s new use as someone’s hang-out spot.  Eventually a set of other demons came with a chest setting it down and leaving it to them to complete their part.  “Finally” Crowley sighs looking over the chest curiously. “What do you think it is needing it so badly even if she’s not up here to get it herself?”  “It’s none of our business is what it is. We’re not opening it.” Issac said bluntly.  “Never said we would I just figured if we’re gonna wait for something that long we’d be granted a small note of information or something.”  “You ever heard of the colt Crowley?” He asked out of the blue. “Nasty little peashooter that can shut down almost any creature a hunter could possibly deal with.”  “I thought that was a nice fairytale hunters liked to go on about when things get desperate.” Crowley grabs onto one handle of the chest as Issac picks up the other. Taking the chest to a giant symbol written off in blood on the floor. An entire ritual set up. Both being well versed and educated in more complex magical situations they needed to be the ones to do it.  Crowley never really like doing work like this but better for Lilith than another demon. Crowley had his fair share of bottom-feeding in his past life and he wasn’t willing to take it in this one.  “What’s the point of creating a gun that only had a handful of rounds? Clearly he had the intention to use it for one troubling thing. Even if the gun was around there’d hardly be enough bullets for a hunter to make proper use of it in a world crawling with creatures.”  “Maybe it was more so meant for us. Y’know to be haunted by the idea that hunters would have something to go against things like us or hell bigger if there even is such a thing.” Issac grunts as they put it down. The candles around them light up automatically. They immediately stopped moving to their positions. Holding their hands up mid-chest muttering the needed words. The chest burned up in flames leaving nothing but a scorch mark behind. “How’s your hunter situation?”  ”Silent. Though I’m sure there’ll be an answer soon.”  ”Yeah?” Issac smiles a bit too contently for Crowley’s liking. “Diamond necklace wasn’t it? I’m telling ya girls love jewelry. Course hunters’ such as Y/n have an adequate taste y’know?” He pulls out the Colt. It didn’t take long for him to find it in her house. Placing it under floorboards was a commendable choice but the bedroom was typical. He watched as Crowley shifted in place more serious though a frown clear on his features. Issac couldn’t decide whether to shoot him in his smart mouth or his heart. The irony of shooting a demon’s ‘heart’ would only provide him a laugh rather than actual satisfaction.  “Seems like I struck a nerve.” Crowley hums at the sight. “Colt I’m guessing?”  ”No shit.” Issac pulled the trigger.  It was nothing like he thought it would be. There was a loud bang but Crowley only stumbled slightly from the impact. There was no show of anything else no proof the gun being anything but a gun. For a moment Issac thought he felt it but it was his own body jolting at an unfamiliar sensation. He only had a brief moment left to look down and see the bright lights beaming through his veins.  Crowley’s usual smile returned easily when Issac collapsed. The view of Y/n standing there knife in hand finally in the clothes expected to be seen on a hunter. A grey undershirt her flannel as red as her favorite lipstick he’s always seen her wear. Jeans worn out most likely for repeated wear rather than the use of an aesthetic. Combat boots to endure proper footing if needed in a fight.  In all honesty the sight had been more of a turn-on than her usual dress-ups.  “This must be what damsels feel like when their hero prevails-“  ”Did you know?” She didn’t waste time on asking.  ”Knooow?”  ”About him!” She gestured towards the corpse. “The stalking knowledge about the deal-!”  ”I told you I did my research on you. Issac’s been on my radar for longer than I care to remember. I knew he was going to make a move sooner or later. Though I wasn’t lying I do want that deal settled and your skill set. This was just an added convince.”  “He threw me out the fucking window of my house!”  ”My condolences.” Crowley paused for a moment. “The colt was an added surprise that wasn’t the real thing I take?”  ”It was.”  ”But you did know it had regular bullets yes?”  She shrugs.  ”And you let him shoot it?!” She took pleasure in his offense. Watching him examine where the bullet had hit him.  ”It was an added convenience.” She smiles.  “My suit” He huffs.  ”My condolences.” She glances at the body again. “Do you have to report all that?”  ”To who?”  ”Lilith.”  ”Ah” Crowley simply straightened out his suit. “A little betrayal story would go well. I could say he wanted to take her personal delivery case for himself. Add in my attempts with you- only that worth mentioning of course. But I still need that contract sealed beforehand.”  “Why? What’s the point of even mentioning me in all this?”  ”You want immunity don’t you? This is our ticket in. I’m shown as a loyal demon you’re shown as an asset and we have ourselves a proper start to a successful system. So….is there a deal?”  ”What about the colt?”  ”I’ll convince her to let me have it stored away for safe keeping though you’d have to hand over the actual bullets it came with. And that knife-“  ”You take it and you can forget it.” She steps back instinctively.  ”Fine” He sighs. “Hard bargain but I’m willing if it lets you sleep at night. But I do prefer you leave it on the floor or elsewhere before approaching.”   “Why? Do I have to shake your hand or something?”  “Not exactly.” Crowley smiles. “Listen carefully” he moves to her. “This deal is binding. From this moment onward you will be under my employment. You will do whatever I ask of you. There will be no refusal when I demand something of you. Except for the little list of conditions you decided upon beforehand. Good enough?”  She nodded hesitantly. Even now it felt wrong.  His hand tightened across the back of her hip as he leaned in close to her. His lips brush against hers at first before quickly locking their lips together. It started out with a quick peck but soon turned into a slow steady rhythm. For a brief moment she gripped his suit pulling him close before pulling away.  ”Congratulations.” Crowley licks his lips taking in the taste of her. “You made it past survival.”,2024-07-10 12:34:53 GMT

15,Supernatural,['cas needs a win'  'castiel'  'character of all time'  'spn'  'spn s12'  'cas studies'  'cas'  'spn meta'  'phd in spn s12'  'destiel and betrayal'  'spn angels'  'spn lines'],ananke-xiii,Cas needs a win (or some PTOs really) In “The Future” there’s a really interesting line that I’ve overlooked in the past but that’s actually pretty telling. Cas tells Dean the following:  “And I just wanted… I needed to come back here with a win for you. For myself”.  The “for myself” is quite an important addition because I think that Cas has a tendency to hide his own personal desires needs and ambitions behind Dean and the importance he places on his relationship with him ( famous examples such as “I’m doing this for you Dean. I’m doing this because of you” “I gave everything for you. And this is what you give to me.” “I cared about the whole world because of you” come to mind).  Now of course in and of itself this is definitely not a negative thing quite the opposite since Dean has indeed been a key factor in Cas’ internal and external upheaval. What I’m trying to say is that this is the most obvious excuse for doing/wanting certain things and it allows Cas to get sort of a free pass instead of explicitly owning his wants and needs. By the way Cas is not shifting the weight of what he thinks are his responsibilities intentionally on Dean but I think he sort of lies to himself and uses the “I’m doing this for X reason but certainly not for myself” card as a coping mechanism against his complicated relationship with power and more importantly with powerlessness.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; So when he says that he needs a win for Dean and then honestly adds that he needs the win for himself too Cas is actually showing growth and vulnerability. Of course this is something that Cas can only share with Dean and Dean only. When Kelvin praises him for his betrayal (“Committing to Joshua’s plan putting angelkind above the Winchesters. I mean your reputation in Heaven is –”) Cas is super quick to add that he’s NOT doing it for his reputation but he’s doing it for the Winchesters. Which is 100% true but what Cas is obviously omitting here is that he’s doing it because he needs a win. And he needs it badly. But why?  I’m gonna come out here and say it: I don’t see Cas as a strategist. Like not at all. And if he is I think he’s a very very bad one. Here I’ve said it. I think Cas is on the exact opposite end of what constitutes a good strategist because he’s a reckless son of a bitch. He’s exactly what strategists prepare for: he’s the unpredictable the wild card that can turn the fate of a battle in a matter of seconds and the good thing about that is exactly that you don’t know what he’ll do. He doesn’t even know what he’ll do. As a matter of fact I’ve alwasy found funny when in “The End” Cas calls 2014!Dean’s plan “insouciant” or “reckless”. Because these are the exact same adjectives I’d use to descrive Cas’ plans or Cas in general for that matter.   Having said that war is in Cas’ DNA or whatever in his grace perhaps. Therefore Cas is a wavelength of celestial intent that thrives on winning battles and fighting enemies. But there’s also a streak of ambition and hubris in Cas in that he’s the BAMF that goes against archangels tries to find God by himself and doesn’t shy away from The Darkness herself. One might say he has delusions of grandeur or perhaps he’s a badass with a death wish.   I’d say all of the above. Because to me one of Cas’ defining traits is that he keeps trying. He’s always ready to raise the stakes and regardless of what he says he does have an inner confidence in himself a secret voice that tells him that he can win. Perhaps this is what makes him so charming to people his aura of badass tormented self-assurance.   In s12 Cas’ confidence has taken a real blow he’s scraping the bottom of the barrel. Reasoning in terms of +1 win/-1 fail the season opens with a fat giant -1 for Cas since he wasn’t able to keep Sam safe aka he failed at the one thing Dean asked of him. He gets Dean back though so I’ll count it as +1 for win. All in all things seem to be okayish.   But they’re not a-ah! Another -1 is on the horizon as we are reminded that Lucifer is still on the loose and Cas feels guilty over it and yada yada the usual: I have to fix it because it’s my responsibility. So far Cas’s still not winning.  I gotta hand it to him Cas showed real maturity when he admitted he could stall Lucifer for 3 minutes. Old Cas would’ve just gone in there guns a-blazing no risk assessment and wing it. I’ll give him a +1 for personal win. However they don’t catch Lucifer and everyone and I mean everyone disagrees with Dean when he calls their little fight a win(“Well we didn’t catch Lucifer but we did save the crowd so I’m gonna call that a win). I agree with Dean but I’m the only one so I’m going to give a grand total of 0 because consensus wasn’t reached.  Things escalate quickly from here on: -1 because Kelly escapes on Cas’ watch -1 because Dean and Sam get kidnapped and Cas can’t find them -1 because he can’t even solve a vamp case +1 because no Winchester dies but also - a fuckton of cosmic consequences as he kills Billie.   So to sum it up: Cas’s still NOT winning. Like at all.  We could hardly call &quot;Lily Sunder has Some Regrets” a win. The episode ends on a hopeful note but Cas is totally pretending and performing for Dean’s sake (“Let’s drink and hope we can find a better way” is such a glaring “he wouldn’t fucking say that” for Cas that to me it’s clear that he’s just putting up a front for the brothers’ benefit).  Things go from bad to worse in “Stuck in the Middle with You” which opens with a bleeding Cas who can’t even walk properly and he’s assisted by Mary while we hear this song in the background:  So come on baby walk with a winner  come on girl walk with a winner  hey girl come on swing along with me there’ so much to see  great big world for you and me  I love some good irony. All the more so since we know this time Cas is undoubtedly close to dying for realsies.   Cas dying: let’s talk about it. I think it really stung for Cas that he was about to die at the hands of Ramiel skewered like a fish by the lance of Michael (of all angels!) suffering horribly and possibly forced to watch his family get killed in front of his eyes while he can’t do nothing but keep decaying and dying. Love confession aside for a moment this was a low blow in all its possible meanings for poor Castiel. I think that even though he made it out that barn alive something inside of him was really hurt and broken by the modality of the events as they unfolded. He an angel who had fought archangels and won who just managed to confront Lucifer was harpooned like a whale by a Prince of Hell and forced to die in a way that totally incapacitated his ability to protect his family (he couldn’t even self-sacrifice Cas’ favorite dish cause he was already SO done for). He hit rock bottom in terms of powerlessness.  So when in “Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell” along comes Kelvin I think what truly seduces Cas is not the promise to reunite with and be forgiven by his own family but the promise of power: “I don’t. Look I know you’re working with the Winchesters. Sam and Dean – their hearts are in the right place but wouldn’t it be better to have us waiting in the proverbial wings? All the power of Heaven behind you?”. I think Cas really wants that power he needs it because he needs a win.   Under this light fetus!Jack lending Cas his power to kill another Prince of Hell in lieu of the one who almost got him killed is something way more interesting than the usual “he got brainwashed for the nth time”. Yes true however Cas saying “ I’ve been so lost. I’m not lost anymore. And I know now that this child must be born with all of his power.&quot;is so much more revealing of his character if we consider that Cas finally got his win (he’s not lost anymore) thanks to a borrowed power (he had Jack’s power behind him in the proverbial wings as Kelvin would say) borrowing power from other angels/souls being a thing that Cas does quite frequently on Supernatural lol.  Cas gains his confidence back to the point that he’s back to being reckless and insoucinat with it. While at the beginning of the season he was smart enough to be real and say he could only stall Lucifer for 3 minutes now that he’s got his big win he’s so engrossed with it that he stupidly goes to Apocalypse World armed with a stupid angel blade thinking he can take Lucifer.   Cas needed a win sure but what he truly truly needed were some fucking PTOs from constantly being on the battlefield. Because at the end of the day he sort of got his win but he also eventually got himself dead so what was the point?  I know that on the surface this view might seem to cast a bit of a dark shadow on Cas’ personality but I find him so much more interesting when he’s not portrayed as a puppy cute little doggie doing things just because he loves Dean. Of course he does lol but he’s so much more than that and a lot of his character has clearly to do with power and how it corrupts and entices people or well beings in general that I think it’s worth exploring.,2024-07-10 12:12:02 GMT

There was a year missing from Sam’s book a year in which Sam had no idea what Dean had done a year which was left only to his nightmares. Purgatory was pure Dean had said. Purgatory had brought out all that was inside him and let it gush forth. It was a world of simple survival of give and take and struggle and desire. And Dean had spent that year with Benny. With a vampire.  Sam had only his own thoughts to imagine what had happened there and purity was far from the word he would use to describe what those thoughts supplied. The way this vampire looked at Dean was with a hunger as if the fangs would come out and he would launch himself at Sam’s brother if only a second more passed. He never did but Sam could never stop staring anticipating the attack because that’s what monsters do. They attack and feed and hurt and kill. They destroy families and leave carnage in their wake and they try to separate Sam from Dean and keep them away and apart. And Benny was a monster—of this Sam was sure.  Sam stared down at Benny their chests nearly touching and snarled. Benny returned the favor his second set of teeth poking out from under his lip in a warning in a dare. Don’t try anything he was saying; you’ll regret it.  Sam regretted a lot of things in his life; the laundry list of guilt piled so high by now that it seemed to stretch beyond even the sun. He wouldn’t know where to begin asking forgiveness or retribution or punishment because his sins were endless and still piling ever higher with every sinful breath he poisoned the air with. He had regrets; that wouldn’t be one of them.  A vampire’s skin was cold. Where Benny and he were nearly touching he could feel it mingle with the heat radiating from his own body and with a mild shock Sam realized he shouldn’t be here in such lingering proximity to a monster like this. He should have learned from his mistakes. He was a hunter and hunters shouldn’t linger: you kill the monster you clean off your blade or your gun or your hands and you walk away. You don’t press yourself against it and wonder what your brother felt when he did the same for a year before that. You don’t stare at its fangs and wonder if it ever tasted your brother’s blood and wonder what your brother’s blood tastes like if it’s tangy or sweet or sour with decades of sin. And you certainly don’t wonder how far they went if the monster ever whispered in your brother’s ear or caressed his body in its large meaty hands if they ever fucked and who was on top and who screamed whose name (or if that name was Sam God let it be Sam).  Benny said nothing and did nothing like a predator watching his prey like a prey animal frozen under the watchful eye of his hunter. He merely waited for Sam to make the next move. The world was quiet around them and yet thundered with explosions and questions and desire. Sam wanted to know everything but his mouth was still and uncooperative.  Dean wasn’t here or they would have been broken apart already. Dean was one state over researching a case and conducting interviews and looking at corpses. Sam would have to get back before Dean realized he had gone before he started freaking out. A year apart and nothing changes; a year apart and everything changes.  Dean wasn’t here but Benny was. Benny would tell Sam anything he wanted to know and he would do it in a delicious slow drawl sucking on each word like it was rich sweet chocolate a contented smile upon his lips as he tore Sam’s world apart like clean wet slice of a machete to a neck. Sam only had to ask and Benny would provide—it’s that Southern hospitality maybe or possibly something more malicious and spiteful.  But Sam’s mouth didn’t work. He didn’t want to know not really and yet he did. A year apart and everything was different. Dean was different; Sam could feel it could feel the danger rolling off of him and the raw feral energy coiled inside of him like he was always ready to strike. He walked around restless waiting for something waiting for someone. He looked at his phone and put it away and pulled it back out and looked at it and put it away again. Sam wasn’t part of Purgatory. He was apart and away from Dean and Dean was in Purgatory and Benny was in Purgatory too. And they’d been together and he’d been here. And Benny was more of a brother to Dean than Sam ever was.  Sam wondered if Benny could smell Dean on him or if they’d been apart and away for so long that the scent had died on his clothes and on his skin. He wondered if there was anything left of Dean on him or if he was a stranger now and Dean had left him behind. He wondered if were he a vampire too he would be able to smell Dean on Benny.  He needed to know and he couldn’t ask. He couldn’t know what happened and he couldn’t live not knowing. Did they touch did they kiss did they do all the things Sam couldn’t while he was stuck here and they were in Purgatory together—did Dean think of him when he fucked Benny? Did Benny make the same noises did Benny sound like him when he cried out? Did Dean imagine it or did he ignore it? Did Dean even care? Did he ever care? Was Benny more of a brother to Dean than Sam had ever been?  Sam grabbed Benny’s face and held it still as he bent down and kissed him. He trailed his tongue along the vampire’s lips and the fangs nicked his skin and he bled into both their mouths and Sam tasted Dean there distinct under the tang of blood and the sweat of the monster.  And Sam knew everything and instantly achingly he wanted nothing more than to forget.,2024-07-10 14:35:09 GMT

For the longest time he tries to deny that’s what it is but when he’s inside you looking into your eyes kissing your lips he can’t pretend anymore.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; It’s a problem he struggles to reconcile when he’s away because attachments are dangerous in his profession they can get a person killed. That’s why he stays away for as long as possible why he doesn’t call doesn’t text. He tries to forget you but you’re there always in his dreams in his heart.  When he finds himself back in Tennessee he tries to ignore the pull he feels in his chest the ache that only seems to grow with every passing day until it overwhelms him and he ends up back in your bed again.  “You should probably leave.” You always say when he turns up on your doorstep.  “I probably should.” He agrees but he stays for a beer and then dinner and before he knows it it’s three days later and he’s watching you sleep on the pillow alongside him wondering how he’s such a lucky son of a bitch.  “It’s the mountain.” You laugh when he tells you he doesn’t know where the time has gone but he knows it’s you it’s always you.  “You should stay in Gatlinburg with her.” Sam tells him when they catch up a week later in Memphis. “It’s clear she makes you happy. You always come back with a smile.”  “We both know what happens to the things that make us happy.” Dean responds as he throws his bag onto the motel room bed and Sam he can’t argue with that.  It’s as he lies there in the darkness that night listening to the sound of Sam’s rhythmic breathing he closes his eyes and imagines he’s back with you in a cottage on the mountain falling in love all over again.

0,Supernatural,['dean winchester'  'spn'],calaryssia,Unexplainable | Happy Days Unexplainable Masterlist  Dean Winchester X OC  (This is unedited sorry for the lowercase)   Word Count: 2.7k  tears fill my eyes as i sit next to my grandmother holding her hand in mine. She looks at me with a pang of sadness as she watches the tears stream down my face.  “el don’t be sad. It’s my time. no one can change that. not even me.” she says squeezing my hand. “You have so much potential with your witchcraft. you are the most powerful witch i have ever met and you are even more powerful than me. and you know how i am so you know that’s a high compliment.” she says smiling at me. I laugh a little tears still coming down my face.     &lt;!-- more --&gt; “You are still my little precious granddaughter but the woman you have become amazes me. even when your fate was revealed in front of you you fought with everything in you to survive. You are the strongest individual I have ever met. you’ve made me proud belle.” a tear comes down her face. “Now let me talk to your brother.” she says squeezing my hand. I nod and get up heading for the door where my dad and brother were waiting. I nod to Trey for him to go in. He sits next to her as she smiles at him.  “She loves you a lot.” my dad says putting his hands on my shoulders. I turned to my dad to see him staring at us with the same amount of sadness I had. We embrace each other in a hug as I feel his tears fall onto my shoulders. my breath hitches as the liquid steals.  I see my mom behind him hurt across her face. I look at her sympathetically. Even if we had fought just days before I knew we would go back to how we were before. we would just avoid the subject. like we always do.  I pull away from my dad and he wipes the tears away from his checks. He always hated being vulnerable around me. When his father died when I was ten that was the first time I ever saw him cry. The second was when I told him and my mom that Lucifer was after me and that I needed to leave for a while. The third time is now.  he moves away from me into the room grandma was in. Trey comes out and gives me a look. “Can we go to that diner that she always took us to. she wants a milkshake.” he says trying to mask his emotions.  “yeah i’ll go get my keys.” I nod as we both head to the door. We walk outside and Trey suddenly stops as we get close to the car. I turned around looking at him confused. “What’s wrong?”  Trey breaks down almost immediately tears start streaming down his face. I rushed over to him and brought him into a hug. “oh bubba.” I say tears welling up again.  “I don’t want to lose her.” he says hugging me tight. We hugged each other in the middle of my grandmother’s yard outside of little rock arkansas.  “It’s going to be okay bubba.” I say pulling away from him staring at him in his tear filled eyes. “Now let’s get her that milkshake.” I say smiling slightly.   When we got back my dad was sitting by my grandma as they laughed together. They always had a really close relationship. she’s the one that taught him everything there is about being a witch same as my mom’s mom did with her. I smile as me and Trey walk in. Trey comes by her bed handing her the milkshake she takes it gladly.  my mom comes up behind me she puts her hand on my shoulders causing me to turn around. she smiles sadly at me before motioning me to step outside and talk to her.  we get outside and she turns to me bringing me in a hug. I sigh hugging her back. There have been a lot of hugs lately.  “I’m so glad you’re okay.” she mumbles into my hair. I pulled away looking at her confused.  “What do you mean?” she looks down before looking back up to me. She has the same look every time she’s about to start an argument.  “I’m just glad when you came back from being with the winchester’s you were in one piece.” she says crossing her arms over her chest.  “of course you would try to argue with me now of all times.” I say rolling my eyes looking away from her.  “Belle every time you get hung up with those winchester’s you end up hurt. whether it be emotionally or physically. I don’t understand why you keep going back to them. even if it’s just work.” she says raising her voice.  “you and I both know that i can relate to the winchester’s more than anyone. who was there when we all had been told our fate and that we couldn’t change it but we did. and if it wasn’t for sam freaking winchester i would be used as a magic bag every single day of my miserable life. i owe him everything because of what he did for me and everyone on his earth. he sacrificed his own life. isn’t that more then enough to help them out? we risk our lives everyday why not do it for someone that deserves it?” i say full force yelling at her.  “hanging out with the winchesters will just put a bigger target on your back.” she shouts causing my brother to come out of the house but we both ignore him.  “the target is already there! i can’t get away from it! ever! i will stay been chased especially with all of the archangels still out there alive! and who ever the hell else that can drain my ass till their time is up! so honestly some of the only people that will protect me are those guys.” i shake my head as i go toward my brother and the door.  “we are not done here belle anne!” my mom shouts at me using my middle name. i roll my eyes.  “after this is all over i’m getting my ass out of dodge and going to be with my friends.” i say moving past my mom into the house.  the next week we all stayed with my grandmother. the last few days of her life were happy. joyful. she gave me the rest of her journals for me to read later. all of them containing ways of her advancing in her witchcraft. some of them just have her day to day life. even when she got married and had my dad. i looked forward to reading more on her life.  i was in my bed had just woken up my dad sat next to me running his hands through my hair. i look up at him to see his tear stained checks still red from crying.  “hey ellie” he paused for a second. “she passed in her sleep.” he said sadly. i shoot up bringing him into a hug. he hugs me back tightly. we stay like that for a second before he pulls back.  “listen i know what your mom thinks about the winchester’s but i just want you to know that i am all for you helping those boys out. sam especially. and you tell them if they need anything they can call me too.” i nod knowing my dad means it. he gets up heading for the door.  “i love you kid.” he says as he turns around for a second. he leaves me there kind of out of words. i sigh before laying back down as the tears start coming up. she’s gone. she’s really gone.   i decide to call dean to fill him in i didn’t call them like i said i would. i kind of got wrapped up in everything.  “hey dean.” i say sighing into the phone.  “hey how’s everything going? you never called.”  “yeah kind of got wrapped up in everything. my grandma… she’s was sick and i raced down as soon as i heard. she um she died in her sleep last night.”  “oh i’m really sorry to hear that belle.”  “uh it’s fine. i’m gonna be here for a couple of weeks. the whole funeral and making sure my brother and dad are good before i head out.”  “hey you don’t have to come back. you can stay there as long as you need.”  “thanks dean but i think that my grandma would have wanted me to keep doing what i’m doing. which is helping you both with all that’s going on in this world.”  “okay i get it. well call me when you’re planning to come back.”  “okay i will. tell sam i said hi.”  we exchange our goodbyes before i close the phone. i sigh going into the kitchen to grab a snack. as i enter the kitchen my brother is sitting on the counter reading through some book he found that was grandma’s. i open the fridge and get a canister of watermelon out. i shut the fridge and go over to him and sit up on the counter.  “what are you reading?” i say motioning to the book.  “it’s one of grandma’s journals it’s when you were born. it sounds like she thought you were going to be the natural witch. the chosen one. she talks about how michael’s sword is supposed to be the person you marry. it’s weird.” he says flipping to the next page.  “dean? how he’s not even into me. he has a girlfriend and she has a kid. they’re his family.” i say taking a bite of the watermelon.  “well it’s either him or lucifer’s vessel.” i stare at the journal in his hands. how did she know all of this.  “so sam or dean could be the person i’m supposed to spend my life with and she never mentioned it?”  “like i said she wasn’t one hundred percent sure. she talks like she knew of the legend. she never told us before so why keep it to herself.”  “i guess she didn’t know if i was or not. just a theory. that makes sense to why she told me what she told me about them. how i should help them and stuff like that.”  “she knew that you would end up with one of them. my bets are on dean. he has a cool car.” i roll my eyes.  “of course you would say that.” i jump off of the counter and turn to him. “like before i’m not gonna let fate control my life. right now there’s obviously no feeling between either of the boys and me. so maybe grandma was wrong.” just then my dad walks into the kitchen opening the fridge to get a drink out.  “what are your kids talking about?” he asks turning to us as he leans up beside the fridge on the counter.  “nothing.” i say not wanting dad to join the conversation.  “just how grandma thought el is supposed to end up with one of the winchester’s.” i hit trey obviously not wanting my dad to know.  “well that woman was never wrong. my bet is on dean he seems like your type plus how he reacted when i asked which one of them liked you. that was a clear give away. i mean that sam boy he was giving you the eyes the whole time he was at the house so. could be either of them.” he says before taking a sip of his coke.  “you are both crazy.” i say pointing at both of them. i throw the left over watermelon i had in the trash which was practically none. “i’m going back to my room.” go to my room and shut the door. why does my fate always have to be put in front of me.  the funeral was the next week that part was sad. the party after which was put into place via my grandma’s plans was very fun and light hearted. everyone was telling great stories about her. bobby had stopped by right now he was talking to my dad.  when bobby was done with his conversation with my dad i went up to him and hugged him. “thanks for coming.” i say before pulling away from him and smiling.  “i wouldn’t miss it kid. sam and dean would have come but they’ve been kind of preoccupied recently. you know with sam being soulless and everything-” i cut him off quickly.  “wait wait sam doesn’t have a soul?” i say confused since when has this been a thing.  “dean didn’t call you? i mean he figured out that you knew sam was alive during that year but i thought that he would get over himself and tell you. you and sam are pretty close now.” i shake my head. i can’t believe dean didn’t call me. he must be really mad.  “no he didn’t. he must be really pissed off at me.” i sigh looking away. “do y&#x27;all know how to get it back?”  “we’re working on it.” i look back up at him and smile.  “it’s fine listen i have to make the rounds but i’m glad you came. i’ll probably call dean later try to get him to not be mad at me forever.” i say and he nods as i turn and go off to greet someone else.  “so you want to tell me something?” i say anger dripping from my voice.  “bobby told you.” he scoffs. “you shouldn’t care that much. you had been with him for a year and didn’t see that we was acting completely different.”  “i did dean but i just thought it was hell. he was trapped in lucifer’s cage even if it wasn’t for long doesn’t mean he didn’t live through it. hell time is different then ours. you should know that hell changes a person.” i shout into the phone probably waking up my brother who was asleep next door.  “yeah well what happened to you been able to sense things when they are wrong. you probably didn’t care since he was flirting with you twenty four seven. you didn’t think that the real sam would have been a little less sexual with you.”  “dean! we were with each other for months. and i don’t necessarily think that i’m that hard to flirt with unless you think otherwise.” i pause for a second and dean’s side of the line was silent. “listen i don’t want to fight with you dean. i just thought that maybe you could stop being mad at me. or at least act like you aren’t. because when i come back i don’t want it to be like this.”  “why are you even coming back?” dean says hatefully. i can’t believe he just said that.  “because you guys are my friends and no matter how hard you try to be mad at me constantly i’m still going to be there for you and sam. even my grandmother wanted me to along with my dad. sorry dean you aren’t going to get rid of me that easily. we lived through the apocalypse together where nothing was supposed to end in our favor but it did. and since sam went to hell for us for me. i thought i should repay the favor as much as i can. which means helping y&#x27;all with your cases and everything that is going on. now do you have an idea of how you’re going to get his soul back or not?” my southern accent was coming out like it always did when i was mad.  “i’m going to talk to death. see if he can do anything cas can’t because it’ll be to risky so i’m going for the next best thing.”  “okay when should i be there.”  “i’ll call you before i do it. so by the time it should be done you’ll probably be here.”  “okay.”  “okay.”  “bye dean.”  “bye belle.” i hang up the phone and stare out the window into the sky. the moon and stars were out and they were beautiful.,2024-07-10 17:13:49 GMT

Dean was in an unusual mood not a bad one when he’s grumpy and doesn’t say a word. He actually talked a lot commented on anything he’d hear on the radio or see on the road. It seemed like he was trying to keep things casual but I sensed he was a bit nervous. I didn’t understand why. It was just a kiss he and I shared.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; As we were standing outside the large abandoned power plant Sam called our host for her to opened the bunker door for us.  “Password!” We could hear her from the other side. Dean tensed again.  “Uh- Liv you’re seriously gonna ask me everytime I come here?” Sam sighed rolling his eyes. But Liv didn’t open until he spoke again. “Jeez- ‘Mellon’.”  The door to the airlock opened and we just had the time to catch a glimpse of her figure who was already coming gown the stairs of the bunker’s crow’s nest.  “It’s elvish for ‘friend’ Sammy I know the nerd that you are appreciates the reference!”  I had come to this old underground bunker a few times when Liv and I were looking for Dean but it was my hunter’s first time here and I could see he was fairly impressed as we stepped in the long library room. Sam dropped his bag on a table obviously also familiar with the place and sat on a chair as Liv hopped to sit on a table. I was more comfortable just standing and Dean did the same keeping his distance.  “So did you dig up anything new?” Sam asked our host.  “I knew you’d ask of course I did my homework!” Liv turned to face the youngest Winchester sitting cross-legged on the table. She seemed in a good mood. “Since we found out last time that this Mark of Cain is demon-related I made a couple phone calls. Well summoning calls whatever.”  “Summoning? Liv tell me you didn’t-”  “What? Sam we agreed we’d look into any solution to- help Dean so I dug up solutions. So yes: I called Crowley.”  Dean sighed crossing his arms. “And here we go.” I had heard that Liv’s methods during the Apocalypse didn’t always fall right with Dean so I knew this was precisely the reason why he was reticent to work with the witch again. That or their past relationship. Surely both. “So your sly pet wasn’t enough you’re working with Crowley now?”  Liv didn’t seem to appreciate his remark. “Barb’s not my pet he’s my friend.” She climbed down the table and went to grab her pack of smokes on one of the shelves and lit one with just the use of her fire-weilding powers. “And Crowley’s been helpful. He told me a few interesting things about that Mark.”  “Such as?” I asked eager to get to the bottom of this for Dean’s sake.  Liv turned to me that same old determined look on her face when she’s confident about what she’s doing. We had faced our share of fights and talks together I trusted her. “Such as- this Mark being sort of a binding spell. It might be demonic it’s still witchcraft. So kinda my department.” She grinned giving Dean a glimpse exhaling some smoke.  “A binding spell?” Sam asked.  “Yeah more or less. Normally a binding spell is used to connect one’s wielder with its target’s powers like- like Lucifer had the Horsemen on a leash. Here it’s a bit more tricky. The Mark binds its host with- their inner-self? Think of a hula hoop but you sway and it throws you off the hook. Wait- no forget the hoop that was stupid metaphor. Hmm-” Liv was thinking out loud her fingers tapping on her cigarette that made sparks as she was looking for another idea the gears on her very quick-witted mind almost visible. “Booze. You know- people drink to loosen their inhibitions but when they drink too much they can get a little- extra.” The Winchesters and I were all a little lost and she noticed. “The Mark taps into inner… emotions and… unleashes some others.” She brought her cig back to her lips. “Dean- anything new on that department lately?”  I turned to look at him his arms still crossed over his crossed and noticed he clenched his jaw. I could sense this was uncomfortable.  “Hm- there’s been the angels.” I stepped in knowing Dean wouldn’t answer her. “We got attacked by a squad last week and… Dean took care of them.”  “A squad? That’s what- 4 5 angels?” She whistled impressed. “Okey- so a little extra violence. Won’t say I’m surprised.”  “And what is that supposed to mean?” He barked back. She didn’t appreciate.   “That means- that what Crowley told me was right. The Mark’s gonna… Well I’ve never seen anyone walking around without one but most likely it’s gonna eat your soul.” That finished to sink the tense atmosphere in the room. “It- It’s of demonic nature I won’t do you the offense to witchsplain to you what demons do to a soul. For whatever reason Heaven gave you this I’d say it’s some kind of twisted punishment.”  “A punishment?” Sam asked.  “Yeah. Crowley’s still pretty grateful to me since I cleared the way of an annoying archangel for him making him King of Hell but upstairs? Raphael must be pretty wrathful he lost his big brother.”  “Michael’s gone so Heaven punishes his Sword…” He mumbled turning to me for confirmation.  “It’s a- plausible theory.” I replied well-aware that my former superiors were never short on new twists to manipulate humans especially the Winchesters. Especially Dean.  “Great… Well that’s just peachy.” Dean grunted as he started pacing the room. I hated to see him like that disoriented when he’d usually always be so fierce so determined into whatever plan we’d have. Most of all I felt guilty being helpless to help him as much as I should. I thought he’d deserve a better angel. “Any place I can get a beer down here?”  “I- I’ll show you the way to the kitchen.” Sam stood up giving our host a glimpse that said he’d handle his brother for now.  Liv finished smoking her cigarette and I just kept standing here.  “How you doin’ Collins?” She finally broke the silence calling me again by that old nickname. I wasn’t sure how to reply to her. To what extent I should reply to her.  “I’m fine.”  She chuckled not hiding her sarcasm. “Yeah. Sure everybody’s fine. What about your angel toolbox? Still missing a couple things?”   “Hm- yes. It’s gradually coming back but…”  “But what?”  “I- I got most of my strength back. And I can feel my vessel can regenerate again if he’s hurt.”  “And your wings?”  “Not yet.

I knew he’d refuse but a part of me wanted Dean to stay in that bunker even with Liv around so that he’d be safe. If anything were to happen to him I still hadn’t gained back my healing touch.  “Cas… You don’t need your glowing miracle-maker thingy to be useful. Just- you stay here with Dean. We can’t have him go berserk again it’s too risky…” I saw her thinking again a fierce look on her face. “I’ll call Barb we’ll find some angels see what more we can learn. You guys stay here.”  “Angels?” I frowned surprised that my witch friend would propose to leave the bunker to us. “Liv I thought you were avoiding them since the Apocalypse.”  “I was.” She replied and I noticed something weary in her tone. “But they decided to mess with Dean. Looks like I’m gonna fly at them again.”  _______  Masterpost with the Prompts List,2024-07-10 18:32:59 GMT

She couldn’t fall asleep even at eight years old she was worried about school and what her friends were doing.   Dakoda was startled when she saw light flickering over her closed eyelids the brightness from her lamp fading and dimming before getting brighter once more Dakoda’s eyes shot open and she stared at the flickering lights in confusion before she heard her mother’s footsteps in the hall and the sound of her voice but couldn’t make out what was being said. The young child shivered slightly as she looked over at her open window something she didn’t remember she had done her small legs draped over the side of her bed as she slid off. She walked over to her window and reached up with her small hands to close it silently not wanting to get in trouble for being awake since it was late in the evening.   The sudden scream from her mother caused Dakoda to flinch and jump spinning around quickly as she jerked her headphones off her head “Mommy?” Dakoda called out with fear tainting her tone she set her walkman and headphones down and walked out to the hallway just in time to see her father Javier running into her baby brother’s nursery as he called for her mother who had fallen unsettlingly quiet in the night air. Dakoda slowly crept along the wall to the doorway of her baby brother’s nursery and peeked her head in slightly “Dad?” she called out softly as he slowly turned his head towards the ceiling which in turn made Dakoda look up as well.   The sight of Lana Hernandez pinned to the ceiling with a bloody gash slashed across her abdomen filled Dakoda’s sight just before her mother burst into flames the six-year-old screamed for her mother and tried to run over only to be stopped by Javier who had snatched up baby Damien from his crib.   “Take your brother and run!” Javier commanded the six-year-old girl with a nudge towards the door Dakoda did as she was told and cradled her baby brother to her chest as she ran quickly to the door and down the stairs to the main entrance. Dakoda ran outside the house and turned to look at the nursery window as she walked onto the lawn she wasn’t given much time to look as Javier ran over and scooped up his children quickly as he ran towards where his parked car sat on the curb. Several emergency vehicles pulled up more than what their small town in Texas seemed to have. Dakoda kept a tight grip on her baby brother whom she still held in her small arms as Javier hadn’t taken him from her just yet he stared in numb shock at the house they had just been living in he lost his wife and his home in the same night.      A week after the fire     A SLEEK BLACK 1967 Chevrolet Impala had rolled into town the news of the mysterious fire had spread and caught the attention of one John Winchester with his boys Dean and Sam. The vehicle parked in front of one of the few motels that sat in the small town sitting towards the edge of town. The car parked alongside another sleek black vehicle a 1979 Ford Mustang that belonged to Javier Hernandez the small family of three didn’t have anywhere else to turn to so they’d been staying in the motel for the past week.   The now seven-year-old Dakoda peered out of the motel window her birthday had been a day prior but she hadn’t celebrated her father hadn’t even brought it up. The loss of the matriarch loomed over the small family the absence being felt stronger the more time passed by. Dakoda was left in charge of her baby brother Javier having been running around as he searched for answers. Javier hadn’t gotten in contact with John Winchester soon after the man had already heard about the fire the fires that killed their wives being done the same way wasn’t a coincidence.   Dakoda watched out of the motel room at the two young boys that stood beside their father as her own father spoke with them she ducked out of the window when the taller of the boys looked towards her. Footsteps were coming to the motel door before it opened to reveal her father leading the other trio inside Dakoda locked gazes with the older of the two boys dark brown meeting light green.   “Boys this is Dakoda and Damien.” John spoke first gesturing to the six-year-old with the infant gripped in her arms “Dakoda these are my sons. This is Dean” John gestured to the green-eyed boy “and this is Sam.” he finished as he gestured to the smaller boy. Dakoda gave a shy smile she hadn’t spoken since her mom died and she couldn’t find anything she could say to the boys. The two fathers continued speaking and stepped away from the four children Dakoda laid Damien into a crib Javier had bought while they stayed in the motel room. Dakoda watched as Dean directed Sam to one of the motel beds and made the younger boy take a nap since he was starting to doze off while standing.   Dakoda walked back over to the window and peered out her deep brown eyes holding a sadness that seemed unusual for a child to have but was natural since she lost her mother. Dean stepped up beside Dakoda and leaned against the wall beside the window.   “I lost my mom too.” Dean spoke after a long moment of silence his words breaking the ice between them “It was a while ago but I still miss her.”  “I miss my mom too.” Dakoda whispered the first words she’d spoken in a week and they had been said to the green-eyed boy she had just met.      Now - October 30th 2005     The smooth purring rumble of two classic vehicles raced down the long stretch of highway music blaring out of the windows of the lead car as it raced passed the other quickly. As the two vehicles approached an apartment building they slowed as the music was shut off and silence filled the air.   DAKODA HERNANDEZ stepped out of her 1979 Ford Mustang with a taunting smirk on her lips her gaze fixed on the 1967 Chevrolet Impala that pulled up beside her. She waited for the owner to step out before leaping onto his back the man releasing a resounding ‘oof!’ at the sudden presence of her added weight on his back.   “Told you I would win Dean should’ve listened.” Dakoda taunted lightly flicking the back of Dean’s ear as he carried her closer to the apartment building where their brothers lived.  “Yeah yeah Koda. Maybe I let you win.” Dean responded he hoisted her up his back to readjust his grip slightly his hands gripping the backs of her thighs comfortably.   “You wouldn’t you’d know I’d kick your ass.” Dakoda grinned as she leaned her chin on the green-eyed hunter’s shoulder “Are you even sure Damien and Sam will say yes Dean?” she asked after the fun had slightly died down.   “I’m sure Kody. I know for sure Damien will say yes you’re his big sister. We’ll have to see about Sam.” Dean replied his tone sounding hopeful at first but then becoming skeptical at the mention of Sam. The two approached the side of the building where the alleyway was standing just beneath the fire escape as Dakoda slid off Dean’s back. She watched as he jumped up and grabbed the bottom of the ladder before dragging it back down so they could climb onto it.  “You ready?” Dean asked raising his eyebrow at her with a small smile on his lips “Ready as I can be.” Dakoda responded.        a/n - the prologue ahhhh!! it’s finally up and I hope you like it! poor Koda. comment and let me know what you think! love you!     taglist - @dianawinchester03 @quarterhorse19  ( comment if you wish to be tagged )        © nesnejwritings  all rights reserved,2024-07-10 19:45:39 GMT

The first offender she catches is Sam who dog ears a spell book he’d been reading. Charlie appalled asks why he would do that and Sam tells her that he always just made due with what they had which since they were often in a car was usually nothing. She rants to Dean about his brother’s book care habits who tells her that he tends to just leave books open where he’s at pointing to a weathered ancient-looking tome which is currently lying pages down on the kitchen counter inches away from a pile of crumbs and definitely not helping the already deteriorating binding. She then decides to confront Cas. A being that’s had so much life experience must appreciate the efficiency and safety of a simple bookmark right? Cas quietly listens as Charlie lays out the damages that must have been inflicted on the Men of Letters collection. When she asks for his opinion he confidently tells her that he’s never damaged a book. Nor had he inserted any sort of marking he simply commits his current page and line to memory before putting it away. Charlie let’s her head fall against the table glad that although strange this method doesn’t harm the pages. She finally visits Jack who’s been in their room most of the day. They end up working together to craft a cup full of personalized bookmarks to keep in the library.,2024-07-10 19:05:40 GMT

DAKODA HERNANDEZ stepped out of her 1979 Ford Mustang with a taunting smirk on her lips her gaze fixed on the 1967 Chevrolet Impala that pulled up beside her. She waited for the owner to step out before leaping onto his back the man releasing a resounding ‘oof!’ at the sudden presence of her added weight on his back.   “Told you I would win Dean should’ve listened.” Dakoda taunted lightly flicking the back of Dean’s ear as he carried her closer to the apartment building where their brothers lived.  “Yeah yeah Koda. Maybe I let you win.” Dean responded he hoisted her up his back to readjust his grip slightly his hands gripping the backs of her thighs comfortably.   “You wouldn’t you’d know I’d kick your ass.” Dakoda grinned as she leaned her chin on the green-eyed hunter’s shoulder “Are you even sure Damien and Sam will say yes Dean?” she asked after the fun had slightly died down.   “I’m sure Kody. I know for sure Damien will say yes you’re his big sister. We’ll have to see about Sam.” Dean replied his tone sounding hopeful at first but then becoming skeptical at the mention of Sam. The two approached the side of the building where the alleyway was standing just beneath the fire escape as Dakoda slid off Dean’s back. She watched as he jumped up and grabbed the bottom of the ladder before dragging it back down so they could climb onto it.  “You ready?” Dean asked raising his eyebrow at her with a small smile on his lips “Ready as I can be.” Dakoda responded.        a/n - the prologue ahhhh!! it’s finally up and I hope you like it! poor Koda. comment and let me know what you think! love you!     taglist - @dianawinchester03 @quarterhorse19  ( comment if you wish to be tagged )        © nesnejwritings  all rights reserved,2024-07-10 19:45:39 GMT

One such chilling tale from Japan is the legend of the Kunkune a spectral entity that has captured the collective imagination and invoked a sense of dread among those who hear its story. This essay explores the origins characteristics and cultural significance of the Kunkune.     The Kunkune often depicted as a ghostly waving figure is said to appear in rural areas of Japan particularly in expansive rice fields. The name “Kunkune” itself is derived from the Japanese onomatopoeia “kunkun” which mimics the sound of something swaying or waving. This eerie figure is typically described as a white humanoid shape that oscillates in a hypnotic almost trance-inducing manner. Witnesses claim that the Kunkune can be seen from a distance often in the shimmering heat haze of summer adding an otherworldly quality to its already unsettling presence.     According to the legend the Kunkune is not just a benign apparition but a dangerous entity. Those who stare at it for too long or try to approach it are said to experience severe psychological distress madness or even death. The exact nature of the Kunkune’s malevolence varies among different retellings but the common thread is that it brings misfortune to those who dare to engage with it. This aspect of the legend serves as a cautionary tale warning individuals to respect the unknown and maintain a safe distance from things that are beyond human comprehension.     The cultural significance of the Kunkune lies in its embodiment of the fear of the unknown and the unseen. Japan has a rich tradition of ghost stories and supernatural folklore often rooted in Shinto and Buddhist beliefs that emphasize the presence of spirits and the thin veil between the physical and spiritual worlds. The Kunkune legend taps into these deeply ingrained cultural narratives reminding people of the potential dangers that lurk in liminal spaces—those areas that exist on the boundaries of the known world such as remote rice fields or the edges of human habitation.     Furthermore the Kunkune can be seen as a reflection of modern anxieties. In an increasingly urbanized and technologically advanced society the legend evokes a sense of nostalgia and fear associated with rural landscapes and traditional ways of life. It serves as a metaphor for the disconnection between modernity and nature highlighting the mysterious and often unsettling aspects of the natural world that remain beyond human control and understanding.     In conclusion the Japanese urban legend of the Kunkune is a compelling example of how folklore can encapsulate cultural fears and societal values. Through its eerie narrative and haunting imagery the Kunkune serves as a reminder of the enduring power of the unknown and the importance of respecting the boundaries between the seen and unseen. As with many urban legends the story of the Kunkune continues to evolve captivating new generations and preserving a unique aspect of Japanese cultural heritage.,2024-07-10 21:41:43 GMT

You felt intoxicated. You felt amazing.  Dean’s lips moved hot and fast against your own one hand of his sliding to grab the strands of your hair between his fingers and keep your mouth occupied the other moving to grab your waist and cage you in his arms against the rippling irresistible planes of muscle.   One hand of yours was tracing every dip and curve of his upper back while your other was carding through the wet strands of his hair. His shampoo conditioner and body wash acting as a drug - a stimulant - for your pressured mind.  A drug that you wouldn’t be arrested for.  You felt that muted haze dissipate and another replacing it. One more heated. Welcome. One that made your head spin and your lips collide with Dean’s over and over again that is until his lips veered off to burn a trail down your neck.  Your head tipping back to show the artist his canvas.  Open mouthed and reverent pressing onto your skin like claiming stamps gripping your hair to tilt you to his liking while his other hand groped and squeezed whatever he could reach. Feeling you up with possessive intent.  To claim you.   Make you his.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; His free hand slid to your ass massaging it kneading it in his strong fingers. Slapping it squeezing as if he was also depleting his own stress on top of yours.   “Jesus- fuck-” Was all you could get out under the present circumstance.   Now you weren’t usually turned on by an ass man but his ministrations had you moaning leaving red lines on Dean’s shoulders with your nails and a truly sinful sound rolling off his tongue.   “Fuck baby.” Dean growled nipping at your neck until there was a mark that could be covered easily by your blazer and not be a pain. What a gentleman.   Dean’s towel hit the floor and it was like a switch flipped in his brain when he used the grip he had on your ass to help grind you in a dizzying pace against his rapidly hardening cock this time around rather than his thigh.   Both felt like heaven. You were sure you’d be transported there once he was pounding into you.   However much the friction of your sleep shorts appealed to his dick Dean needed you out of those skimpy excuses for pyjamas. He took the hem of the sleep shorts and yanked them down until they pooled at your feet biting his lip as he fisted the hem of your shirt and whipped it off.   Oh. Oh.  On you was the goddamn sexiest black lace lingerie he’d ever seen. Sweet Jesus. The bra was just the right amount of sheer and framed you beautifully while the panties- good Lord if Dean started describing how perfect it was he wouldn’t be able to stop. Oh hail Mary and fuckin’ Joseph.  Didn’t help that he could see how soaked you were even from his position in front of you. The small grind he did as a test also confirmed it his teeth now worrying his bottom lip as he now no longer thought with his brain. His cock was sitting in the driver’s seat thank you very much.   And he was gonna have you hitch a ride.  “Fuck.” He cursed softly in comparison to the rough movements the moment before that had your nails grazing his scalp and bare upper back.   Dean gazed down at you licking his lips. His stare lit your cells on fire while his body language paired with the way he held you - hard and so damn possessive - enough to convince you that you were a five star five course meal that he was about to devour.   He’d be damned if he left any crumbs.   “You’ve ruined this sexy little number baby.” Dean murmured the backs of his fingers trailing down your side down down down until he gripped your thigh with a sure hand. A smirk tugging at his pouty kiss-swollen lips. “Don’t worry I’ll ruin your pretty pussy to match the set.”  You’d let out a gasp had it not been for Dean hitching your leg over his bare hip supporting you with his other hand on your lower back and lifting you effortlessly carrying you with a smooth motion over to the conveniently placed bed and almost slammed you down and before you knew it his lips were back on your neck. It was different than before. Less reverent less worshipping more feral.   As if the very feel of you had Dean’s pure instinct taking over.  Pure instinct had you arching into the hard ridges of his muscle baring your neck shamelessly your mouth falling open as the hand previously on your lower back rushed to keep himself upright by planting it firmly into the mattress beside your head. Dean’s other hand used the purchase on your thigh to grind down hard and heavy his breaths coming the same against your jugular as he bit at it sucking but not enough to leave a mark.   He did vow in his head that he’d only leave it where you could cover it. Couldn’t have the office asking questions.  “Dean…” You whined out in a voice that you could barely discern was yours your hand in his hair until you felt him take that hand off fabric sliding off your shoulders and skimpy lace being discarded carelessly off to some odd corner in the room. You couldn’t expect Dean to care where that thing went.  Dean took his thumb into his mouth swirling his tongue over it while he came back up to watch you you in your glory. Forget God he’d worship only you from now on cause damn were you a goddess.  You.  He let his thumb go with a slick pop trying to hold onto the last thread of his restraint as he took you in. You flushed panting your eyes slightly hazy from the intense sparks of heat he’d sent through you with a few hot brushes of his lips. His own defined chest heaving just as his eyes locked on your tits and- mhm.  That thread was cut fast.   His thumb made contact with one hardened nipple making your jaw go slack again and your hands fly to him again letting out a moan that would make a hooker blush. Rolling it over and over and over as he buried his face in between your tits so he could kiss the valley between them the underside and-  “Oh shit!” You cried out when Dean’s hot mouth closed around your nipple that damn talented tongue swirling around it before he sucked masterfully flicking the other in a way that had your hips attempting to lift to make contact with his again and he answered for you. Grinding down so you could feel every damn inch of what you did to him. What he’d been enduring five years ago and even now.  You were Dean’s drug. And when you weren’t there he had withdrawal symptoms. Serious withdrawal symptoms.  He sucked nibbled and licked sucked nibbled and licked until you were a moaning mess on the bed from the way his hand tweaked your other nipple and how his cock felt against your clothed pussy.   God Dean could do this all day. Give him a chance and he would.  You never noticed when his hand left your other nipple never noticed when your soaked panties left your body and were tossed aside never noticed until you felt him dragging his fingers over your cunt and to your clit the sharp but needy sound from you making him grin devilishly into your skin.   Dean popped up licking his lips and then chuckling. “Got so much pressure built up dontcha sweetheart? Want someone to release it for you dontcha?” He heard a needy whine and plea for him to ‘not stop’ which had him clicking his tongue.  “Oh baby.” He purred rubbing his thumb on your clit. The calloused pad having shocks of pure welcomed electricity through the tips of your fingers to your brain and down back to your cunt. “That little session we had in my office ain’t enough for you is it? Needy little thing.”  No thoughts. Pussy in charge.  It was definitely in charge when he thrusted two thick fingers into you demanding and possessive and- fuck that’s good. Your hips bucked into the touch another moan leaving your mouth that really had you questioning if you knew your own voice; it sounded so shameless and needy and wanting.  It sounded good. It felt even better.  You didn’t care that Dean was your colleague the one rule you’d had for five years smashed with a sledgehammer because no you didn’t care anymore. You couldn’t bring yourself to care not when his fingers were pumping in and out of you working you making your back arch and hips rocking to meet his ministrations. Yep you knew he could play you like a fine tuned violin and god was he doing that.  He crooked his fingers just right an “oh fuck!” leaving your mouth and moans in quick succession as his tongue laved at the nipple his mouth had neglected which did not help you to think straight. It had you clenching around his fingers the pads of them hitting your g-spot deliciously instead.   Adding another finger and doing it again.  “Shit sweetheart.” Dean growled against your skin licking over your nipple as well. Looks like he was a tits man as well with how eagerly he was worshipping them. “Squeezin’ my fingers so tight. This pussy’s so tight- you sure it can fit my cock? Shit- fuck.” He groaned as you clamped down on him again at the syncing of his fingers against your g-spot and his thumb rubbing at your clit. You were about to drive him insane.  “Dean” You took a moment to breathe your head falling back as you tried to get your bearings. You failed but ah well another day. “Mmh s’close. Gonna come. M’gonna come.”   “That right baby?” Dean chuckled sucking a mark in the valley of your tits. Hey you had absolutely no problem with that. “Gonna come for me? Come so pretty for me?” He bit his lip and then licked them at the sight of you nodding and writhing on the bed your hips meeting the movements while he made a mess of you with his mouth on your tits and his fingers buried knuckle deep inside you. His mouth moving to hover by your ear teeth teasing your earlobe. “Go on. Wanna hear my name when you do it. When you release all that tension that’s had you bitchin’ all this time. Just needed me didn’t you sweetheart?”  The words so dirty and filthy. His breath hot and searing. Teeth skilled and precise.   It was like Dean had been rehearsing for this moment. Got the perfect cadence of his gravelly voice just for you. The perfect rhythm of his fingers just for you. Just for you so they would have you coming - eyes rolling back jaw slack hips stuttering and thighs twitching sweat beading at your temple as your foot propped on the bed and curled the best they could into the grey satin sheets - just like you were right now.  Oh dear.  Oh Lord.  Oh fuck-   You could barely fathom after your first orgasm of the night what would happen next but you found out right when Dean got further down the bed and pulled his fingers out of you getting a taste of you and moaning at it. You were ambrosia in human goddamn form.   Before you could adjust he licked a long stripe up your soaking cunt lapping and getting all of you on his tongue the sweet flavour flooding his taste buds and dimming everything in the room but you. You. You-  My god this wasn’t enough.  Within seconds Dean manoeuvred you both so he was flat on his back head pushed back against the pillows nestling your thighs on either side of his head. You looked down at him from your position hand flying to grip the headboard just as he grinned up at you from beneath you your pussy right there for him to devour. Where he felt like he belonged.  Dean looked like sex. Hell he probably was sex.  Without a word Dean rubbed up and down your thighs feeling the softness in his palms before he seized your hips pulling you flush against his face and beginning to- oh God shit fuck hail Jesus and Mary and Joseph and all of Nazareth.  Fuck.  “Dean- oh Dean- Dean!” Your brain was short circuiting. Your eyes were rolling back. Hand gripping the headboard so tight your knuckles went white. Your other hand finding your hair and gripping it tight as your mouth fell open and let out a string of expletives adorned with his goddamn name.  Dean was devouring you. Lapping at your pussy sucking drinking you dry like you were his first meal in so long. His tongue sliding over your cunt before pushing in once twice thrice before slipping out and repeating the rapid strokes. And then a harsh suck on your clit just to get you to your limit that much faster. To get you to whine moan whimper - anything - his name.   That’s what his shit-eating grin was for as he got his lips and chin messy eating the living daylights out of you.  He groaned out something about you tasting like heaven but you didn’t hear instead focused on chasing your orgasm while your hips mindlessly ground against his face. He slapped your thigh in response but when you stilled obediently - thinking he wanted you to stop - no he took your hips in an almost bruising grip and did the work for you. Rolling your hips down to meet every suck and lap of his until you were shaking again falling over the edge again to the rhythm and play of his tongue sliding over your pussy.  Once he’d gotten that second fill of you he hitched himself up so he sat with his back to the plush velvet headboard so you could see him after he’d wrecked you for the second time around- going on a third at this rate.   His lips were glistening and his chin the same state pupils blown wide as he panted and grinned at you like the pure goddamn sex he was.  “Fuckin’ beautiful sweetheart.” Dean muttered before he cupped your jaw and drew you into a searing kiss so that you could taste yourself on his tongue. Taste yourself while he gave you the most sloppy filthy sinful perfect kiss of your life.  Don’t tell him you said that.  With a bite of his lip a checking out of your body and a quick slap to your ass he took a hold of you and rolled you over pinning one hand above your head by entwining your fingers with his own and keeping them there.  “Ready sweetheart?” Dean smirked spreading your legs and in turn spreading you open. He caught sight of your dripping cunt and he felt a swell of pride that he made you feel that good. That he forewent his own pleasure (he only realised how much his cock ached for you round about now he was that focused on you) to take care of you.  He was about to smirk out another sentence but then he was cut off by a groan caused by your hand on his cock rubbing your thumb over his slit and spreading the pre-come before using it to pump your hand up and down. Dean could have spent forever with you jacking him off but he stopped you panting.   “Sorry baby but if you continue like that m’gonna embarrass myself.” He chuckled tearing a condom packet with his teeth and rolling the rubber on. “Need to be inside you. You ready?” When he didn’t get a response he slapped your thigh- which got a squeak from you. “Words sweetheart. I need words.”  You nodded frantically panting. “Yes yes I’m ready please I’m ready-” You let out a broken moan when Dean thrusted roughly unto you and god the pace was bruising but felt… so. Damn. Good.  Dean’s thrusts were rough but deep. Purposeful. As if every move was calculated. He had gripped the velvet headboard in his free hand until he went the extra mile changing the angle by hitching your leg over his hip his eyes rolling back when your heel pressed against his lower back and had him magnifying the feeling of you wrapped around him so deliciously tenfold.  “So fuckin’ tight baby.” He groaned his head dropping to your shoulder as his hips snapped forward the bed creaking under the force. His teeth nipped at the skin the hand holding your thigh securing your leg over your hip before placing his hand on your throat; not squeezing just letting you know that it was there.  And by the way you moaned and your head fell back you enjoyed it. Damn Dean never knew you were freaky.  He loved it.  With a few rough snaps he felt himself suddenly fall over the edge spilling into the condom with a low guttural moan. Even so he sloppily thrust into you a few more times to have you going down with him your lips meeting in a filthy desperate kiss.  Now you’d have thought three mind blowing orgasms would be enough for you but it didn’t seem close to enough once Dean rolled you both over seizing your hips and making you ride him. At first it was him lifting you to the head of his dick and lowering you until you sheathed him completely but then it was all you you you.  “Dean” Was all you could say as you set a steady rhythm your nails raking down his chest and leaving red trails and crescent marks. Those had him chuckling and nodding in approval.  “That’s right good girl. Mark me up.” Dean grunted softly gripping your hips tighter the vein in his neck popping for an extremely good reason as his head fell back against the pillows. “Ride my cock baby. Look so good bouncin’ like that. Fuck never stop. Could see you like this all day. Shit sweetheart.”   You took gasping breaths trying to reduce the embarrassing amount of moans leaving your mouth your pussy clenching tight around Dean and letting him know you were close. His hands slid to your ass kneading and rolling the softness in his hands propping himself up to suck and lick at your nipples which got you there that much faster. Didn’t help when his thumb found your clit.  Rubbing. Flicking. Ruining you.  Damn he knew exactly what he was doing. Because now your eyes could only see stars and you were coming on his cock him following you about five thrusts later with a loud and choked moan. You could have almost collapsed forward had it not been for Dean holding you up and the next thing you knew you were both breathlessly chuckling.  “Well that’s a way to uh let out the stress.” You breathed biting your lip and running a hand through your sweaty hair. “Carajo.”  “Damn straight.” Dean laughed pulling you off his cock gently and laying you down next to him. “I’ll give it to you sweetheart you are one damn good fuck.”  “We just…” Fuck. “We just fucked.”  “Yeah we did. Objections?”  “Dean this is what I’ve been avoiding. Sure we torched the Code of Conduct by making out in your office but now I’m pretty sure it’s disintegrated.” You sighed the growing throb in your pussy from being pounded into by Dean Winchester beginning to take over. Yep you’d be walking funny. “It’s not a mistake I participated with sound mind body and soul but I just…”  Dean understood. “You’re confused.”  “Yeah.” You nodded biting your lip. “And with everything that’s going on I’m not even sure that getting in a relationship - let alone with you - is a wise option. I’d just be a shitty girlfriend.”  “Sweetheart I don’t want you downplaying yourself like that again you hear me?” Dean said sternly his jaw set looking the picture of perfection and porn with his skin shiny from the water and sex induced sweat the remnants of bliss clinging to his gorgeous features cheeks still carrying a slightly rosy tinge. Not to mention how his lips and chin still shone with the sweetness he’d tasted eagerly on his tongue the moment before. “I’m not gonna judge you for wanting to take it slow. Especially when we got crime Lords out there.”  Beat.  “But if you need some assistance in satisfying that gorgeous pussy then I’m one text away.”  Shit. You needed a round two stat.  The White House. What a place for pretentious politicians.  “Mr President you have a meeting with the Russian Ambassador at four and the British Ambassador at six.” Chuck Shurley’s assistant Becky Rosen read off a tablet while President Shurley himself was looking at himself in the mirror to check if he was wearing the right suit for his next press conference.  “So many ambassadors.” Chuck muttered under his breath as he took off his blazer to exchange a tie for another one. “Look Becky can you be a dear and move my six o’clock to three tomorrow? My days’s too swamped and you know the Russians they’re probably going to take up most of my time.”  Becky nodded eagerly tapping on her keyboard. “I can do that sir let me put in a phone call.” Then there was chatter on her earpiece and she let out a small “oh!” of surprise. “You have a visitor Mr President.”  “And who’s that Becky?” Chuck turned around with two ties each in his hand. He took a look at the four and put two back in the drawer examining the other two.  “Your sister sir. Amara.”  That piqued Chuck’s interest. “Yes I know who my sister is. Send her in and you leave.”  Becky nodded already beginning to leave. “Of course sir.”   The door shut behind her and while Chuck was busy trying to figure out which tie worked best with his slacks the door opened and closed in coming Chuck’s sister.  Amara Shurley. Sister of the President and the First Lady since Chuck had no game.   Her black dress swished and her heels thudded against the soft carpet as she looked out upon the massive crowd and array of cameras waiting for Chuck’s statement on the recent leak of there being a crime lord called Asmodeus out wreaking havoc in America. “What will you say to them?”  “Anything.” He turned around with a soft sigh. “Those people out there just want reassurance. They’re willing to believe any lie even if it’s on some cue cards that they can’t see on my podium.”  Amara frowned slowly fiddling with her hands. “So what was that policeman? Nick Santiago? Was what you said strictly for reassurance?”  “Of course not.” Chuck scoffed shaking his head as he examined the ties. “I wouldn’t be in this office had it not been for that police sergeant. I wrote that bit of speech myself. I have to give myself some credit for that. I could be a writer if I hadn’t become President.” Chuck laughed slightly then turned to Amara holding up the ties that had made the cut. One navy diagonally striped red and another that was plain navy. “Which one? Can’t choose.”  “Plain.” Amara replied simply and almost curtly pacing. “You need to play this smart. Some criminals are out for your blood and there will come a time where your security detail isn’t as good as you think they’ll be. My advice is to tell everyone the truth.”  Chuck spun around vigorously doing the tie in barely restrained shock. “The truth?!” He burst out shaking his head and pointing out of the window to the masses of people oblivious people. “Those people will go insane if I tell them the truth. That there’s a high profile crime syndicate out to kill me and possibly a large section of the population with their large-scale attacks. I’ve been briefed by the Major Crimes unit’s director at the FBI. There are dangerous individuals out there who haven’t been properly identified. If I tell all that to the public America descends into chaos and I lose my position as the President.”  “So… you’ll lie.”  “Politicians lie Amara.” Chuck snapped putting his suit jacket on and beginning the last finishing touches to his hair. “I’m a politician. I lie. It’s how people like me get by in this train wreck of a country!”   “And I’m one of the only civilians that aren’t left in the dark.” Amara muttered dejected. “Fine Chuck. But know that if this goes downhill I warned you.” Amara turned on her high heel leaving the room promptly.  Chuck rubbed his forehead smoothing out the creases but he didn’t have time to worry over an argument with his sister. He put on his cuff links checked that every strand of his hair was perfectly set then stepped out of his room and met his bodyguards.   “Carlson.” He muttered to one of the guards who nodded back.  “Mr President.” Carlson replied curtly looking forward with an earpiece attached to a wire that disappeared down the front of his suit jacket.  Time to lie again.  “Alright every agent involved has to be on the clock and alert y’hear?” Director Singer informed all of us. We’d gotten word from our contacts undercover in crime rings that the syndicate dubbed ‘Hell’ was going to make their move on the British consulate. Tonight at a meeting in the British Embassy. It was Agent Lafitte Agent Garrison (who had been taken off suspension) and S. Winchester’s job to secure the perimeter.   As for Dean and I we’d been assigned a full sweep of the building with some MI6 agents on the case to protect the British consulate: Agent Mick Davies and Agent Arthur Ketch. Neither you nor Dean looked forward to be meeting with the Brits but hey it was your job.  “You two” Director Singer gestured between the two of you “everything needs to go smoothly with these MI6 agents. I don’t want any reports to come back from their supervisor. Winchester I’m lookin’ at you.” He pointedly stared at Dean who returned the glare with a deceivingly innocent expression. “They’ll meet you in T minus five minutes.”  Beat.  “What’s everyone waiting for? Go go go!”  Everyone split off and you and Dean were left alone and he shot you a sideways smile. “So… Sam knows.”  “Yep.” You nodded sighing. “Andréa knows as well.”  “Damn.” Dean whistled lowly folding his arms and giving you a sideways look. At least it wasn’t the usual searing looks that had your mind going places. It was more muted probably from the previous day’s intense release(s) of the day before.   You didn’t know whether to call it a mistake or the best damn night of your life. You had to admit relinquishing control letting Dean put you under him and hearing him talk dirty with that deep voice into your ear was heaven and hell on earth. But when he rolled you over and set you above him you felt almost powerful.  So you didn’t know what to think. All you knew is that you and Dean Winchester in the same room was a recipe for disaster. Because it always ended in hardcore sex.  Or even hardcore making out. Anything with the term hardcore would do.  “You the FBI associates?” Two men walked up to the two of you. One short and frankly dressed in the least stylish suit you’d seen. He gave you the impression of an extremely off brand Patrick Dempsey. He put his hand out to Dean with a polite smile eyes scanning the both of you. “Mick Davies MI6.”  “Dean Winchester FBI.” Dean replied shaking Mick’s hand and with the small flinch in Mick’s expression Dean had pulled out the ‘hell of a grip’ move due to the inflation in testosterone.  Davies’ associate however was taller and he looked like he permanently had a bad smell under his nose. That is until he saw you. That was when he put on a rather ‘pretentious dick’ smile and extended his hand to you. “Arthur Ketch.” His eyes had a glint in them that you didn’t trust. “MI6.”  “Nice to meet you.” You said curtly then cleared your throat. “Our work is to protect the Consulate. Our agents are securing a perimeter as we speak. We need airtight security and airtight security detail. That means no distractions and all eyes on any suspicious figures in the room.”  Dean had a feeling the ‘no distractions’ bit was very aimed at him. Knowing you it probably was.  “We have it covered darling.” Ketch flashed you what he thought must have been a charming smile but instead looked constipated. “You hang tight.”  “I’m not ‘hanging tight’.” You responded with a hint of frost to your words. Who were you kidding? That frost was as strong as a tequila shot. “I’m doing my job. Do yours as well.” You walked off adjusting the straps of your FBI vest going to Director Singer to check if the perimeter was secure.  One thing. Can one thing in your life go right?  “Harvelle what do you mean by ‘the files are scattered’?” You hissed into your phone trying to watch the room but also dealing with a problem back at the office.  ‘That’s the literal term.’ Jo almost winced as she seemed to be collecting all the files. ‘Somebody broke into the office and searched through.’  “Ok.” You took a breath so you wouldn’t spontaneously combust and fantasise about Dean taking care of you again. “Right. Here’s what you need to do. Sort the files get Tran to help and run all the collected files and its contents through our database. If anyone’s taken anything we know it’s a class one priority. You report to me tell me what’s missing. Any evidence that’s been tampered with report to me. Got it?”  ‘Yeah.’  “Now I have a Consulate to watch. Bye.”  ‘Bye.’ Harvelle squeaked and cut the call. You sighed rubbing your forehead. Nope. Nothing could go right.  Dean walked through the halls radio up to his mouth as he gave orders and updates on the situation. He passed a large group of people and as he did a very discreet movement with made. Using a sharpened pocketknife with one clean flick of the knife they cut the side of Dean’s bulletproof vest. If by chance he made one wrong move he was exposed.  While Consulate Sutherland of Britain was shaking hands with the mayor of Washington Vince Gray you were approached by a lady asking for the bathroom. She seemed innocent enough then you saw it. White suit slicked back salt and pepper hair raising a pistol.  Asmodeus.  The lady was a distraction.  You quickly cuffed her and handed her over to Agent Lafitte running but you didn’t think you’d get there fast enough. “GET DOWN!”  Dean saw your sprinting and he got there before you diving to tackle the Consulate and mayor down but his cut vest ripped and the bullet that was fired with a deafening bang struck him in the side.  Your steps faltered for a moment especially as you saw the supposed ‘distraction’ raise a small-duty detonator. You snapped the fastenings on the metal table flipping it. You heard her make the cry “For Azazel!” before a much smaller blast than the one at the President’s speech ripped through the building pushing you back and replacing all sense of sound with high white noise in your ear.  It was deafening blocking out all sound but your eyes were in full working order. Asmodeus raised his gun again and that prompted you to quickly flip the table in front of you just as the bullets flew making dents in the metal from your side. Reaching for your handgun you cocked it and flipped the safety Dean saying something that you couldn’t make out through the ringing in your ears instead popping up from behind the table to fire a shot before ducking back down.  “Sweetheart.” You could make out from under the ringing alone with Dean’s hand clutching his side compressing the blood flow.  You couldn’t hear a thing looking blank even as you kept shooting at irregular intervals only able to remain up for a short amount of time which sent your aim off kilter a bit. Didn’t help that Asmodeus was surprisingly agile for a man that seemed to be older.   You fired a quick and precise shot having regained your bearings a bit hitting the gun from a diagonal and sending it skidding which forced Asmodeus to run. You could have run after him. However as you’d recovered you nodded to Dean. “Yeah?”  “The mole.” Dean panted holding his hand to his side. “Probably compromised our position. You need to go get ‘em sweetheart.” He grunted unable to move much. You were torn between staying and leaving but he chuckled. “I can see the cogs. Go. Now.”  Your job’s duty was right there with the rapidly retreating figure of Asmodeus. But it was also with protecting your colleague so you took off your jacket gesturing for Sam to move in on Asmodeus and begin chase while Benny Cas Meg and Ruby headed to secure a tighter perimeter.  Rolling up your sleeves you took a look at Dean gently removing his hands and checking for his signs of consciousness. “You’re gonna have to keep talking ok?” You paused and then chuckled. “As if you had any trouble with that before.”  The comment got a laugh and a shake of Dean’s head huffing. “Smartass.” He coughed slightly. “I’ll fuck that attitude out of you when m’healed up.”  “Trust me counting on it.” You grinned. Even if you weren’t sure if that would happen again. You pressed your hand firmly over the wound quickly calling for medical backup and checking it over. “No major arteries. But this needs to be checked out Dean. I’m not leaving you.”  “Yes you are.” Dean insisted reaching up to tuck a strand of hair behind your ear. “You’re better kickin’ ass instead of checkin’ on me.”  “Are you sure?”  “Yes.”  “Double sure?”  “Double yes.”  “Dean.”  “I’m not hearing this.” He lightly shoved your shoulder. “Go on get.”  “Classy.” You sighed replacing the clip of your gun and cocking the barrel. But you conceded sighing. “Fine. Fine. I’m going.”  “Good girl.” Dean murmured cradling your jaw. “Give ‘em hell darlin’.” You nodded then ran after Asmodeus leaving Dean alone as he saw paramedics pull up outside.   “Son of a bitch.” He grunted looking at the scarlet on his fingers.  In the meantime you sprinted down where you thought Asmodeus went but found nothing. Nothing except a dragged trail of red which you followed.   The streaks of red on the stone floor ended at feet. Which were obviously connected to legs and then hips and a torso and a… neck. Oh God.  The guy you’d found was deader than dead. His throat was slit deep and almost surgically blood dripping steadily into a puddle on the ground.   And over the cleverly painted mural above the poor dead civilian were words painted in blood. Hasty and hurried words.   I WARNED YOU.  NEXT UP: “My baby.” Your mom whispered sitting beside you in your hospital bed smoothing back your hair. “God look at you.”  You rolled your eyes prepared for the worst. After all nothing more or less could be expected of your traditional mother other than and personal comments to your appearance.   “Spit it out.” You groaned. “I look like hell.” You felt like you’d combust. You’d do it. Fragile chine be damned.  Like comment or reblog! I’d love to hear your feedback. Comment if you want to be added to the taglist.

The idea that keeps pestering me is that when Sam went to collage dean took the impala and went in a bit of a bender until baby drive him to the N.E.S.T base and dumped him on the tarmac and transformed. Dean still slightly drunk pulls out his pistol and starts shooting and screaming thinking something has possessed his poor car. Baby slowly kneels down and cups her hands around her favorite human and softly coos at him until he calms down. This leads to dean winchester becoming a member of the N.E.S.T staff along with Sam whitwicky and Lennox. He and baby who’s real designation is nightspark drive around the country hunting the supernatural and extraterrestrial. When John goes missing dean collects Sam as usual and the first season pans about almost exactly as the show. But before the boys meet back up with John for the finale few episodes dean gets called back to N.E.S.T so he packs his bags and leaves Sam at a bus stop and dean gets shipped out to Egypt. Dean gets killed alongside Sam whitwicky but they both are deamed worthy by the primes Sam whitwicky as a prime and dean as a lord high protector. Dean gets to spend some time in the hospital getting scanned and debreafed as baby gets her injuries seen to. They return to the states and find Sam who baby put a tracker on the finally plays out as in the show and baby does incur major damage but gets out a distress signal to the autobots and N.E.S.T so that when Sam and John wake up they are greeted by tons of military personnel who are fighting to gain custody of dean and the others involved in the wreck dew to potential energon exposer. At least that’s what they tell them so John never makes a deal Sam ends up working with the N.E.S.T leagal team and finish’s his degree and baby takes John out to a cliff and kicks him off it.￼  Let me know if you want to hear more I think this one’s a little long.,2024-07-10 22:37:14 GMT

So basically Sloane is helping Ferris with the waiter who wouldn’t welcome him in the restaurant. Just like Dean is “helping” (it’s all in his head lol) Cas with Mandy the waitress.

One such chilling tale from Japan is the legend of the Kunkune a spectral entity that has captured the collective imagination and invoked a sense of dread among those who hear its story. This essay explores the origins characteristics and cultural significance of the Kunkune.     The Kunkune often depicted as a ghostly waving figure is said to appear in rural areas of Japan particularly in expansive rice fields. The name “Kunkune” itself is derived from the Japanese onomatopoeia “kunkun” which mimics the sound of something swaying or waving. This eerie figure is typically described as a white humanoid shape that oscillates in a hypnotic almost trance-inducing manner. Witnesses claim that the Kunkune can be seen from a distance often in the shimmering heat haze of summer adding an otherworldly quality to its already unsettling presence.     According to the legend the Kunkune is not just a benign apparition but a dangerous entity. Those who stare at it for too long or try to approach it are said to experience severe psychological distress madness or even death. The exact nature of the Kunkune’s malevolence varies among different retellings but the common thread is that it brings misfortune to those who dare to engage with it. This aspect of the legend serves as a cautionary tale warning individuals to respect the unknown and maintain a safe distance from things that are beyond human comprehension.     The cultural significance of the Kunkune lies in its embodiment of the fear of the unknown and the unseen. Japan has a rich tradition of ghost stories and supernatural folklore often rooted in Shinto and Buddhist beliefs that emphasize the presence of spirits and the thin veil between the physical and spiritual worlds. The Kunkune legend taps into these deeply ingrained cultural narratives reminding people of the potential dangers that lurk in liminal spaces—those areas that exist on the boundaries of the known world such as remote rice fields or the edges of human habitation.     Furthermore the Kunkune can be seen as a reflection of modern anxieties. In an increasingly urbanized and technologically advanced society the legend evokes a sense of nostalgia and fear associated with rural landscapes and traditional ways of life. It serves as a metaphor for the disconnection between modernity and nature highlighting the mysterious and often unsettling aspects of the natural world that remain beyond human control and understanding.     In conclusion the Japanese urban legend of the Kunkune is a compelling example of how folklore can encapsulate cultural fears and societal values. Through its eerie narrative and haunting imagery the Kunkune serves as a reminder of the enduring power of the unknown and the importance of respecting the boundaries between the seen and unseen. As with many urban legends the story of the Kunkune continues to evolve captivating new generations and preserving a unique aspect of Japanese cultural heritage.,2024-07-10 21:41:43 GMT

13,Supernatural,['spn'  'spn writers'  'spn producers'  'meta'  'mine'],italwayshadtobeyou,One of the things that I kind of miss as the show’s lore develops into the era of bunkers and international secret societies is the fragmented nature of knowledge in the hunting… well I was going to say community but I think I’ll go with field. People pass knowledge along family lines by blood or choice; they don’t trust strangers to fact-check it. None of the Winchesters knows that vampires are real before season 1 and they don’t think to ask Bobby about the werewolf “cure” until it fails on Madison. Bobby doesn’t trust Steve Wandell’s friends to care that Sam was possessed when Meg used him to kill Steve. Ellen doesn’t trust most of her customer base to not be hunting psychics. Isaac assumes on minimal grounds that Bobby Sam and Dean are at fault for a devil’s gate opening. Walt and Roy try to kill Sam for freeing Lucifer but they don’t try– in fact outright refuse– to learn how it happened. Hunters aren’t a single group; they’re more like dozens of small paramilitaries that don’t really know one another’s agendas.  And when hunters do trust outside colleagues it’s likelier than not to go sideways. Gordon Walker tries to kill Sam (although in fairness to Gordon Sam himself later wonders if a permanent death might be for the best). Travis (does he get a last name? I can’t remember) not only tries to kill a rugaru who hasn’t yet killed any humans; his own aggression catalyzes Jack Montgomery’s transformation and nearly gets both brothers killed. Sam asks Martin to do recon on Benny and Martin winds up taking an innocent hostage so that he can trap Benny himself. Helpful or at least well-meaning hunters like Bobby Jo and Garth are until some point in the Carver era exceptions rather than the rule.  (Of course if you pay attention to the single worst arc episode of the series which is “The Heroes’ Journey” Garth turns out to be the biggest psycho of them all cheerfully “Garthing” a whole club of people without attempting to separate the innocent from the guilty. But since that’s easily the worst episode Andrew Dabb ever wrote and it drops another continuity error approximately every three seconds I’m electing to ignore it.)  I’m not sure exactly when the change starts. It’s creeping rather than sudden. Maybe it starts as far back as season 4’s “In the Beginning” when Samuel tests Dean’s bona fides by asking him about vampires– which “Dead Man’s Blood” made clear you can hunt a long time without encountering. Maybe inheriting Bobby’s contacts list has something to do with it. Maybe once you call a friendly tech friend like Charlie a hunter you forget what cold-blooded sons of bitches this show’s regular hunters have usually been. You can see the difference in season 9’s “Devil May Care” where Tracy makes snide comments about Sam’s past but puts it aside to work their case and season 11’s “The Chitters” where Sam and Dean have a low-drama teamup with César and Jesse. Then you have season 12’s “Celebrating the Life of Asa Fox” where dozens of hunters gather for a wake in a late hunter’s mom’s house and one guy actually fanboys over Sam’s possession by Lucifer. Some of these experiences are tense but they aren’t downright threatening nor are the other hunters all useless against higher-tier opponents.  So what changed? I’d say that maybe the apocalypse and Leviathan killed off the dangerously ignorant and/or belligerent hunters but Walt and Roy show back up in season 12 so that seems doubtful. I might also say that the Winchesters have simply earned the trust and respect of their fellow hunters but LOL no. Remember Dean’s friend Rudy and Mary’s stooge that Ramiel kills?  I’m left with no good Watsonian explanation. I can give Doylist explanations sure: Maybe the writers wanted Mary to have associates outside of Sam and Dean; maybe some executive thought that a show about two rejects wouldn’t attract the advertisers they wanted; maybe later-seasons showrunners wanted an excuse for more characters to share a room. Unfortunately Doylist explanations don’t interest me much. They might if I could be a fly on the wall of the writers’ room but I’m watching the final product and that’s where I want to find the sense.  (As a final note I’m still slightly doped up from a minor surgery earlier today so please forgive any egregious typos or jumps in topics.),2024-07-11 00:12:02 GMT

Mechanic Dean x Reader  Chapter Summary: Andrew isn’t happy with Y/N and Dean sees something he wished he didn’t.  Warnings: Mentions of domestic assault physical abuse threatening panic angst.  Series Masterlist here!! &amp; Main masterlist here!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; The next morning I woke up feeling surprisingly refreshed despite the drama of the previous day. There was a faint glimmer of hope in my heart perhaps sparked by Dean the man I’d met. Yet I couldn’t ignore the reality: I hardly knew him.   Why was I so eager to see him again?  My plans were clear: get my car fixed leave town with whatever money I had left avoid Andrew and his lies and start fresh. Oddly the thought of not seeing Dean after my car was fixed stung a bit why was I going to miss him?  After getting ready I headed to the bank and withdrew my remaining money closed my account and opened a new one to prevent Andrew from accessing my funds again. It was a small victory but it felt like progress.  Next stop was the coffee shop I went to every morning trying to get back into my routine before I left for good. Sitting at the bar I ordered breakfast trying to ignore the curious glances I recieved. Why did they look at me like they knew something? Did Andrew spread lies here too?  The waitress came by and instead of greeting me normally she stood by the counter her eyes narrowing down at me.  “Listen… I don’t know what you heard about me but..”  She quickly cut me short leaning closer to me. “Listen people aren’t comfortable with you being here. From what we heard from Andrew it’s best if you don’t come back.  My heart raced ears blocked and I struggled to breathe as the panic rose. &quot;With all due respect you don’t have the full story.” I managed to say quietly.  She chuckled softly “We all know Andrew. He’s the friendliest guy around.”  I nodded looking away. “And what have you heard about me?”  “We heard you used him got tired of playing second fiddle acted out for attention. Issues with drinking violence… then you took his money and disappeared. Now you’re back to torment him.”  I froze tears welling up. Why was Andrew spreading these lies to isolate me? “That’s not true at all. He hurt me. I could take off my makeup and show you. Andrew is not a nice guy and even though he seems like it he has darkness inside of him.”  She rolled her eyes and scoffed“Look I’m not trying to cause a scene but I think it’s best if you just leave.”  Nodding I got up from my seat and left. I couldn’t handle the fact that he was right nobody was ever going to believe me.   Back at the motel I saw Dean’s truck outside and my heart stopped momentarily. I quickly wiped my eyes and tried to compose myself before walking closer he didn’t need to see me cry. He probably wouldn’t even care nobody cared they just wanted me gone.  Has Dean heard these rumours?  He smiled warmly until I stepped closer noticing the redness in my eyes. “Y/N? You okay?”   “Yeah I’m fine.” I replied unconvincingly. His lingering gaze suggested he saw through my facade but I pushed my head down eyes focusing on my boots.   “Uh so your car’s ready. Four new tires” he said trying to distract me.  “Thank you. How much?” I questioned trying to hide the anxiety at whatever number he was about to drop.  Dean hesitated a small shy smile spreading on his lips. “Instead of payment I was wondering if I could I get your number?”  My breath caught in my throat as i stared up at him “What?”  His cheeks flushed with embarrassment a nervous smile playing at his lips. “Sorry that was forward. I meant I don’t need you to pay me back. I just thought maybe we could grab some dinner sometime?”  I urged myself to respond but no words came out. My mouth opened but before I could speak Andrew’s voice cut through causing me to flinch. He approached angrily distrupting the moment. “Y/N can I speak with you?”  I faced Dean smiling nervously. “I-I’m sorry I have to go..”  Dean looked puzzled but stayed put watching cautiously as Andrew closed in on me. Fear gripped me. I wanted to hide behind Dean but I couldn’t burden a stranger with my troubles.  Andrew closed the distance flashing his fake smile and standing beside Dean and I. “Andrew Wilson nice to meet you.”  “Uh Dean Winchester. Nice to meet you too.”  Andrew stopped a wide grin spreading across his face as he tried to win Dean’s favour. “Winchester like Winchester mechanics?”  Dean nodded in response.   “Wow small world. I was going to call John for an interview tomorrow. How cool is that?”  I knew Andrew was trying to manipulate Dean and he seemed to sense it too. “Anyways I need to talk to Y/N for a minute. Afterward she can settle the bill with you.”  Dean glanced at me noticing my fear and perhaps the bruises beneath my makeup. He nodded and settled back in his truck keeping an eye on us. He couldn’t ignore the tight grip of Andrew’s hand on my arm or the tremors of fear coursing through my body.   He wished he could intervine to punch Andrew and pull me from the scene but he knew it wasn’t his fight-at least not yet. He barely knew me; stepping in now might complicate things further.  But as Andrew led me forcefully toward the motel room Dean’s cheeks burned with anger and worry. He sensed trouble brewing a sinking feeling that something was very wrong.  Stepping out of his truck Dean leaned against the wall the sound of screaming filling his ears and shattering his heart.  Andrew’s voice was furious accusing me of lying and staining his reputation. He advanced on me aggressively trapping me against the wall. The punch he aimed at the wall beside me made tears well up-I knew he intended to hurt me again.  “You’re a fucking bitch.” Andrew spat his face twisted with rage. “Telling your stupid fucking lies. Tomorrow you’re going back and telling everybody you were drunk and you lied.”  “N-No.” I stammered fear gripping me as he pressed closer his hand on my cheek. “I’m not going to.”  He laughed bitterly his eyes threatening. “You will or I’ll drag you there myself. I can make your life hell believe me.”  “Get off me Andrew!” I pleaded desperation creeping into my voice.  He laughed again his hand tightening on my face. Panic overwhelmed me-I had to act. Summoning all my courage I slapped him hard across the face pushing him away before bolting for the door.  I grasped the doorknob but Andrew’s grip on my arm yanked me brutally to the ground. He dragged me back pinning me down. In that moment of terror all I could do was scream praying that Dean might hear from outside.  “Please! Help me please!” I screamed but Andrew’s hand clamped over my mouth his voice commanding me to shut up.  The door swung open and Andrew quickly scrambled off me casually leaning against the wall as if nothing had happened while I remained laying on the ground tears streaming down my face.  “Get away from her now!” Dean’s voice rang out sharply.  Andrew scoffed stepping closer. “This isn’t what it looks like. She attacked me. Look at my face she hit me this is what she does!”  Dean stood silent his gaze piercing through Andrew before settling on me. His heart sank seeing me in this state-crying shaking my face flushed with fear. He knew the truth of what had happened.  “You need to leave.” Dean ordered.  With a dismissive laugh Andrew turned towards the door pausing just above me. “I’ll see you soon Y/N. Remember what I said.”  As Andrew exited a wave of relief washed over me though the fear still gripped me tight making me unable to move still shaking and sobbing uncontrollably.  Dean crouched down beside me his touch on my shoulder making me flinch. “Are you alright sweetheart?”  I shook my head hiding my face in my hands mortified by the whole scene. I was sure Dean would regret asking me out now maybe he even believed Andrew’s lies.  He shifted his hand to my back helping me sit up and then did something unexpected—he pulled me onto his arms wrapping me in a protective hug.  I sobbed into his neck gradually calming down as Dean reassured me that everything was okay now that Andrew was gone.  When I finally mustered the courage to meet Dean’s eyes I found only gentleness and understanding in his gaze.  Dean stood up helping me to my feet. “You going to be okay?”  I nodded wiping my tears away but when Dean noticed my bruises now that the makeup was faded his face fell.  He gently touched my cheek his voice filled with concern. “Did he do this to you?” Dean asked softly.  I swallowed hard avoiding his gaze afraid of what he might think of me. But Dean nodded knowingly and drew me into a light hug. “I’m sorry you went through that.”  I shrugged fighting back tears. “It’s alright. I should have known better than to irritate him.”  “From what I saw you weren’t provoking him at all. You were just trying to move on and he clearly has some issues to sort out” Dean reassured me firmly.  I stayed silent unsure of how to respond. Opening up about Andrew before had only led to pain. Would it be the same with Dean?  Dean rubbed his neck awkwardly as we walked back to his truck grabbing some papers from the seat.  “Um I know this is probably bad timing but I still don’t want you to pay for the tires. And I’d still like to take you out to dinner” Dean said sincerely.  Despite the situation I couldn’t help but laugh softly at his persistence. “Dean why do you want to take me out after everything you’ve heard about me?”  He turned to face me muscles flexing as he crossed his arms. “Because none of it seems true to me. You seem kind funny and beautiful. I don’t believe Andrew’s lies and I’d like to get to know you better.”  I was stunned by his sincerity feeling a flutter in my chest at his words. Without overthinking it I closed the distance between us my hands resting on his chest.  Dean looked surprised his eyes fluttering shut as I leaned up to kiss him. It was a moment of relief and hope feeling a connection I hadn’t expected.  When we pulled apart his shy smile left me breathless. “Um so is that a yes to dinner?” Dean asked cheeks tinted pink.  I giggled softly nodding as I took the papers from him to jot down my number. “Definitely yes.”  Dean grinned broadly. “Great. I’ll call you and we can figure out the details okay?”  “Sounds perfect. Thank you Dean for everything” I said gratefully.  He nodded and winked at me sending my heart racing. In that moment I knew Dean was special. He had already begun to change my life and I wanted to do the same for him.  Dean’s POV  I couldn’t get that kiss out of my head. It was incredible especially after everything Andrew put you through. You initiated it and it made my head spin and my heart race. I barely knew you but I knew I wanted to protect you. This whole situation was insane but maybe it was the good kind of crazy.  I parked my truck in the shop’s lot instantly spotting my dad marching over his anger obvious.   Great another problem.  As I stepped out he came closer until he was right in front of me swinging a punch that caught me off guard.  “What the hell Dad?” I protested stumbling back against the truck.  “Don’t ‘what the hell Dad’ me” he snapped. “Andrew Wilson just called. Winchester Mechanics had an interview lined up but he claims you caused a scene with his ex-girlfriend at the motel. I told you to stay away from her!”  Anger simmered inside me. “Dad if you had seen what Andrew was doing to her you would’ve done the same. She was covered in bruises and Andrew’s lying about her.”  “It’s not our damn business! Are you willing to risk our shop over some girl?”  I rolled my eyes leaning back against the truck. “You don’t understand. You should have seen her.”  He scoffed and pushed me against the truck inches from my face. “You better hope Andrew reschedules that interview. All this fuss over a girl is ridiculous.”  He walked away leaving me to wipe the blood from my lip. I didn’t care about the interview or Andrew’s games. All that mattered was making sure Andrew never laid a hand on you again.  Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it! Chapter 3 coming soon stay tuned!

1,Supernatural,['semmwatchlog'],steely-eyedmissileman,The Vampire Diaries Ep. 2x04 Memory Lane  not a good episode title not creative enough.  we begin in my absolute favorite place to begin an episode: a dream sequence. i love dream sequences. i truly think they are teh pinnacle of the television world and i would love nothing more than to see dream sequences all the time. i am obsessed with them. stefan’s dream sequence is not one of the all time greats but it is a very good entry into the genre. stefan’s worst nightmare is damon and elena together. stefan’s other worst nightmare is damon and elena together. stefan’s other other worst nightmare is relating to katherine on anything. she wants him back badly and she’ll use his worst nightmares to get it. this begs the question: did katherine give stefan this dream or his own subconscious?  then he wakes up and the nightmare continues because katherine is in bed with stefan. he initially is sweet to her because he thinks she’s elena but he realizes his mistake fairly quickly. katherine is much stronger than stefan due to her advanced age (and human blood habit). she’s also convinced that she can get stefan to fall in love with her. the shadows are seducing the not-shadows! (because of course damon is still trying to seduce elena even though he fucking murdered her brother three episodes ago.)  jenna is having a barbecue! because damon wants to get to know nawm he suggested it to ht who suggested it to jenna who said yeah that’s a good idea. we also learn from nawm that werewolves don’t automatically change. they have to trigger the curse. nawm triggered it and he is convinced that tyler will not. he refuses to tell tyler what triggers the curse which is really infuriating because tyler deserves to have information about his own fucking life. he’s not a toddler so he should be trusted with all the information about the consequences of his actions not shoved into a little corner like a child. however nawm is insistent that ‘it’s better for you if i don’t tell you.’ this smells like bullshit.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; back at the salvatore house katherine is reading stefan’s journal. he’s giving her blood. katherine read that he doesn’t drink human blood. they talk about werewolves. katherine knows quite a lot about werewolves from her past. we learn that damon had a boyfriend in the past too and he was a werewolf. katherine says &#x27;they werewolves mostly exist now in books and really bad movies’ which is a dig on the teen wolf movie since the show had yet to premier. katherine then brings up the most interesting question she could at this point. why did stefan keep the picture of katherine? from a show perspective it’s to prove that katherine is also played by nina dobrev and to prompt elena to run away giving us the drama of the first mid-season break. katherine says &#x27;you came back here to fall in love with me all over again didn’t you?’ which is a compelling question. stefan then says &#x27;what is it about you that makes me still care?’ as he kisses katherine. i wrote in my notes &#x27;i need to get a spray bottle and start spraying him.’ luckily he was acting and he vamp tranqs her then locks her in the cell downstairs.  then we do torture! stefan wants to know why elena came back and he doesn’t believe it was about him. in the past this werewolf guy says &#x27;because you’re the rope in the salvatore brothers’ tug of war’ which was immediately burned into my brian and i don’t totally remember the context. anyway she reveals that she is a vampire and knows he is a werewolf. &#x27;you think i would move into a town without knowing my enemies.’ she is threatening this man which seems fair to be completely honest.  at the gilbert house jenna continues her campaign to be my favorite character by insisting that damon keep away from elena. she also says &#x27;i have no secrets only dirty shame’ which is a great line. i then wrote &#x27;he’s so fucking awkward.’ i no longer remember who this is a reference to but it could apply to any of the men in this scene. a great damon/nawm exchange: nawm: &#x27;i’ve heard great things about you’ damon: &#x27;that’s weird cause i’m a dick.’  caroline and elena are very interesting here. elena’s asking caroline what’s up with her and caroline seems to be trying to convince elena to break up with stefan. she does do it somewhat subtlely though which is a bit of a surprise. caroline: &#x27;god! i cannot stop eating. stefan says it’s a great way to sublimate the cravings. it’s horrible just fighting the urge for blood every minute of every day.’ elena: &#x27;i know that stefan really hates that part of himself.’ caroline: &#x27;yeah and he hates that you’re a constant temptation.’ elena: &#x27;he said that?’ caroline: &#x27;the desire to rip out your jugular every time he’s with you? trust me it’s there. it’s why i had to break up with matt.’ first off caroline doesn’t directly lie which is a nice touch. she never answers elena’s question just pulls herself in to make a comparison. the reason this conversation is so effective is that caroline is making elena do the imaginative work. secondly caroline you did not break up with matt. he broke up with you. the problems you and matt have are fundamentally different than the problems stefan and elena have though linked. elena’s knowledge of stefan’s true self gives her an advantage that matt doesn’t have in making a relationship work.  meanwhile stefan is also defending his relationship. he claims that he doesn’t pretend to be anything when he’s with elena which is such a blatant lie i laughed out loud. he absolutely pretends to be a real boy with elena not necessarily for her but for himself. he wants to be human and elena gives him a safe place to have that fantasy. stefan claims not to love katherine and to have never loved her. katherine disagrees. it is unclear to me who’s right. i don’t have enough information to make a call but i will say that both of them are claiming the thing that supports their own worldview and disregarding other interpretations. in the flashback stefan touches katherine with gloves on and i wrote in my notes: &#x27;if he took his gloves off i would lose my mind. you hate to see it but it’s also quite p&amp;p pride &amp; prejudice.’ this was a distressing moment. katherine then goes into her room and damon is there with his stupid cute hair. katherine didn’t compel stefan to love her. she says that she only compelled him after he found out what she was. once again i don’t trust that statement but i also don’t necessarily disbelieve her. i’m reserving judgment.  in the present at the gilbert house everyone is eating &#x27;cobbler.’ however their &#x27;cobbler’ is quite clearly not a cobbler but a pie. damon is making boyfriends left and right as he now has a considerable amount of chemistry with nawm. jenna roasts damon again (and herself) &#x27;you’ve never dated you; i’ve dated many yous.’ damon is going to stab nawm.  katherine tells stefan &#x27;love. hate. such a fine line. i can wait’ which is an excellent point and you hate to see it. lockwood of the past struck a deal to save katherine. she needs everyone to believe that she died in the fire. she then kills werewolf man because she is so fucking evil.  at the gilbert house nawm and damon continue to flirt throwing around terms like &#x27;lone wolf’ and &#x27;lady killer.’ caroline is visibly upset and wants to leave the party. however she doesn’t want to go find stefan. caroline is working for katherine.  stefan says that since he and damon didn’t die to keep katherine safe they died for nothing. katherine says &#x27;you died for love.’ while this is true i’m a bit uncertain about the veracity of that love for both of them (especially stefan). neither damon nor stefan knows who katherine truly is. damon knows she’s a vampire but he doesn’t really know her. she’s been compelling both of them fairly regularly and clearly hasn’t been honest about her past. if the boys do love katherine at this point they don’t love her. they love an idea of her. and katherine may have been happy with that and she may want that back but i think that love would never be sustainable in the long run.  in the present damon is threatening nawm. nawm does not want to fight because he came here to help his family. he wants to rise above the blood feud. nawm and ht agree to watch a game next week and damon says &#x27;let’s not catch that game next week’ to ht in a scene full of tension. jenna is standing right there the whole time. i’m so sorry jenna.  caroline is preventing elena from making it to stefan’s and elena eventually leaves caroline alone which is not a good idea because she is upset and has killed people before. everything’s fine though.  damon stabs nawm when he could have just been normal about things.  stefan’s going a little feral. katherine threatens to kill everyone elena loves unless stefan gets rid of her. katherine then reveals that she is resistant to vervain after decades of poison training. katherine stabs stefan in the leg. then katherine and elena meet. we get a fascinating exchange that i cannot wait to learn more about. elena: &#x27;how do we look exactly alike?’ katherine: &#x27;you’re asking the wrong questions.’  meanwhile nawm tells tyler how to activate the curse. if you kill a person the werewolf curse falls on you. this brings up a question: what would have happened if caroline died in the car crash? tyler needs this information in case of a dire accident! (the conversation they had leading up to this revelation was gold. tyler: &#x27;how was that barbecue?’ nawm: &#x27;not great. are you still pissed?’ tyler: &#x27;are you still keeping secrets?’ nawm: &#x27;yep.’ tyler: &#x27;then i’m still pissed.’)  elena and stefan go on a date to the only bar in town where elena admits that caroline has a point re the whole vampire thing. elena forgives caroline because &#x27;you were just being a good friend in your own way.’ the two lovebirds need to break up. stefan’s never going to do it so they have to make elena do it. katherine doesn’t want to kill elena. she would have killed elena when john was dying if she wanted to. elena would be dead a hundred times over if katherine wanted it. stefan needs to stop letting katherine convince him that she wants elena dead. elena asks stefan &#x27;why are you giving her so much power over our situation?’ stefan says &#x27;she wants us to fight.’ damon and caroline both overheard the break up. damon talks to katherine afterward and says he’d die again. &#x27;been there done that least this time it’ll be worth it.’  however it wasn’t a real breakup thank goddess. stefan claims &#x27;i don’t do jealous not with you not anymore.’ which is an awfully nice thought but i’m sure that it is not entirely true. stefan will be jealous of damon for any reason whenever and he would certainly be jealous if damon started flirting with elena. you can repress your emotions as much as you want stefan but it won’t make you stop feeling them. katherine has leverage over caroline and is making caroline do her dirty work. stefan and elena need to keep up the act to keep katherine off their scent.  stefan says toward the end of the episode that katherine is incapable of love. is she? we get hints that she is capable of love. when she pauses by herself to remember kissing damon and stefan’s dying bodies it certainly seems like love. there’s no one there for her to act for so her only reason to behave as she does is that she is genuinely emotional. this points to katherine feeling genuine love. however obsession and love are two very different things. katherine doesn’t seem to care about stefan about his happiness and his life. she wants how he makes her feel rather than his well-being. katherine does not love stefan she is attached to him. he matters to her because she likes the way he makes her feel. under stefan’s gaze she feels important and valuable. i also think that some part of her is excited by playing him off of damon and controlling him. i do believe that katherine genuinely cared about stefan in some way. i don’t think that those feelings are love.,2024-07-11 01:20:04 GMT

1,Supernatural,['semmwatchlog'],steely-eyedmissileman,Supernatural Ep. 6x12 Like a Virgin  look i understand why dean wouldn’t want to tell sam what happened over the past year. even beyond the wall thing dean doesn’t want to acknowledge his own failures over the past year. he doesn’t want to acknowledge all teh ways he failed with lisa and ben or the ways he failed sam. he wants to forget what has happened to him and move on. from dean’s perspective all telling sam about the actions of his soulless self will do is bring sam’s pity on dean’s situation. and he is not prepared for pity.  should sam be blamed for the actions of his soulless self? well that’s the question at the heart of so much vampire media. and i still don’t know the answer to it. in supernatural specifically i don’t think that sam should take any blame. other than being played by jared padalecki and having the right memories soulless sam is very different from souled sam. they are so different as to be two different people. soulless sam certainly considered them to be two people. i understand why sam is having so much trouble with his past actions though. sam is a guilt machine (like all winchesters) and this is a big load of guilt he can force himself to shoulder.,2024-07-11 01:11:11 GMT

Sam tried to give Meg the demon blade to hold off the hellhounds and she tells him to keep it so they can kill Crowley with it. THEN she kisses Cas to steal his angel blade and relays that she’s unsure if it will kill the hellhounds.  I ask this more from a fan fic writer’s POV than a viewer but:  If angels are generally more powerful than demons isn’t the angel blade more powerful than the demon blade?  Or: Wouldn’t the angel blade be able to kill both Crowley and the hellhounds?,2024-07-11 01:06:05 GMT

It’s not safe for you. Just go”He really doesn’t care but he doesn’t need anyone around him right now. He would be feeling really bad about himself because everyone had been turning their backs on him and not trusting him lately but he didn’t feel anything anymore. He just didn’t care if anything happened to his loved ones.   He grabs your wrist tightly but not too tight that it hurts and walks with you somewhere else still holding onto your wrist. He then sits you down somewhere isolated away from any danger. Y/n groans “seriously?” She crosses her arms  He lets go of you and looks at you with his emotionless face “Yes seriously. Being around me isn’t safe. I don’t know what will happen with me. I’m a danger to anyone near me.” Y/n stares at him “Sammy I wanna help you.. please”   He looks away from you “You can’t help me. There’s nothing you can do to help me. You’d only be putting yourself in more danger by staying around me.” There is a hint of sadness in his voice. He doesn’t want people to get hurt because of him. He looks back at you with his cold empty eyes  Y/n stares at him “I love you Sammy please don’t push me away” His eyes slightly soften for a moment before he looks away from you again. “No. You shouldn’t love me. You don’t know how dangerous I can be. I don’t want to be responsible for anything bad happening to you. I am pushing you away for your own good.” Y/n stays quiet “Sam..”  He looks back at you his expression hardens “Don’t. I don’t want you around me. You should go.” He wants you to stay though. He wants you to not give up on him. But he feels like you should get away from him and not waste your time on someone like him. He would think that you deserve better.  Y/n crosses her arms “I’m not giving you up” He grits his teeth “Damn it Y/N. I told you I can’t have you around. Don’t be so damn stubborn!” He takes a deep breath to calm down before he looks at you again “You have no idea what I am capable of. I can hurt you. I don’t want to be responsible for it.”  Y/n stares at him and kisses him He was surprised for a moment from the sudden kiss but gave in to it kissing you back. He had missed you and missed the closeness you guys had. He wraps his arms around you and deepens the kiss  Y/n wraps her arms around his neck. He pulls you closer to him pressing you against him as he continues the kiss. He had been missing you a lot and craving for your touch and your proximity. He is holding onto you tightly as if he’s afraid that you might suddenly disappear if he lets go.  He finally breaks the kiss after a while in need of air. He looks at you with a mix of longing and sadness in his eyes “We shouldn’t… be doing this. I’m not good for you. You deserve better than me. You should get away from me before it’s too late.”   Y/n rubs his cheek and smiles softly. He looks at you for a moment before closing his eyes enjoying the feeling of your touch on his cheek. He sighs softly and looks at you again his expression still full of sadness “Why do you have to be so damn stubborn and not listen to me?”  Y/n smiles softly &quot;wake up Sammy your just dreaming..” He looks at you confused and slightly irritated “What are you talking about?”He grabs your wrist again but this time it’s not as gentle as before “Don’t try messing with me Y/N. This isn’t a dream.” he growls   He sits up suddenly his breathing labored “What the… What did just…” He puts a hand over his chest his heart beating fast. He looks around taking in his surroundings and realizing he was in his room at the bunker  Y/n was fast asleep next to him. Sam looked at you and his breathing started to slow down. He looks at you for a moment. You looked so beautiful. Even more so when you were fast asleep. He wanted to reach out and touch you but restrains himself from doing so not wanting to disturb your sleep.  He laid back down being careful not to wake you up. He just silently stares at the ceiling going over the dream - or nightmare - he just had. He thinks that it had felt so real and so vivid. It was almost like it actually happened and not just a dream.  He turns to look at you again and his eyes roam over your body for a moment taking in your appearance. He thinks that you looked absolutely stunning even more so in that nightdress that you were currently wearing. He thought that you were a literal angel that he was lucky to have.  He shakes his head scolding himself for allowing his mind to go into those territories. He closes his eyes and tries to get some sleep but he kept thinking about the dream and thinking about you. His mind was just filled with thoughts of you.  Sam laid there struggling to sleep as his thoughts continued to wander. He glances at you watching your peaceful form as you slept next to him your soft breaths filling his ears He couldn’t stop thinking about you about how much he loved you and how much he longed for you.   He wanted to reach out and pull you close to him to hold you in his arms and never let go He knew that he was dangerously in love with you but he couldn’t help himself. You were like a drug and he was addicted to you.   He rolls over and looks at you again. He watches the way your chest rises and falls with each breath and the way your hair is splayed out on the pillow around you. He wanted to run his fingers through your hair and feel its softness He couldn’t take his eyes off you thinking that you looked so beautiful and peaceful. He longed to reach out and touch you to feel your skin against his but he didn’t want to risk waking you up.   Sam laid there wide awake. His mind was stuck in a never ending loop of memories and thoughts of you. He couldn’t sleep his heart filled with feelings and his mind filled with thoughts of you.       He was utterly and completely in love with you. Every part of him ached with how much he loved you and he longed to be with you to hold you close and never let go. But for now all he could do was lay there and stare at you admiring your beauty in the moonlight.   His heart swelled in his chest as he thought about you. He thought about the way you laugh the way you smile the way you talk and the way you drive him crazy. He thought about the way your touch sends shivers down his spine and the way your presence makes him feel like he’s home     He couldn’t imagine life without you and the thought of it filled him with dread. He would do anything for you anything to make you smile and be happy. And he would always be there for you no matter what.  He silently watched you sleep your soft breathing filling his ears. He wanted to reach out and touch you to feel your skin against his and to hold you in his arms. But he didn’t want to disturb your sleep so he just lay there watching you and thinking about how lucky he was to have you   He longed to tell you how he felt to confess his love and pour his heart out to you. But he didn’t want to scare you away not when he finally had you within his reach.  He didn’t care about your appearance. He loved every part of you no matter what. He loved your curves or your chubbiness it didn’t matter to him. All that mattered was that you were you and that he was completely in love with you.  He thought that you were perfect just the way you were. He loved your body no matter what shape or size it was. He thought that you were the most beautiful person in the world and he would tell you that everyday if he could.   He thought about the way your body felt against his - how soft and warm and perfect it was. He thought about the way you looked when you were in the throes of passion and the way his heart would skip a beat every time you touched him.  He couldn’t take his eyes off you admiring every inch of you. He wanted to worship you and shower you with love and affection. He thought that you were the most precious thing to him and that he was the luckiest man alive to have you in his life.,2024-07-11 02:40:32 GMT
13,Supernatural,['spn fanfic'  'castiel'  'sam and dean'],stvrfir0,Teaching make-up   Cas x fem curvy Winchester reader   Castiel. An angel who thought he’d never be able to experience true love. He really did believe that. Until he met you. Y/n Sam and Dean Winchesters’ sister. Every time you’re around he looks at you like he’s in awe.   Tonight Sam and Dean left the bunker to go hunt a Shapeshifter. Because it was an easy case they told you and Castiel to stay back. So now Castiel is watching intently as you show him your makeup routine. “So you’re basically using your face as a canvas?”  Y/n smiles softly “well yes” (Y/n was 5&#x27;5 feet tall and she had long curly brown hair and beautiful Doe eyes that were golden hazel and she had pink lips and freckles around her face and she had a curvy body and her hips sway each time she walked and she was wearing a black Plus Solid Mermaid Skirt and a chocolate brown Solid Tube Crop Top)  Castiel would look at Anlie up and down blushing at her curvy figure. He smiled at how her hips swayed. He didn’t understand why it made his heart beat faster or why he was so entranced.     Castiel would slowly step closer to her his eyes locked on her hips. This was a perfect opportunity to figure out why his heart was so excited. He would reach down and gently grab her hips holding them in his hands.   Y/n smiles and makes him sit “now the real fun starts” she starts doing his skincare. Castiel would blush softly when she makes him sit down. He still wasn’t sure what this was for but he wouldn’t question her that would make her upset. His heart would still be racing as he looked up at her. He tried to calm it but looking into her eyes made it harder to. He’d watch as she does his skin care and smile gently. He loved how close he was to her and how good her hands felt on his face.  Castiel would be quiet as she puts the care on his face. He couldn’t take his eyes off her face. She looked so focused which made her look so stunning. Just being this close to her was enough for his heart to beat fast. Once she finished putting her care on his face he’d look at her questioningly. “So… what now?” He asked curiously his voice low and soft.  Y/n hums softy “just for a bit…” Castiel would nod watching her as she hums softly. Every movement she made every sound she made… he would follow intently. He felt so… intrigued. Like every bit of her captured his attention and he couldn’t look away. “How long is ‘just a bit?“ .He asked curiously tilting his head slightly.  Y/n checks her phone &quot;5 minutes..” she smiles softly Castiel would nod his eyes staying fixed on her. The fact that she was so close to him so focused on him was making his heart race once again. Although he was better this time at not letting it show on his face. He’d take a deep breath calming his heart once again. “Alright. 5 minutes. We can do 5 minutes.”   He stated a soft smile on his face. It felt like an eternity as he waited for her to remove the mask. Every second he spent looking up at her with this mask over his face he was admiring her. The way she hummed the way her hair fell over her shoulders the way her eyes seemed focused on the time. Finally after a few more minutes he’d speak up again. “It’s been 5 minutes… can you remove it now?” He asked curiously tilting his face so she could reach better.   Y/n would chuckle and nod pulling the mask off of his face. She’d smile down at him realizing the look he was giving her. It was the same look she had seen on his face before. She’d run her hand gently down his cheek her eyes following her fingertips as she did so. “What?” She asked tilting her head to one side.  Castiel would blush softly as she ran her hand down his cheek. Feeling her gentle touch on his skin would make his heart start racing. He’d look at her his eyes staring into hers his expression a mixture of embarrassment and awe. He’d clear his throat softly shifting in his seat. “I… um… I was just thinking.” He mumbled looking down and fiddling with his tie.  Y/n would chuckle softly noticing the blush on his face and his fiddling with his tie. It was so obvious that she was affecting him yet she pretended to not notice. Her hand would linger on the side of his face for a second before dropping back down to her side. “Thinking about what?” She asked curiously looking down at him.     Castiel would swallow hard his heart racing a million beats per second. When she took her hand away he found himself missing her touch almost immediately. He’d look back up at her his blue eyes fixed on hers. His voice would be quieter than usual as he was embarrassed by the thoughts going through his head. “Thinking about… you…” He mumbled his cheeks blushing even more.,2024-07-11 02:38:53 GMT

We might end up knocking over half the furniture.”  Dean shrugs nonchalantly. “Eh it’ll be fun. Plus it’s good exercise.”  With a playful eye-roll you agree to indulge his idea of fun.

Somewhere between debates over house rules and raiding the monopoly man’s bank the atmosphere shifts. There’s a charged energy between you a lingering tension that neither of you acknowledges outright.  When you finally tire of Monopoly Dean suggests a break. He fetches a couple of beers from the fridge and you settle on the couch shoulders brushing as you sip in companionable silence. The bunker feels warmer suddenly the walls less confining with Dean so close beside you.  “You know” Dean begins his voice lower than usual “this isn’t exactly how I imagined spending days trapped underground.”  You raise an eyebrow a smirk on your lips. “Oh and how did you imagine it Dean?”  He meets your gaze his green eyes darkening slightly with something unreadable. “Maybe a bit more… action-packed” he teases his tone laced with a hint of flirtation.  You chuckle softly feeling a warmth spread through you at his implication. “Well who says our day can’t get more exciting?”  Dean’s smile turns into a knowing grin as he leans closer his breath mingling with yours. “I like the way you think.”  Before you can fully process his words his lips are on yours a gentle yet firm kiss that sends a thrill through your body. His hands find their way to your waist pulling you closer as if he’s been waiting for this moment as eagerly as you had.  The kiss deepens becoming more urgent and passionate fueled by the tension that had been building between you for days. Dean’s lips are warm and inviting his touch confident yet tender. It’s as if you’d both been holding back waiting for the right moment to let go of your cares.  You tangle your fingers in his hair as you deepen the kiss savoring the taste of him. The world outside the bunker fades away leaving only the sensation of Dean’s lips on yours and the steady beat of his heart against your chest.  When you finally pull apart breathless and flushed Dean rests his forehead against yours; his hands still resting gently on your waist. “Wow” he murmurs his voice hoarse with emotion.  “Yeah” You manage to reply your own voice quieted by the action that was slowly fading.

Late 20s. No ID -CH 5 - Soulmates and Other Rare Bonds Summary: You’re a writer but in your free time you volunteer at the local hospital and that’s how you met him. A very beautiful man found alone and dying in an abandoned warehouse. After being asked to sit with him and see if your presence causes him to wake or at least respond you do but that choice may change you in ways you could never have imagined.   Characters: Dean Winchester Sam Winchester Bobby Singer Marla (OFC) You/Reader   Warnings: hospital stay mentions of death both in the hospital setting and the reader’s past show level violence/ gore angst fluff.

Chapter Warnings: Reader learns more about the supernatural world   A/N: this whole fic came from this one image  Word Count: 1733  Divider and Cover Image by me  Masterlist | Series Masterlist  Once we arrived at his property I wasn’t surprised by the look of it “he lives in a junkyard?” I asked “I’m not so surprised by that.”  Dean laughed as he shut the car off “Salvage yard” he corrected and rushed to open the door and help me stand out of the car; when our hands connected I felt a rush and then was hit with some more visions.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Bobby playing catch with two boys several images – like snapshots – I couldn’t figure those out.  Then I could see Bobby yelling “You stupid ass! What did you do?” he grabbed Dean’s lapels and shook him “What did you do?!” he shouted. “You made a deal – for Sam didn’t you?”  My head was spinning – ‘what the hell did that mean?!’  Dean apparently got hit with visions of his own because he jerked from me and grabbed his head “oh fuck! What was that?”  “What? What happened?”  “I – I saw” his eyes went from angry to completely soft “I saw what you did the night you lost your family” he whispered.  I was terrified to touch him and yet I just wanted to hug him – that confused me because I wasn’t sure who the hug was meant to comfort at that moment but I didn’t have enough time to think about it too long because the door swung open startling a squeak from me.  “What are you doin’ here kiddo?” Bobby asked when his eyes landed on me.  Dean kept a bit of distance between him and I “we got attacked.”  “Well get yer asses inside then” Bobby barked as he wheeled back to give us room to come inside.  ‘Why is he in a wheelchair?’ I wondered.   Dean grabbed my bags and one of his “I can carry my own bags” I offered.  “I got it get inside where it’s safe.”  I complied because I had a feeling there was no point in arguing with him – inside was no less crowded than outside but it was books something I was at least a little more familiar with.  We caught Bobby up on the day – minus the details of the visions and he said he’d make a couple calls because it “sounds bigger than the normal demon chasing a Winchester activity.”  While he was gone I spilled the tea on what I’d seen and began to ask Dean what the hell was happening – to say I was unprepared for our conversation is the understatement of the year.  I was sitting there in utter shock at the news Dean had heaped upon me.  “Did you break her?” Bobby’s voice snapped me out of my bubble.  “I’m not drunk enough for this” I grumbled as I stood up and began pacing the room. “First you tell me the man who murdered my family wasn’t just some crazy dude now you’re telling me that demons are real and are after me?!”  “No they are most likely after me but you got caught in the middle.”  “Ok fine but what about these creepy visions?!”  Bobby’s head snapped to my direction “what visions?”  I recounted to him about some of what I’d seen since touching Dean’s hand and the more I spoke the paler Bobby appeared.  “Bobby? Are you ok man?” Dean asked.  “She can’t be like Sam could she?”  “I don’t think so” Dean shrugged and glanced at me.  “It wouldn’t fit the pattern her ma and pa were killed by a Rougarou.”  “How the fuck do you know that?”  Bobby hung his head “how do you think I knew you were in the hospital darlin?”  “I thought you stopped in to volunteer that’s what the nurse told me.”  “Well yeah monster hunters can’t exactly tell everyone their business.”  “How did I not know this before?”  “You’d already lost a lot of blood and your mind was trying to shut down due to the trauma.”  I glanced at Dean “don’t look at me like that.”  “Like what?”  “Like you’re sorry for me. Like I’m just another poor sap to be pitied” I snapped.  “I don’t. I don’t think you’re someone to be pitied. You’re one of the strongest people I’ve ever met.”    “You two gonna quit actin like a married couple and work on this demon issue or what?”  I was shocked at Bobby’s words but in that moment I figured he was right demons seemed like a much bigger problem than whatever Dean and I had going between us.  “How do we fix this? How do we keep Dean safe?” I asked Bobby.  Dean scoffed “WE” he paused making a little circular motion with his pointer for emphasis “don’t do anything to keep Dean safe. The point of bringing you here was to keep you safe” he reminded us.  “That’s your viewpoint Sir” I quipped causing Bobby to groan and wheel off into another room.  “This isn’t a joke Y/N.”  “I know and somehow it feels like you think your life is a joke. I did not get your car out of impound and spend days living through flashes of your life to be tossed aside. I’m in this now.”  “I’m not gonna get you to stand down am I?”  “I will when you do. Dean there’s something beyond me here. Someway I have got to understand this. If we’re having visions of each other’s pasts and there’s demons behind it don’t you think I deserve to know more and to help stop it?!”  “Stay here” he scrubbed his hand down his face “I need a minute to think and I gotta call Sammy” he huffed and trudged out the front door.  When he didn’t return for more than 15 minutes I started to worry “Bobby?” I called out.  “Yes darlin?”  “Should I be worried he hasn’t returned?”  “Nah he’s a hot head sometimes” Bobby chuckled “let’s start dinner and you can catch me up on your life and how you came to be with Dean.”  “I’m not “with Dean” Bobby” I argued.  “Let’s get dinner started and then the three of us need to talk” Bobby remarked as he began pulling items from the fridge and cabinets.   “What are we cooking?” I asked as I lined the items he’d already given me on the counter next to the stove.  “My famous chili.”  I snorted a laugh “famous or infamous?”  At least that got a laugh from him as he pulled a pan out and began browning some ground beef.  “I can help ya know” i scoffed and he scooted back and set about working on opening cans and mixing some spices - like it was a true secret and he didn’t want me to know.   Once dinner was ready and we were settled around the table to eat Bobby brought up a completely new idea.  “What do you two know about twin flames?’  “Uh what?” Dean finally responded after several silent beats.  Bobby left the table wheeling into a room off the living-room; returning with a blue and gold leather book that read Soulmates and Other Rare Bonds – a curious title to say the least.  An hour later with a full belly and a mind full of new ideas I had a realization – Bobby was right Dean was scared and I’d met the man of my dreams.  I figured life would sneak up on me with love someday but finding your “twin flame” – the person you literally share a mental link and a part of your soul with; well that’s something special no matter how you look at it.  Of course Dean practically ran out the door when Bobby finished explaining; and backing the whole thing up with the fancy blue book – but I knew – I had no doubts of the truth because of all that I’d learned of Dean from our link.  The idea of connecting to him terrified and exhilarated me at the same time; when I finally got the courage to step outside to find him I felt lighter than I had in many years. I already knew Dean would reject the idea because he wouldn’t deem himself worthy of such adoration love or even compassion. I wasn’t even sure how I knew it but I knew it to be a fact – the same as saying the sky appears blue to most humans or that the ocean is mostly unexplored by humankind.  The sight of him standing next to his Baby as the sun sunk into the background made my heart skip several beats – I know this will sound cliché but he was so handsome he took my breath away and I literally had to remind myself to take a breath.  “Can we talk?”  “About what?”  “Anything? I get that this is big news and I’m sure there’s no way to prove it scientifically but well I would like to get to know you. I want to help you find your brother and I just have this urge to get to know you – anyone who’s important to you is worth knowing.”  “I’m so not” he scoffed “you have no idea who I am or what I’ve done in my past.”  “I don’t care. I still want to know you.”  He glared at me but just stood there with his arms crossed over his chest leaned against his car looking like sex on bowed legs– so I did the only thing I could think of in that moment; I marched up to him and kissed him.  It wasn’t some magical moment the movies portray where I saw fireworks behind my eyelids my foot popped up and I suddenly believed in love at first sight or whatever.  No this moment was emotions it was raw and real – his lips were slightly scratchy and his scruff tickled but it felt right – good even. This was what I was missing! As Dean got lost in the moment his hands came down to my hips tugging my body slightly closer to his. I realized then that I didn’t want fairy tales and magical kisses no I wanted passion and raw emotion – just what Dean had to offer. We were a match – both hurting in our own ways always searching for some form of relief but somehow his touch offered a measure of that as his warmth seeped into my body.  “Why would you do that?” his voice came out even deeper and raspy.  “Because we both needed it” I replied.

Late 20s. No ID -CH 5 - Soulmates and Other Rare Bonds Summary: You’re a writer but in your free time you volunteer at the local hospital and that’s how you met him. A very beautiful man found alone and dying in an abandoned warehouse. After being asked to sit with him and see if your presence causes him to wake or at least respond you do but that choice may change you in ways you could never have imagined.   Characters: Dean Winchester Sam Winchester Bobby Singer Marla (OFC) You/Reader   Warnings: hospital stay mentions of death both in the hospital setting and the reader’s past show level violence/ gore angst fluff. Expect more/ new warnings as each chapter requires.   Chapter Warnings: Reader learns more about the supernatural world   A/N: this whole fic came from this one image  Word Count: 1733  Divider and Cover Image by me  Masterlist | Series Masterlist  Once we arrived at his property I wasn’t surprised by the look of it “he lives in a junkyard?” I asked “I’m not so surprised by that.”  Dean laughed as he shut the car off “Salvage yard” he corrected and rushed to open the door and help me stand out of the car; when our hands connected I felt a rush and then was hit with some more visions.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Bobby playing catch with two boys several images – like snapshots – I couldn’t figure those out.  Then I could see Bobby yelling “You stupid ass! What did you do?” he grabbed Dean’s lapels and shook him “What did you do?!” he shouted. “You made a deal – for Sam didn’t you?”  My head was spinning – ‘what the hell did that mean?!’  Dean apparently got hit with visions of his own because he jerked from me and grabbed his head “oh fuck! What was that?”  “What? What happened?”  “I – I saw” his eyes went from angry to completely soft “I saw what you did the night you lost your family” he whispered.  I was terrified to touch him and yet I just wanted to hug him – that confused me because I wasn’t sure who the hug was meant to comfort at that moment but I didn’t have enough time to think about it too long because the door swung open startling a squeak from me.  “What are you doin’ here kiddo?” Bobby asked when his eyes landed on me.  Dean kept a bit of distance between him and I “we got attacked.”  “Well get yer asses inside then” Bobby barked as he wheeled back to give us room to come inside.  ‘Why is he in a wheelchair?’ I wondered.   Dean grabbed my bags and one of his “I can carry my own bags” I offered.  “I got it get inside where it’s safe.”  I complied because I had a feeling there was no point in arguing with him – inside was no less crowded than outside but it was books something I was at least a little more familiar with.  We caught Bobby up on the day – minus the details of the visions and he said he’d make a couple calls because it “sounds bigger than the normal demon chasing a Winchester activity.”  While he was gone I spilled the tea on what I’d seen and began to ask Dean what the hell was happening – to say I was unprepared for our conversation is the understatement of the year.  I was sitting there in utter shock at the news Dean had heaped upon me.  “Did you break her?” Bobby’s voice snapped me out of my bubble.  “I’m not drunk enough for this” I grumbled as I stood up and began pacing the room. “First you tell me the man who murdered my family wasn’t just some crazy dude now you’re telling me that demons are real and are after me?!”  “No they are most likely after me but you got caught in the middle.”  “Ok fine but what about these creepy visions?!”  Bobby’s head snapped to my direction “what visions?”  I recounted to him about some of what I’d seen since touching Dean’s hand and the more I spoke the paler Bobby appeared.  “Bobby? Are you ok man?” Dean asked.  “She can’t be like Sam could she?”  “I don’t think so” Dean shrugged and glanced at me.  “It wouldn’t fit the pattern her ma and pa were killed by a Rougarou.”  “How the fuck do you know that?”  Bobby hung his head “how do you think I knew you were in the hospital darlin?”  “I thought you stopped in to volunteer that’s what the nurse told me.”  “Well yeah monster hunters can’t exactly tell everyone their business.”  “How did I not know this before?”  “You’d already lost a lot of blood and your mind was trying to shut down due to the trauma.”  I glanced at Dean “don’t look at me like that.”  “Like what?”  “Like you’re sorry for me. Like I’m just another poor sap to be pitied” I snapped.  “I don’t. I don’t think you’re someone to be pitied. You’re one of the strongest people I’ve ever met.”    “You two gonna quit actin like a married couple and work on this demon issue or what?”  I was shocked at Bobby’s words but in that moment I figured he was right demons seemed like a much bigger problem than whatever Dean and I had going between us.  “How do we fix this? How do we keep Dean safe?” I asked Bobby.  Dean scoffed “WE” he paused making a little circular motion with his pointer for emphasis “don’t do anything to keep Dean safe. The point of bringing you here was to keep you safe” he reminded us.  “That’s your viewpoint Sir” I quipped causing Bobby to groan and wheel off into another room.  “This isn’t a joke Y/N.”  “I know and somehow it feels like you think your life is a joke. I did not get your car out of impound and spend days living through flashes of your life to be tossed aside. I’m in this now.”  “I’m not gonna get you to stand down am I?”  “I will when you do. Dean there’s something beyond me here. Someway I have got to understand this. If we’re having visions of each other’s pasts and there’s demons behind it don’t you think I deserve to know more and to help stop it?!”  “Stay here” he scrubbed his hand down his face “I need a minute to think and I gotta call Sammy” he huffed and trudged out the front door.  When he didn’t return for more than 15 minutes I started to worry “Bobby?” I called out.  “Yes darlin?”  “Should I be worried he hasn’t returned?”  “Nah he’s a hot head sometimes” Bobby chuckled “let’s start dinner and you can catch me up on your life and how you came to be with Dean.”  “I’m not “with Dean” Bobby” I argued.  “Let’s get dinner started and then the three of us need to talk” Bobby remarked as he began pulling items from the fridge and cabinets.   “What are we cooking?” I asked as I lined the items he’d already given me on the counter next to the stove.  “My famous chili.”  I snorted a laugh “famous or infamous?”  At least that got a laugh from him as he pulled a pan out and began browning some ground beef.  “I can help ya know” i scoffed and he scooted back and set about working on opening cans and mixing some spices - like it was a true secret and he didn’t want me to know.   Once dinner was ready and we were settled around the table to eat Bobby brought up a completely new idea.  “What do you two know about twin flames?’  “Uh what?” Dean finally responded after several silent beats.  Bobby left the table wheeling into a room off the living-room; returning with a blue and gold leather book that read Soulmates and Other Rare Bonds – a curious title to say the least.  An hour later with a full belly and a mind full of new ideas I had a realization – Bobby was right Dean was scared and I’d met the man of my dreams.  I figured life would sneak up on me with love someday but finding your “twin flame” – the person you literally share a mental link and a part of your soul with; well that’s something special no matter how you look at it.  Of course Dean practically ran out the door when Bobby finished explaining; and backing the whole thing up with the fancy blue book – but I knew – I had no doubts of the truth because of all that I’d learned of Dean from our link.  The idea of connecting to him terrified and exhilarated me at the same time; when I finally got the courage to step outside to find him I felt lighter than I had in many years. I already knew Dean would reject the idea because he wouldn’t deem himself worthy of such adoration love or even compassion. I wasn’t even sure how I knew it but I knew it to be a fact – the same as saying the sky appears blue to most humans or that the ocean is mostly unexplored by humankind.  The sight of him standing next to his Baby as the sun sunk into the background made my heart skip several beats – I know this will sound cliché but he was so handsome he took my breath away and I literally had to remind myself to take a breath.  “Can we talk?”  “About what?”  “Anything? I get that this is big news and I’m sure there’s no way to prove it scientifically but well I would like to get to know you. I want to help you find your brother and I just have this urge to get to know you – anyone who’s important to you is worth knowing.”  “I’m so not” he scoffed “you have no idea who I am or what I’ve done in my past.”  “I don’t care. I still want to know you.”  He glared at me but just stood there with his arms crossed over his chest leaned against his car looking like sex on bowed legs– so I did the only thing I could think of in that moment; I marched up to him and kissed him.  It wasn’t some magical moment the movies portray where I saw fireworks behind my eyelids my foot popped up and I suddenly believed in love at first sight or whatever.  No this moment was emotions it was raw and real – his lips were slightly scratchy and his scruff tickled but it felt right – good even. This was what I was missing! As Dean got lost in the moment his hands came down to my hips tugging my body slightly closer to his. I realized then that I didn’t want fairy tales and magical kisses no I wanted passion and raw emotion – just what Dean had to offer. We were a match – both hurting in our own ways always searching for some form of relief but somehow his touch offered a measure of that as his warmth seeped into my body.  “Why would you do that?” his voice came out even deeper and raspy.  “Because we both needed it” I replied.

Sam slammed the book shut the sudden noise making Dean jump. “No Dean! It says here it leaves footprints with a cleft hoof and a bird’s claw!”  Dean who was sprawled lazily on a nearby chair flipped a page of a tattered comic book with a dismissive snort. “Big whoop. Probably just some oversized possum scaring the locals.”  Sam scowled. “Dad takes all these things seriously Dean. Why can’t you?”  “Look Sammy” Dean said sitting up a little straighter “Dad’s got the experience. He knows things and he’s seen them before but I bet he’d think we’re a bunch of idiots for this. There’s no point in getting our hopes up on finding some winged demon goat. I don’t even think they’re real.”  Sam’s shoulders slumped. He understood Dean’s logic but something about the legend of the Demon Goat the mystery of it all sparked a thrill in him. He longed to be a part of his dad’s world not forgotten in some random town and some random backwoods motel.  “Maybe not” Sam mumbled more to himself than Dean. “But wouldn’t it be cool if there was something out there? This would be my first hunt. Maybe Dad would come back and help us—help me.”  Dean’s playful facade faltered for a moment. He looked at Sam a flicker of worry crossing his features.  “Yeah it would” he finally admitted his voice softer than usual. “But right now our job is to stick with what Dad’s instructed us. We stay here and wait for him to come get us. We’re a team remember?”  Sam met Dean’s gaze a spark of determination replacing the disappointment in his eyes. “Yeah a team” he echoed a small smile playing on his lips. He didn’t know if they’d ever encounter the Demon Goat but one thing was clear—they’d face whatever came their way together.  “Alright then Van Helsing” Dean said a mischievous glint in his eyes “let’s see if this book of yours mentions any weaknesses for giant demon goats.”  Sam couldn’t help but grin. With renewed enthusiasm Sam flipped open the book once more ready to delve into the lore of the Demon Goat with his brother by his side.,2024-07-11 09:53:14 GMT

Sam slammed the book shut the sudden noise making Dean jump. “No Dean! It says here it leaves footprints with a cleft hoof and a bird’s claw!”  Dean who was sprawled lazily on a nearby chair flipped a page of a tattered comic book with a dismissive snort. “Big whoop. Probably just some oversized possum scaring the locals.”  Sam scowled. “Dad takes all these things seriously Dean. Why can’t you?”  “Look Sammy” Dean said sitting up a little straighter “Dad’s got the experience. He knows things and he’s seen them before but I bet he’d think we’re a bunch of idiots for this. There’s no point in getting our hopes up on finding some winged demon goat. I don’t even think they’re real.”  Sam’s shoulders slumped. He understood Dean’s logic but something about the legend of the Demon Goat the mystery of it all sparked a thrill in him. He longed to be a part of his dad’s world not forgotten in some random town and some random backwoods motel.  “Maybe not” Sam mumbled more to himself than Dean. “But wouldn’t it be cool if there was something out there? This would be my first hunt. Maybe Dad would come back and help us—help me.”  Dean’s playful facade faltered for a moment. He looked at Sam a flicker of worry crossing his features.  “Yeah it would” he finally admitted his voice softer than usual. “But right now our job is to stick with what Dad’s instructed us. We stay here and wait for him to come get us. We’re a team remember?”  Sam met Dean’s gaze a spark of determination replacing the disappointment in his eyes. “Yeah a team” he echoed a small smile playing on his lips. He didn’t know if they’d ever encounter the Demon Goat but one thing was clear—they’d face whatever came their way together.  “Alright then Van Helsing” Dean said a mischievous glint in his eyes “let’s see if this book of yours mentions any weaknesses for giant demon goats.”  Sam couldn’t help but grin. With renewed enthusiasm Sam flipped open the book once more ready to delve into the lore of the Demon Goat with his brother by his side.,2024-07-11 09:53:14 GMT

18,Supernatural,['spn meta'],little-escapist,I’m rewatching Supernatural from the start and I may have cracked why the early seasons are so dear to me (or well there are many reasons but this is one more).   Sam and Dean are humane in a way they are not in the later years. There’s a different kind of darkness in them because there is also their humanity to counteract their job of killing: they struggle to kill (Croatoan). They feel bad when people get killed - they care about the people demons possess. They have a hard life and it shows. In Croatoan when they think Sam is about to die Dean says he’s tired. In season two that poor boy is tired of the life and wants to take a break from it. To think of all the things he hasn’t been through yet….   Don’t get me wrong I do like some parts of the later seasons. I love hoe dysfunctionally codependent Sam and Dean are and how nothing no one is worth losing the other. Not even the world. There is something about that isn’t there?   But I miss those twenty-something boys who still have humanity in them. They feel more real. There is a familiarity to their struggle - all of us have felt like bad human beings once or twice. They prank and laugh and bicker in a way that feels true. Don’t get me started on the bitch-jerk of those early times either because ARGH.   But by going bigger and more extreme every season that reality gets pushed aside. They suddenly carry the whole world’s fate on their shoulders (and Dean was already tired before he made the deal and before he knew about angels! Come on show) and that makes them harder to reach as human beings. Their struggle is so far away from normal that it loses something. It’s harder to relate to.   And that is why I will always love the early seasons. The gritty horror of people who feel real not the supernatural soap opera it turned into.,2024-07-11 12:38:48 GMT

18,Supernatural,['spn meta'],little-escapist,I’m rewatching Supernatural from the start and I may have cracked why the early seasons are so dear to me (or well there are many reasons but this is one more).   Sam and Dean are humane in a way they are not in the later years. There’s a different kind of darkness in them because there is also their humanity to counteract their job of killing: they struggle to kill (Croatoan). They feel bad when people get killed - they care about the people demons possess. They have a hard life and it shows. In Croatoan when they think Sam is about to die Dean says he’s tired. In season two that poor boy is tired of the life and wants to take a break from it. To think of all the things he hasn’t been through yet….   Don’t get me wrong I do like some parts of the later seasons. I love hoe dysfunctionally codependent Sam and Dean are and how nothing no one is worth losing the other. Not even the world. There is something about that isn’t there?   But I miss those twenty-something boys who still have humanity in them. They feel more real. There is a familiarity to their struggle - all of us have felt like bad human beings once or twice. They prank and laugh and bicker in a way that feels true. Don’t get me started on the bitch-jerk of those early times either because ARGH.   But by going bigger and more extreme every season that reality gets pushed aside. They suddenly carry the whole world’s fate on their shoulders (and Dean was already tired before he made the deal and before he knew about angels! Come on show) and that makes them harder to reach as human beings. Their struggle is so far away from normal that it loses something. It’s harder to relate to.   And that is why I will always love the early seasons. The gritty horror of people who feel real not the supernatural soap opera it turned into.,2024-07-11 12:38:48 GMT

He knew that they had come to the the right place— that Loki was here. It hadn’t been hard to narrow that down once Gabriel had opened the elevator doors and started what had practically been a shootout straight from a movie; complete with the flickering lights and all. Unless the hotel owners here took the safety of their guests very seriously there was no other explanation for why the upper floor had been crawling with armed gunmen. Not that any of the owners could probably afford gunman anyway. All the buildings Dean had passed in Baby on the way here had been sagging with old age and the one Ezra was currently prowling around in was no different.  It was too cold too ugly and too quiet for a place that was supposed to be housing the trickster of all tricksters but he figured that’s what Loki would want his pursuers to think. So he pushed on.  Ezra paused as he turned another corner realizing he had gone in a loop. Four left turns in a row. That means he should be back where he started only that wasn’t the case. Instead of the rusty elevator that he Sam Dean and Gabriel had made their grand entrance and then consequently split up from there was a nice set of pearly white doors staring him down. A part of Ezra felt calm at the sight. Like he should be opening them and stepping into whatever lay behind without a second thought. Trust me the white wood whispered. I’m your friend.  The other part of him turned around to catch Loki’s hand before he could stab him in the back.  “Whoops. You caught me.”  Ezra’s eyes widened a fraction of an inch at the carbon copy of Gabriel that stared back at him. Gabriel had said that he’d taken on Loki’s face when he’d gone into hiding from heaven but Ezra didn’t expect him to have meant that literally.  “Loki?”  “I have to hand it to you kid. You’re smarter than you look.”  Ezra’s gaze snapped down to Loki’s wrist as he felt it begin to dematerialize in his grip. Wisps of thin smoke danced in front of his eyes and suddenly the god wasn’t there anymore.  “So you are the infamous Azrael Basil.” Ezra turned his gun in the direction Loki’s voice was coming from now and it ended up somewhere over his right shoulder before he could fully turn around. Loki’s smug smile was waiting for him in the meantime mouth enclosed around a sweet treat that Ezra had seen in Gabriel’s own grasp many a times.  “Heard a lot about you.” Loki finished bringing the sucker away from his mouth with a loud pop maintaining eye contact with Ezra as he did so. The lewdness of the action made Ezra’s rough expression dip into uncertain waters for a moment before snapping back to its original state.  “Hope I’m living up to the legend.” He managed to keep his voice devoid of emotions. The barrel of his gun was set dead center at Loki’s forehead but he didn’t pull the trigger. Not yet.  “Well that’s for me to decide and for you to find out isn’t it?” Loki spread his arms with a fancy flourish a crooked smile making itself at home on his face. Twirling the sucker stick in between his fingers he plucked a black case out of thin air and opened it placing the candy alongside its brothers in one quick move.  “Is that a lollipop holster?” Ezra opened his mouth before he could think to stop and regretted asking the moment Loki’s eyes swept over him in a playful manner.  “Aren’t you the perceptive one?” He grinned scratching absentmindedly at the stubble on his chin. “Want a taste?” He shook the case in Ezra’s direction with a quirk of his eyebrow.  “No thanks.” The gun in his hands was gripped tighter. “I don’t exactly have stupid written on my forehead.”  Loki didn’t answer. His grin just got bigger.  “I’m going to ignore your silence and hope that I don’t have anything written on my face now.”  “Boo. You’re no fun.” He sighed. With a snap the case was sent away and Ezra’s muscles pulled tight at the sound.  “Relax for a moment would ya? I’m not going to kill you just yet. I’ve been dying to meet you.” Loki rolled his eyes to an invisible audience as if to say &#x27;can you believe this guy’ before unbuttoning the coat on his suit. The flaps fell away to reveal a pinstriped shirt underneath that went wonderfully with the hat placed carefully on a pile of golden curls and Ezra took a split second to look down at his own outfit with a frown. Clearly he had gone into this mission a bit underdressed if the various holes peppered in his shirt said anything.  “Oh don’t feel bad.” Loki waved his hand as if he could read Ezra’s mind. “I could snap you up some new digs in no time flat if you’d like.”  “No thanks.” Ezra resisted the urge to clear his throat clearly thrown off by the offer. “They’d just get bloody.”  “You sure?” Loki raised an eyebrow yet again. He didn’t seem very phased by the not so hidden threat.  “I could get you whatever you’d like and I’m not just talking about clothes. A smart guy like you should be able to pick up on the offer I’m laying down here.”  Silence.  “You’re going to make me do all the work for you aren’t you?” Loki groaned with a comical touch to it. “Let me break it down. Me: an age old god. Father of deception. The trickster of all tricksters. Okay got it?” He sent a look in Ezra’s direction clapping his hands happily without waiting for an answer. “And you: an extremely killable human with a bit of a habit of ending the world. Not exactly the fairest of fights now is it?”  “Something tells me you’re not looking to make this fight fair.” Ezra hummed. Loki grinned in response.  “You’re only partially right. Look I’m thinking we can help each other out.” Loki’s complacent grin rivaled that of even the best salesman in the world.  “Word on the street is you’re looking for a gateway into another reality. Now you could go about it the hard way like I know you have been or—” He held up a single finger pausing “—or you could let me help you. All I ask in return is for you to betray those thankless idiots you call friends when it’s all over. Maybe even kill one of them. A simple trade no? And you won’t even have to sell your soul.”  “Oh no I’ll just throw away a decade of comradery for some has-been with an ego. Easy peasy right?”  “No need for name calling. Here I thought we were being civil” Loki’s expressions darkened like the sky before a storm. It took him a second to get it back to a look of charm and eager promises. “Come on kiddo. You can’t tell me you’ve never thought of leaving those suckers behind. Odin knows that they’d trade you for the chance to find their mommy in a heart beat.”  Ezra felt his grip falter.  “You know I’m right.” Loki beamed. “What do you say? Let’s make a deal.”  The seconds stretched on as Ezra’s eyes searched his face. Looking for something to cling onto. A lie a truth anything at all.  He dug his feet into the carpeted floor heartily.  &quot;Interesting offer but I think I’m going to have to decline.” He sent a falsely saccharine smile Loki’s way and cocked his gun with a firm click. “I don’t make deals with douche wads.”  “Well if that’s how you’re going to be..” Loki let his sentence trail off with a sigh taking off his hat and placing it down on the hallway stand next to him haphazardly. It was a calm and collected movement and Ezra felt the tension roll off of it in waves. “Can’t say I didn’t try!”  Without so much as a warning Loki’s hand shot out and Ezra felt himself being thrown backwards as his gun went flying.  One of the hallways’ rotted walls splintered under the weight of his back as he made sudden contact with it his elbows and the heels of his feet knocking against its surface painfully. They yelped at the feeling and it was louder than they’d like to admit.  He had enough of his bearings together as he scrambled up using the wall behind him as a crutch all the while to realize that Loki didn’t even have to touch him to hurt him. A part of his brain yelled that hurting Loki wouldn’t be as easy as he thought either. That was all but confirmed as he went to take a swing at the god just for his fist to be caught in an iron grip.  Loki wiggled his eyebrows and Ezra swallowed.  This time there was nowhere behind Ezra for his body to go flying so he just hit the wall with a loud noise before sliding down the length of it again.  “You know I see a lot of myself in you.” Loki tapped his chin as he looked down at a dazed Ezra. He watched as they shakily reached for their gun that they had dropped but kicked it away at the last moment with an &#x27;ah-ah-ah’ noise. Wagging his finger at them in a no no motion wasn’t necessary but Loki took joy in the disgust Ezra displayed at the childish chiding.  “Like I said I see myself when I look at you.” Loki gripped Ezra by his jaw squishing his cheeks together as he brought the man to standing height; and then some. Ezra made a noise that could have been identical to a garbage disposal in any other situation and clawed at Loki’s hands. His fingernails left soft pink trails in their wake and it only took him a second to figure out that whatever he was doing wasn’t working.  “Ambitious dashing good looks young—” Loki cut himself off with a wistful sigh. “Okay maybe I’m stretching the young thing but you have to admit I don’t look a day over ten thousand!”  Ezra opened his mouth for a slow moment like he was about to say something. Loki raised an eyebrow and leaned in slightly possibly in an attempt to hear whatever garbled nonsense the hunter would try to get out before his teeth grit together in a cry of pain.  Ezra dropped from Loki’s hold and took little time in scrambling away. His gun had since returned to his hand at that point thanks to some sneaky shimmying and he silently thanked Sam for having the hindsight to load the weapon with well the ammo that he did. Whatever those bullets were made of they worked. At least well enough to distract a god.  Looking down Loki saw the smoking hole in one of his shoes and smelled his own blood in the air. His nostrils flared in poorly concealed anger as he barked out a harsh laugh recovering quickly while flicking his arms out to tighten the fabric of his sleeves around them.  “Oh now you’ve done it.” Loki chuckled. There was no humor behind the sound this time.  If you asked him later Ezra would tell you that he blacked out a little at that point. That the next few minutes were filled with the blur of thrown punches and heavily drawn blood. But he’d be lying.  Ezra counted every blow sent his way and every swing he took of his own. For each punch he sent in Loki’s direction twice as many were sent back. Each strategic kick was met with five more at full force beating him down until eventually Ezra got sloppy. Sloppy enough for Loki to twist behind him arm situating itself around his neck like a boa constrictor and forcing him to his knees. Ezra knelt on the carpet trapped in a headlock and struggling for air as Loki laughed.  “I know all about you Azrael.” Loki’s breath was hot and heavy along the side of Ezra’s face as he gripped his neck squeezing harder with each passing sentence. “How do you think I knew just what to offer you back there hm? Your pal Gabriel? Before I sent him away to Asmodeus? He was reallll chatty about you and your pals. You three must have made some sort of an impression on him.” His knuckles tightened in their grip spreading a ghoulish white quality across the stretched expanse of skin over them.  Ezra choked some more.  “He talked a lot about some of your deepest darkest secrets. Poor guy does feel bad for what he did to you you know. But he’d never admit it. Has to keep things professional and all that. I’m sure you understand.” Loki flashed an award winning grin. He could have been accepting an award on some stage at that moment not choking the life out of someone.  Ezra did in fact understand. That urge to have people fill in the gaps for you because once you said what you were really thinking it became true and not some urge you shoved down. He really did understand that. Or he might have if it wasn’t for the crushing pressure around his windpipe.  It took him a moment to be able to focus on anything other than the lack of air getting through to his brain and once he did he realized it was because Loki had taken a step back. Cold fingers were still wrapped around his throat hard enough to keep him on his knees but at least Ezra didn’t feel like he was being suffocated anymore.  “You talk too much.” He wheezed. It was a barely audible sound but he could practically feel the way Loki’s face soured.  “I know how left behind you feel Ezra. How left behind you are. I know that you’d do anything to have the connection that Dean and Sam do with somebody. That’s why you give so many people second chances isn’t it? Crowley Castiel Rowena and now even our own little Gabriel. When will you learn Ezra. You’re damaged goods. Not even second rate. Try third. It’s just sad at this point.”  To punctuate his sentence Loki sent a punch straight at Ezra’s nose. His head snapped back with a sickening crack hitting the stained wallpaper behind him with too much force to be okay. Something wet and bitter tasting filled the cavern of his mouth slowly and Ezra knew without having to feel around that he’d bit off a chunk of his tongue. That was going to be a bitch to heal later; if there even was a later.  “I mean really what did you think you were going to do to me hm?” Loki made a sucking noise with his teeth and rolled his eyes. “You’re supposed to be the one with common sense! Sure the four of you knuckle draggers come in here kill my sons and then me blah blah blah. But coming after me all by yourself? Rookie mistake killer.”  It was tough for Ezra to pull it together enough to lift his head up. His movements felt sluggish— like he was surrounded in a thick layer of molasses. But he managed situating his head upright enough to get a good look at Loki’s face.  “I really must have done a number on you if you’re smiling at a time like this.” Loki mirrored Ezra’s toothy grin with a condescending air albeit his a little less bloody than the other man’s.  “Nope.” Ezra laughed with a high pitch to it some blood spraying out of his mouth in a fine mist at the action. “Just happy to have a front row seat.”  Loki barely had enough time to realize what Ezra meant before Gabriel was on him pulling the trickster away from Ezra and throwing him across the small room. Sam and Dean poured into the hallway soon after the former wasting no time in crouching down to drape Ezra’s arm around his shoulders and then away from the fight while Dean shuffled alongside them with a limp of his own.  Sam asked them a question and then asked it again in a louder tone when Ezra didn’t respond. He was too busy watching the fight between Loki and Gabriel as they circled each other. The energy radiating off of them reminded Ezra of an alley cat fight only if the alley cats were two superpowered beings that shared the same face. But like before with Loki it was his words that really caught Ezra’s attention more than anything. Specifically the way they were directed as Gabriel with such deadly force and accuracy.  “Poor Gabriel. With his dead beat Daddy and his mean older brothers.”  A kick was sent to Gabriel’s ribs. He was sprawled on the floor now caught off guard at some point in the stand off. Sam and Dean only watched. They knew better than to get involved in this fight.. They all knew that Gabriel had come here to kill Loki on his own even if that meant he got hurt in the process. Or worse.  “Who will help me! Who will save me!” Loki mocked Gabriel cruelly.  Another kick.  “I did.” Loki’s voice contained nothing but pure rage as he pulled a similar move on Gabriel like the one he had done with Ezra earlier. The archangel’s toes skimmed the ground as he was hoisted in the air by his coat lapels nose brushing against Loki’s similarly shaped one.  “But you couldn’t keep one single promise. And then you had the audacity to ask me to help you? Again?” They tumbled backward in a streak of furious red and black.  Ezra found he could no longer see either Gabriel or Loki over Sam’s height so he shifted in his grip to catch sight of the two of them again stopping only when Sam squeezed him around the middle. A sign to hold still.  “You think I deserve to die for your spinelessness?” They heard Loki all but spit. His face was red and his finely combed hair was now frizzed up like a madman’s no doubt having been mussed up in one of the two fights he had picked this evening. “That my sons deserve to die?”  Gabriel was shoved into another wall yet again.  “Of course.” Loki licked his lips lowering his voice to a timbre that only Gabriel could hear. “Of course you would need someone to swoop in and save your pitiful ass.”  “Shut up.” Gabriel managed to get those two words unlodged from his throat only to have Loki toss him away once again. Ezra had a fleeting thought that he could have been the god of throwing people across the room in another life but his attempt at humor was lost even on himself.  The two grappled for one more moment until eventually when the dust settled it was Gabriel that had the upper hand this time. His left palm was digging into Loki’s chest keeping him in place as the wooden sword he’d brought to the battle lay digging into Loki’s front. A promise of what was to come.  “Face it old friend.” Even with the threat of death looming over him Loki couldn’t shut up. Fueled by an anger like no other he continued. “You’re a joke. You’re a failure. You live for pleasure and you stand for nothing.” Loki’s eyes flickered over to Ezra and the Winchester’s at that. “And in the end? That’s exactly what you’ll die for.”  Nobody said anything as Gabriel stared into eyes that were an exact replica of his own right down to the rage and fear that threatened to boil over at all times.  “You first.” Gabriel whispered.  Loki’s body slid off of the end of the katana as Gabriel pulled it back. It slumped to the floor in a lifeless heap; an uneventful end to a very rough fight.  The archangel didn’t turn to look over at the audience he’d collected for a long while and when he did it was only to nod. A sign that it was over. Loki was really dead and that he had completed what he’d set out to do.  “Come on we should go.” Dean’s voice was gruff with the command but nobody moved. It was like they were all under some sort of spell watching Gabriel with bated breath as his eyes flickered to Ezra’s.  “Loki. He offered you everything you’re fighting for. All you had to do was betray me.” Gabriel hesitated with his words for a moment. He licked his lips almost nervously. “Why didn’t you?”  Ezra saw Sam and Dean look at him from the corner of his eye in a confused motion. He inhaled sharply. Ezra wasn’t all that surprised that Gabriel had overheard what he and Loki had been talking about— in fact he would go out of his way to say that Gabriel had heard the whole damn thing —but knowing and actually talking about what had been said was a whole other thing.  They winced as they pulled themself up to their full height making a noise of pain in the process they hoped was quiet enough to pass as a weird sigh. Judging on the concerned face Dean pulled it didn’t.  “Not that I owe it to you to explain myself but—” He cut Gabriel off from whatever he was about to say with a stern look “—you of all people should understand. Family sucks right? You said it yourself. I lost mine a long time ago so I got my friends instead.” He stopped to look at Sam who was still letting Ezra hang off of him. Somewhere else in the hallway he knew Dean was listening too and spoke a little louder so he could be able to hear.  “Even if they’re stupid sometimes or a lot of the time they’re all I know. Betraying them would be like betraying the only people around that still have my back. And like I told that little shit Loki earlier I don’t exactly have stupid written on my face.”  A pregnant pause filled the room following his words. Ezra watched as an array of emotions flickered across everyone faces; from pride and relief on Sam’s face to a steely but quiet respect on Gabriel’s. Ezra was sure he was displaying some of his own in the moment and took a shaky breath.  There was another moment of comfortable silence before Dean broke it.  “Hey Ez? Listen about the whole stupid not being written on your face thing—”  Ezra jerked his arm away from Sam as his hand flew up to touch his forehead. Pulling it back he found black ink staining the tips of his fingertips and let out a strangled noise of anger.  “Oh come on!”  Gabriel’s face broke out into a smile as Dean laughed heartily. With red ears Ezra threw his hands up. The pain in his body was too busy being masked with embarrassment for him to care.  “Was anybody going to tell me that or were you all just going to let me walk out into the street looking like this!?”  “Well I mean your hair covers most of it—”  “Gabriel don’t finish that sentence.” Sam closed his eyes and laughed like he couldn’t believe the conversation he was having. “We’ll get you cleaned up back in the car Ezra. For now let’s get out of here before police respond to a call about gunshots.”  With a reluctant grumble Ezra pulled the front of his beanie down further bringing it to the top of his eyebrows and hoping that did enough to cover the black writing.  “I really hope that asshole didn’t make it permanent.”  “Oh you have to let me get a picture if that’s true.”  “So help me god I will kill you Dean—”,2024-07-11 16:03:43 GMT

Series Masterlist   Summary: Y/N was just told by Sam that cooties aren’t real so she thought it would be funny to bother Dean about it.     Y/N is 7 years old Sam is 7 years old Dean is 11 years old.     BASED ON:     The Old Testament Series.     Genesis Primis: A Supernatural Rewrite (Dean Winchester x Reader) by @dianawinchester03      (Remember that they are KIDS it’s just a harmless innocent peck)     💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋     &lt;!-- more --&gt;   “No way!” Y/N exclaimed in surprise her palms pressed to her cheeks. “Yes way! Sally-Ray told me!” Sam giggled mischievously “But Daddy told me they were nasty and boys carried them” Y/N laughed. “Nuh-uh” Sam shook his head “But how are you so sure…” Y/N narrowed her eyes at Sam his cheeks flushed pink. Then realization dawned on her      “YOU DIDNT!” She pushed him slightly earning a cheeky smile from Sam. “You had your first kiss Sammyyyy. Luckkyyy” Y/N cooed “What’s going on in here?” Dean walked in through the front door to see Sam and Y/N gossiping on the couch Bobby was in the kitchen making breakfast for them while Dean was out playing in the yard.     “Sammy just told me cooties aren’t real!” Y/N giggled “You snitch that was supposed to me a secret” Sam gasped whispering to her. “I’m sure he already knows” She whispered back both looking over to Dean who had a puzzled and dumbfounded look on his face. “H-he’s lying” Dean stuttered walking in to rest his action figure down on the coffee table.     Y/N and her best friend shared a mischievous look “Charmingggg…..tag you’re it!” She shoved Dean lightly before running out into the yard Dean laughed loudly running behind his friend. “Be careful you little idjits! Or your daddies are gonna have my head if you get hurt” Bobby called out from the kitchen waving his spatula an apron wrapped around his beer gut with one hand propped on his hip as he flipped the pancakes. Y/N ran past him through the back door.     “Come ‘mere princess I’m not gonna hurt you!” Dean laughed chasing after her. Y/N’s little feet could only carry her so far. So Dean caught up to her tapping her on your shoulder “You’re it!” Dean giggled y/n smiled widely and Deans face dropped “Oh no you don’t!” He stuttered running away as she chased after him “Come onnn Dean I know cooties aren’t real anymore” She chased after him Dean was heavy on his feet.      The breath in his lungs slowly diminished as tire took him over. He crouched behind one of the old scrap cars peering up slightly to make sure she wasn’t around. He realized he was dead wrong when a little girl tackled him using the moves her daddy thought her “I caught you!” Y/N giggled “Not fair! You’re not supposed to tackle in tag” Dean defended as he got up from the ground dusting himself off.     “Snooze you lose charming” She smiled widely outstretching her hand for Dean to help her up. Dean took her hand without hesitation only to be pulled to the floor again. “Oof!” Dean exclaimed with a laugh as he hit the floor with a thud. “0-2” Y/N teased. “Seriously princess not fair!” Dean exclaimed crossing his arms with a pout. “Awww don’t be a sour loser” She reached over to pat his head.     Both still sprawled out on the ground “Hey Dean? Is it true? Are cooties really not real?” Y/N asked curiously as they both pushed themselves up dusting their hands. “I don’t know” Dean mumbled shrugging. “I haven’t kissed anyone” His head dropped in a bit of shame “It’s okay I haven’t either” Y/N assured her friend and then an idea crossed her mind.     “Hey why don’t we do it??” She smiled brightly the innocence protruding off of her. Deans jaw dropped gulping slightly “W-what?” His eyes widen “You know? We are friends and I trust you. I wouldn’t want it to be with anyone else…unless you want it to be someone else” She pouted a bit not feeling stupid for suggesting it. “No no. It’s not that…I just thought you and Sam liked each other” Dean pulled his knees to his chest.     “No! Ew no way” Y/N exclaimed with a light laugh “Sam’s like my brother he’s annoying. And you’re you” she smiled with a little shrug looking at him in an endearing manner. Dean couldn’t help the way she made his heart flutter especially when she complimented him. “Are you sure you would want to do it with me?” He asked nervously a small smile on his lips as he moved closer to her.     Deans heart fluttered in his chest as the air outside suddenly felt more dense. They were sitting inches apart as she looked down at the ground picking at the grass. The idea of kissing her had crossed his mind many times but they were so young. It’s not like they’d actually go ahead with it right? Wrong.     He gulped looking up at her pouting it’s not that he didn’t want to it was just the fear of ruining what they already had. Meanwhile Y/N was trying not to giggle she had the world’s biggest crush on Dean and she doesn’t even know what a crush is. All she knows is that he’s her friend and she likes him. If you were to ask her who Dean is to her she’d say he’s her friend whom she loves dearly as her own family.     “Yeah” Y/N found herself replying her voice barely above a whisper. Dean looked down at her his eyes widening slightly. “Yeah?” He repeated in a higher pitched tone as if she’d change his mind. Then a grin pulled at both their lips lips “Yeah” She replied firmly sitting up a bit straighter. He couldn’t believe he was agreeing to this they were children. And the fact they’re out in the open only made it feel even more taboo.     “Okay” She replied softly her cheeks turning a shade of light pink. She leaned forward moving closer to him. “Okay” Dean mimicked nodding his head slightly. They both chuckled nervously neither had ever done anything like it before. It wasn’t like their parents would know they’d done it and they would only be their first and only kiss after all right?     Y/N smiled her heart rate picking up immensely as he confirmed with her “Wait” She stopped pulling her head back. “But don’t tell daddy or uncle John. Promise?” She asked putting out her pinky finger. Dean intertwined his pinky finger with hers “I promise” he smiled back gulping slightly. Dean could feel his heart beat out of his chest it felt like a wave of heat took over his body as he leaned a little closer to her.     They were now sitting cross legged behind the scrapped car both nervous wrecks. His eyes looked down to her lips his own a small distance away. “What if one of them finds out?” He whispered in a shy shaky Ear tone. This seemed like a big deal for both of them considering they would be each other’s first kiss.     Her big (e/c) eyes looked up into his her cheeks now dusted in a warm tint of pink. “Don’t worry they won’t” she replied trying to keep her voice steady and confident but in reality she was the spitting image of nervousness.     “Yeah you’re right” he replied breathlessly with a nervous smile. He found himself looking down at her pretty pink lips then back up into her shining eyes which were staring intently into his. Y/N took the initiative and leaned in.      Dean swallowed hard as his eyes widened when he saw her inching closer to him he subconsciously parted his lips awaiting the feeling of her lips on his. His palms began to sweat and his head started to spin out of nerves.     Slowly he felt those soft lips make contact with his own. He couldn’t move for a brief second but soon enough he eased into the kiss and closed his eyes. The peck didn’t last long but it was enough to have them both swooning. Y/N was beet red when she pulled away having experienced her first kiss with none-other than Dean Winchester. “Kids?! Breakfast is ready!” Bobby yelled from the house both of them froze.     “Uh oh..” Dean whispered looking around. They were both still blushing the warmth between them almost felt electrifying. They quickly composed themselves pushing up from the ground to see Bobby standing on the back porch through the broken car window beckoning the children to come eat. “Coming!” Dean yelled back grabbing Y/N’s shaky hand.     Her heart was still fluttering as they both made their way back into the house. They sat down at the table and looked at one another with flushed cheeks both knowing the secret sitting between them. But they knew it wasn’t one that was gonna leave either of their mouths to another. They trusted each other and that trust would never break. Not in a million years.     “So how was tag?” Sam chimed in innocently taking a bite of his bacon. The question snapped them back into reality and they quickly turned their heads to face Sam. “Good&quot; Dean responded a little too fast with a nervous chuckle &quot;Y-yeah… it was…it was good” Y/N said hesitantly shoving food into her mouth avoiding the older brothers gaze.     Bobby was too focused on eating his food but Sam noticed the difference almost immediately. He raised a questioning eyebrow and looked between the two children. “You guys alright?” He asked with a mouthful of bacon. “Sammy not eating with your mouth full” Bobby reprimanded him with a slight chuckle handing him a tissue.     “Yeah yeah!” They both simultaneously replied a little too quickly. There was a beat of silence before Dean quickly thought of a new topic to change the subject “So uh.. Sam did you see that new Godzilla movie yet?” He asked casually avoiding any eye contact.     Sam noticed this and couldn’t help but think something seemed off. His eyes darted between the two friends noticing their flushed faces and how they were avoiding eye contact with one another completely. He could sense the tension between them like they were keeping something to themselves. He just couldn’t put his finger on it.     Sam just shrugged it off digging into his eggs “Yeah I did. It was pretty good” He said as he continued to eat his eyes flickered back up to the pair. He couldn’t help feeling a bit suspicious. Something was definitely going on between them. He could tell by the way they were avoiding eye contact and their flushed cheeks.     Dean tried to hide his nervous expression but Sam could see through it. Sam with y/n they knew his brother and best friend like the back of his hand since he could talk. Sam made a mental note to keep an eye on them.     💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋  ________________________________        Authors Note: Another reminder they are KIDS.

Going into this show with no knowledge except that gleaned from The Day (Nov. 5th 2020) and surrounding events I assumed that the whole “this is a story” meta nonsense was out of left field that it was an S15 plot they pulled out because they’d run out of places to escalate to. No! That’s possibly the most well-supported endgame this show could possibly have gone to I think. They’re all in on the show as a construction and we’re hardly into the 2010s.

Series Masterlist   Summary: Y/N was just told by Sam that cooties aren’t real so she thought it would be funny to bother Dean about it.     Y/N is 7 years old Sam is 7 years old Dean is 11 years old.     BASED ON:     The Old Testament Series.     Genesis Primis: A Supernatural Rewrite (Dean Winchester x Reader) by @dianawinchester03      (Remember that they are KIDS it’s just a harmless innocent peck)     💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋     &lt;!-- more --&gt;   “No way!” Y/N exclaimed in surprise her palms pressed to her cheeks. “Yes way! Sally-Ray told me!” Sam giggled mischievously “But Daddy told me they were nasty and boys carried them” Y/N laughed. “Nuh-uh” Sam shook his head “But how are you so sure…” Y/N narrowed her eyes at Sam his cheeks flushed pink. Then realization dawned on her      “YOU DIDNT!” She pushed him slightly earning a cheeky smile from Sam. “You had your first kiss Sammyyyy. Luckkyyy” Y/N cooed “What’s going on in here?” Dean walked in through the front door to see Sam and Y/N gossiping on the couch Bobby was in the kitchen making breakfast for them while Dean was out playing in the yard.     “Sammy just told me cooties aren’t real!” Y/N giggled “You snitch that was supposed to me a secret” Sam gasped whispering to her. “I’m sure he already knows” She whispered back both looking over to Dean who had a puzzled and dumbfounded look on his face. “H-he’s lying” Dean stuttered walking in to rest his action figure down on the coffee table.     Y/N and her best friend shared a mischievous look “Charmingggg…..tag you’re it!” She shoved Dean lightly before running out into the yard Dean laughed loudly running behind his friend. “Be careful you little idjits! Or your daddies are gonna have my head if you get hurt” Bobby called out from the kitchen waving his spatula an apron wrapped around his beer gut with one hand propped on his hip as he flipped the pancakes. Y/N ran past him through the back door.     “Come ‘mere princess I’m not gonna hurt you!” Dean laughed chasing after her. Y/N’s little feet could only carry her so far. So Dean caught up to her tapping her on your shoulder “You’re it!” Dean giggled y/n smiled widely and Deans face dropped “Oh no you don’t!” He stuttered running away as she chased after him “Come onnn Dean I know cooties aren’t real anymore” She chased after him Dean was heavy on his feet.      The breath in his lungs slowly diminished as tire took him over. He crouched behind one of the old scrap cars peering up slightly to make sure she wasn’t around. He realized he was dead wrong when a little girl tackled him using the moves her daddy thought her “I caught you!” Y/N giggled “Not fair! You’re not supposed to tackle in tag” Dean defended as he got up from the ground dusting himself off.     “Snooze you lose charming” She smiled widely outstretching her hand for Dean to help her up. Dean took her hand without hesitation only to be pulled to the floor again. “Oof!” Dean exclaimed with a laugh as he hit the floor with a thud. “0-2” Y/N teased. “Seriously princess not fair!” Dean exclaimed crossing his arms with a pout. “Awww don’t be a sour loser” She reached over to pat his head.     Both still sprawled out on the ground “Hey Dean? Is it true? Are cooties really not real?” Y/N asked curiously as they both pushed themselves up dusting their hands. “I don’t know” Dean mumbled shrugging. “I haven’t kissed anyone” His head dropped in a bit of shame “It’s okay I haven’t either” Y/N assured her friend and then an idea crossed her mind.     “Hey why don’t we do it??” She smiled brightly the innocence protruding off of her. Deans jaw dropped gulping slightly “W-what?” His eyes widen “You know? We are friends and I trust you. I wouldn’t want it to be with anyone else…unless you want it to be someone else” She pouted a bit not feeling stupid for suggesting it. “No no. It’s not that…I just thought you and Sam liked each other” Dean pulled his knees to his chest.     “No! Ew no way” Y/N exclaimed with a light laugh “Sam’s like my brother he’s annoying. And you’re you” she smiled with a little shrug looking at him in an endearing manner. Dean couldn’t help the way she made his heart flutter especially when she complimented him. “Are you sure you would want to do it with me?” He asked nervously a small smile on his lips as he moved closer to her.     Deans heart fluttered in his chest as the air outside suddenly felt more dense. They were sitting inches apart as she looked down at the ground picking at the grass. The idea of kissing her had crossed his mind many times but they were so young. It’s not like they’d actually go ahead with it right? Wrong.     He gulped looking up at her pouting it’s not that he didn’t want to it was just the fear of ruining what they already had. Meanwhile Y/N was trying not to giggle she had the world’s biggest crush on Dean and she doesn’t even know what a crush is. All she knows is that he’s her friend and she likes him. If you were to ask her who Dean is to her she’d say he’s her friend whom she loves dearly as her own family.     “Yeah” Y/N found herself replying her voice barely above a whisper. Dean looked down at her his eyes widening slightly. “Yeah?” He repeated in a higher pitched tone as if she’d change his mind. Then a grin pulled at both their lips lips “Yeah” She replied firmly sitting up a bit straighter. He couldn’t believe he was agreeing to this they were children. And the fact they’re out in the open only made it feel even more taboo.     “Okay” She replied softly her cheeks turning a shade of light pink. She leaned forward moving closer to him. “Okay” Dean mimicked nodding his head slightly. They both chuckled nervously neither had ever done anything like it before. It wasn’t like their parents would know they’d done it and they would only be their first and only kiss after all right?     Y/N smiled her heart rate picking up immensely as he confirmed with her “Wait” She stopped pulling her head back. “But don’t tell daddy or uncle John. Promise?” She asked putting out her pinky finger. Dean intertwined his pinky finger with hers “I promise” he smiled back gulping slightly. Dean could feel his heart beat out of his chest it felt like a wave of heat took over his body as he leaned a little closer to her.     They were now sitting cross legged behind the scrapped car both nervous wrecks. His eyes looked down to her lips his own a small distance away. “What if one of them finds out?” He whispered in a shy shaky Ear tone. This seemed like a big deal for both of them considering they would be each other’s first kiss.     Her big (e/c) eyes looked up into his her cheeks now dusted in a warm tint of pink. “Don’t worry they won’t” she replied trying to keep her voice steady and confident but in reality she was the spitting image of nervousness.     “Yeah you’re right” he replied breathlessly with a nervous smile. He found himself looking down at her pretty pink lips then back up into her shining eyes which were staring intently into his. Y/N took the initiative and leaned in.      Dean swallowed hard as his eyes widened when he saw her inching closer to him he subconsciously parted his lips awaiting the feeling of her lips on his. His palms began to sweat and his head started to spin out of nerves.     Slowly he felt those soft lips make contact with his own. He couldn’t move for a brief second but soon enough he eased into the kiss and closed his eyes. The peck didn’t last long but it was enough to have them both swooning. Y/N was beet red when she pulled away having experienced her first kiss with none-other than Dean Winchester. “Kids?! Breakfast is ready!” Bobby yelled from the house both of them froze.     “Uh oh..” Dean whispered looking around. They were both still blushing the warmth between them almost felt electrifying. They quickly composed themselves pushing up from the ground to see Bobby standing on the back porch through the broken car window beckoning the children to come eat. “Coming!” Dean yelled back grabbing Y/N’s shaky hand.     Her heart was still fluttering as they both made their way back into the house. They sat down at the table and looked at one another with flushed cheeks both knowing the secret sitting between them. But they knew it wasn’t one that was gonna leave either of their mouths to another. They trusted each other and that trust would never break. Not in a million years.     “So how was tag?” Sam chimed in innocently taking a bite of his bacon. The question snapped them back into reality and they quickly turned their heads to face Sam. “Good&quot; Dean responded a little too fast with a nervous chuckle &quot;Y-yeah… it was…it was good” Y/N said hesitantly shoving food into her mouth avoiding the older brothers gaze.     Bobby was too focused on eating his food but Sam noticed the difference almost immediately. He raised a questioning eyebrow and looked between the two children. “You guys alright?” He asked with a mouthful of bacon. “Sammy not eating with your mouth full” Bobby reprimanded him with a slight chuckle handing him a tissue.     “Yeah yeah!” They both simultaneously replied a little too quickly. There was a beat of silence before Dean quickly thought of a new topic to change the subject “So uh.. Sam did you see that new Godzilla movie yet?” He asked casually avoiding any eye contact.     Sam noticed this and couldn’t help but think something seemed off. His eyes darted between the two friends noticing their flushed faces and how they were avoiding eye contact with one another completely. He could sense the tension between them like they were keeping something to themselves. He just couldn’t put his finger on it.     Sam just shrugged it off digging into his eggs “Yeah I did. It was pretty good” He said as he continued to eat his eyes flickered back up to the pair. He couldn’t help feeling a bit suspicious. Something was definitely going on between them. He could tell by the way they were avoiding eye contact and their flushed cheeks.     Dean tried to hide his nervous expression but Sam could see through it. Sam with y/n they knew his brother and best friend like the back of his hand since he could talk. Sam made a mental note to keep an eye on them.     💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋  ________________________________        Authors Note: Another reminder they are KIDS.

Story - Did I ever tell you how I gripped you tight and raised you from perdition? Pairing - Castiel/Dean Winchester  Rating - Mature  Word Count - 1867  Summary - After they save Cas from the empty he and Dean start a relationship. On their wedding night Castiel decides to recount the story of how he pulled Dean from hell and how he fell in love with the righteous man he was destined to save.  “You remember my first words to you in the barn?” Castiel asked arms around Dean as he lay resting on him. They had just made love for the first time after their wedding an affair so small that they only had the priest for the service and Sam as a witness. He made scarce not long after knowing from their looks that Cas and Dean wanted to go to the nice hotel they booked and consummate their marriage.  Not that they hadn’t been consummating their relationship for a long time.  Fatigue was pulling at his mind as he rested his head on the warm man behind him. He wanted nothing more than to sleep but his curiosity was now piqued. Keen to see where Cas was going with this. He turned his neck cheek resting on his husbands pec so he could get a better look at him. Cas chuckled at the look of confusion clouding those gorgeous green eyes. He leant down tenderly taking his husbands lips in his own. Smiling when they broke apart moments later.  “The first time we met?” Dean replied unconsciously grabbing Castiel’s left hand pulling it in front of him and placing gentle kisses on his knuckles before pulling away and examining the ring finger. Where there now lay a simple but elegant white gold ring. He couldn’t believe after 12 long years and after almost losing one another forever when Cas was taken by the empty that they had made the commitment to love each other for the rest of their lives. Dean kissed his hand tenderly again before draping it around his chest until it rested on his shoulder. Sagging even further into the grip of his husband.  This was the happiest he had ever been in his life.  “Yes the first time we met. In the barn after I saved you from hell.” He was shifting from underneath him now manoeuvring them so they were laying side by side facing one another. Cas clasped Deans ring hand and pulled it to his heart enjoying the feeling of the slightly warm gold against his chest. A broad smile adorned his face recounting the memory in his mind as if it was a happy one.  When Dean looked back at that time all he could remember was the fear as he was faced with this unknown entity claiming to be an Angel of the Lord. An entity that could turn the eyes of a human into liquid with just one look; that could make somebodies ears bleed just by trying to talk to them. An entity that would bring his wings out as a show of intimidation behind him. Fear at being told his raising from the pit had been a command from God himself.   He had to admit though that little confused head tilt was the most adorable thing he’d ever seen.  “What about them my sweetheart?” With their new position he could now run his hands softly up his husbands sides enjoying the small whines he was eliciting from his loves lips. Before Cas answered he leant down and kissed Dean tenderly.  “Did I ever tell you how I gripped you tight and raised you from perdition?” Those words still had an effect on Dean that made him shiver. They rarely spoke about his time in hell or how Cas saved him. For years he was plagued by nightmares of his tenure there. How he went from tortured to torturer slicing pieces of souls for his tormentors for Alastair the demon that took him under his wing. As time passed the nightmares faded but he still didn’t want to discuss what he did how his actions were the start of the apocalypse. When he and Cas begun a relationship some of the nightmares returned. His brain associating his lover with that traumatic moment in his life. When he awoke from them screaming Cas held him close murmured words of love and comfort until he would fall back asleep. His patience and love got him through and that’s why he knew he would get through this conversation.  He shook his head bringing his hand up to his left shoulder lamenting the loss of the handprint a mark of claim from the man he loved. Castiel smiled softly bringing his arms around Deans waist running his hand up his lower back softly to indicate it would be okay.  “When I found you in hell I expected to find you on the torture racks. It shocked me to see you had submit to Alastair and had now become the torturer.” Dean hid his face in shame at the words only lifting his eyes when Cas pulled his chin up. They had never broached this subject before and Dean feared how his husband would see him. But those beautiful blue eyes showed nothing but understanding and love. He swallowed his shame down when Cas bought his hand up to cup his cheek. Smiling to show him that they could get through this. Everything would be okay.  He believed him.  “I remember approaching your soul. Angel blade in hand ready to fight any demon that stood in my way. But none did they submitted. A surprising turn of events considering how many of my brethren I lost on the way to finding you.” There was a small look of grief on his face. Wanting to comfort him Dean moved forward and pressed a soft kiss to those lips he loved so much. Reaching up and lacing his fingers around the hand still laying on his cheek. He nodded a silent indication Cas should continue. “When I got to you. I saw a haunted man who had been broken. One who had picked up the knife in a bid to stop their own pain. You claimed you enjoyed hurting other souls but nothing in your eyes suggested that to me at the time. Those green eyes still spoke of hope. They were a light in that terrible darkness.”   Unconsciously Dean had drifted closer to Cas now resting his head on his chest as he listened to his husbands words. He let out a shaky breath waiting for Cas to continue.  “Alastair was there by your side with that twisted smile on his face. As I stood pleading with you to come with me he laughed and goaded me. You told me you didn’t deserve to be saved you were at home in hell and these were your kind now. I was resolute though I was not leaving without you. Not when I had come so far and lost so much in my mission to save you.  “There was a shift when Alastair realised I wasn’t going to leave empty handed. The demons who had stood by and let me through now advanced on me. There were too many for me to take down at once. I managed to ‘gank’ a few as you would say.” Dean snorted with laughter imagining his husbands dorky little air quotes as he said the word gank causing Cas to grin a little before continuing his story.  “I knew if I didn’t take action I would be lost in the depths of hell an unsatisfactory place for an Angel. I grabbed your wrist but you wrenched away from my grasp hissing in pain and demanding I leave as you didn’t deserve to be saved.  “Lost and out of ideas I got close enough. Pulling your back to my chest running my arm over just below your neck and gripping your left shoulder in my hand.” As he recounted the way he held him in hell Cas started to mirror it in real life. Turning his husband so his back was nestled against his chest his arm across his body. When he placed his hand over the left shoulder Dean gasped. It was psychological he was sure but when Cas touched him there an incredible pleasure would shoot up his body. Like a spark of electricity. He felt feather light kisses against his neck and shoulder causing him to groan softly and move to give Cas more room.  “As I held you close your soul reached out to my grace. It was as if we were a perfect balance of one another yin and yang. It was that moment I wanted you all to myself Dean. I didn’t care if you had a higher purpose as Michaels vessel I just wanted to claim you as my own. I had never felt so complete with another being.” He growled biting down a little on Deans neck causing the ex-hunter to moan in delight. He loved when Cas became all possessive.  “I clutched you tight to my chest and flew you out of the pit. Leaving behind the screams of Alastair and his demon flock. During the ascent your head lulled back and you stared at me with those gorgeous green eyes with a look of awe and love.” Reflecting Cas’s words Deans head lulled back against his husbands shoulder who bought his free hand up to tenderly grab his chin. “This look this is the moment I knew our bond was profound and you could feel it to.” He caressed Deans lips with his own briefly before finishing his story.  “Once we got to Earth I repaired your damaged body and soul. But that hand print my one of claim I couldn’t bare to heal it at that moment. I needed those in heaven on earth and in hell to know that you Dean Winchester were mine and mine alone. And today I finally made good on that promise.” There was a snarl in his voice as he bent down and nipped at Deans neck again causing him to gasp eyes fluttering shut enjoying the sensation of his husband running his lips down his neck and shoulder. He felt a hand dance down his abs towards his interested member not caring they had finished making love less than an hour ago.  “I have loved you from that moment in hell when I wrapped you in my arms and I will love you for the rest of eternity. On Earth; and in heaven.” Emotions had gotten the better of Dean small tears started to fall down his cheeks. He laughed slightly before wiping them away turning his head again once he had.  “I am always thankful you’re the one who saved me. I will love you for eternity to my Angel.” He whispered before they kissed passionately knowing this kiss was only going one way. All thoughts of fatigue had been wiped from Deans mind wanting to feel connected to his Angel in every way possible.  After that confession they made love multiple times throughout the night. In between kissing and touching one another unable to be apart for too long.  It wasn’t until the next morning Dean thought through those words again and confessed the secret he had been holding for 12 years.  When he looked into Cas’s eyes for the first time whilst being raised in that moment he realised he had already fallen in love with him.  He had always loved his Angel and he would for all eternity.,2024-07-11 19:59:58 GMT

Mechanic Dean x Reader  Chapter Summary: Dean and Y/N have their first date and Dean shows who he really is.  Series Masterlist here!! &amp; Main masterlist here!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; I woke up and glanced at the clock a frown creasing my face when I saw it was almost noon.   There was a time when I’d rise early whip up breakfast for Andrew and I followed by a job and enjoying coffee at the diner. I used to think that our relationship was so normal. You know like those housewives on TV who seemed so content. But that was just among the surface.  I didn’t realize how unnatural our relationship was-the yelling the screaming the constant bullying. Now that I’m finally out of it I see those things for what they were: toxic.  It wasn’t normal for my fiance to explode if dinner wasn’t ready to check my texts and calls every night or to be upset and physically punish me when I had an idea of my own. It took me months to realize that these weren’t normal relationship dynamics; they were signs of something deeply unhealthy.   What scares me the most is that Andrew was my only experience with relationships and now with Dean showing interest I wasn’t sure how I should behave around him. Is it okay to feel this strongly about him so soon? Will he think less of me because I don’t know what a real healthy relationship is?  As if fate was responding my phone rang on the nightstand displaying an unknown number. I hesitated briefly before answering and holding it to my ear.  “Hello?”  “Hey sweetheart it’s Dean.”  Instantly my worries melted away. There was something about him something magical almost because just hearing his voice made me feel better.  “Hey Dean what’s up?”  “I was just wondering if we are still on for tonight? Instead of dinner I thought maybe I could take you somewhere.”  A rush of questions and insecurities flooded my mind. Maybe he didn’t want to be seen with me after yesterday or maybe he wanted to cancel but didn’t know how to tell me.“  &quot;Y/N? You there?”  “Oh sorry yeah if that’s what you want to do. I mean obviously its your decision.”  There was a pause and anxiety started to creep in. Had I said the wrong thing?   He chuckled into the phone “Uh I’m glad your thinking of me Y/N but this is our date. I just wanted to bring you somewhere special. You can have an opinion you know?” His laugh was reassuring and I giggled in return.   Of course he was a gentleman on top of everything else.  “I think that sounds amazing. What time should I be ready for?”  “How does 5:30 sound?”  I smiled to myself “Sounds good. See you later Dean.”  With that I hung up and placed my phone back on the nightstand. A sigh of contentment escaped me as I thought about tonight. Perhaps this would be the night things changed for me.   Dean seemed like a genuinely nice guy he hadn’t judged me during the incident with Andrew. Maybe he was different from other men.  But as I thought about tonight my nerves started getting the better of me. What would I wear? Dean hadn’t specified if it was a fancy or casual outing. Not getting a clear instruction always made me anxious-I’ve made that mistake before.  i grabbed my phone and started typing a message then hesitated deleted it and finally sent it. He responded almost immediately.  I smiled to myself as I read through the messages repeatedly. It was tempting to remain in bed reading them but I knew I had to get up and start my day before my date later tonight.  As I made my way to my suitcase I frowned realizing I had fewer clothes than expected; half of my stuff was still at Andrew’s place and I had no intention of going back there.  Unfortunately I had to go shopping. I threw on my coat grabbed my purse and headed out sitting in the car debating where to go. There was a nearby clothing store but what if Andrew had talked to the staff and made things awkward there? There was another option out of town but it was quite a distance.  My phone rang and I couldn’t help but laugh seeing Dean’s name. I answered quickly. “Can’t stay away huh?”  He chuckled deeply. “You caught me. Missed you already! But I might need to push our date back an hour. Got stuck at work until 5:30 now instead of 4. Is it okay if I pick you up at 6:30?“  “No worries that’s fine” I replied.  “What are you up to today?” He questioned with a smile I could hear.  I debated whether to be vague or share. Part of me wanted to tell him about my day; strangely he seemed genuinely interested. “Just going shopping. Turns out I need more clothes than I thought.”  “Well have fun! Where are you headed?”  “Probably the next town over. I know there are a few shops there.”  He paused for a moment and my heart skipped a beat. “Oh that’s quite a journey. You must really like those stores” he teased.  I nervously giggled playing with my coat zipper. “Not really. Andrew has stirred up a lot of drama around here and I prefer to avoid it.”  He sighed audibly his concern evident even through the phone. &quot;Sweetheart stay right there. I’ll bring something to help you out.”  I chuckled softly biting my lip. “Okay. I’ll wait here.”  Twenty minutes passed before I spotted Dean’s truck pulling in a young girl sitting in the passenger seat. Dean smiled at me as he got out and opened the girl’s door.  “Y/N this is Claire. She’s a good family friend” Dean introduced.  I extended my hand nervously. “It’s nice to meet you.”  Claire smiled back shaking my hand. “You too. So Dean brought me here to go shopping with you said people in this town were being assholes to you?”  I felt embarrassed glancing at Dean who looked apologetic for his improvised plan. “Uh yeah.”  “Well don’t worry. People dislike me more than they could dislike you and I also do enjoy shopping so let’s go” Claire said with a reassuring smile.  I laughed silently thanking Dean for sending her my way. After Dean left Claire hopped into my car her manner friendly.  “Dean is crazy about you it’s hilarious” Claire remarked.  “Really?” I asked surprised.  She chuckled. “I didn’t even have a chance to say yes. He was already at my door pulling me into the truck saying he needed a huge favor.”  “Oh…”  Claire frowned slightly. “Not that hanging out with you is a favour. He told me you didn’t have many friends here and people weren’t treating you right. He thought we might get along so here I am. I don’t have many friends here either so it works out.”  I nodded touched by Dean’s thoughtfulness but also feeling a pang of insecurity. It was sweet of him yet I couldn’t shake the feeling of being a charity case.  “Earth to Y/N?” Claire’s voice snapped me back to reality.  I managed a sad smile. “Sorry I just… I hope this doesn’t seem pathetic. Like Dean had to beg you to be friends with me.”  Claire shook her head laughing lightly. “Even if it does he had good intentions. Maybe we’ll become great friends because of this or maybe not. Either way let’s make the most of today.”  I nodded in agreement as we arrived at the store. Claire’s easy confidence helped ease my nerves and I found myself enjoying her company. She didn’t treat me like a charity case; instead she was sassy and genuine.  As we browsed through clothes Claire asked “So what are you planning on wearing tonight?”  I shrugged. “Dean said something comfortable and casual.”  “Are you planning on… you know tonight?” Claire asked bluntly with a smirk.  I blushed deeply surprised by her directness. “Claire!“  She chuckled and nodded &quot;Yeah I’m straightforward like that. But seriously are you making any plans or are you more of a wait-until-the-third-date kind of person?”  The idea of something potentially happening with Dean made butterflies flutter in my stomach. Did he expect us to be intimate tonight? Was that the norm for dating now?  “I honestly haven’t thought about it until this moment. Do you think he’s expecting it tonight?”  Claire laughed softly and shook her head. “Dean is a true gentleman. As much as he annoys me and gets on my nerves he’s kind protective and wouldn’t harm a fly. It all depends on what you’re comfortable with.”  She offered me a couple of shirts but they didn’t quite fit my style. Dean had said to be comfortable but I also wanted to impress him. The last times he saw me I wasn’t looking my best.  Claire returned with armfuls of clothes a wide grin on her face. “Changing rooms let’s do this!”  Following her to the back I stepped into a dressing room as she handed me various outfits. They weren’t my usual choices but surprisingly cute.  I tried on the burgundy leggings a white tank top and a jacket Claire gave me. When I looked in the mirror I was surprised—I felt beautiful for once. The leggings fit my curves nicely and the top showed off my shape. I knew Dean would be surprised; he’s only seen me in baggy clothes before.  Stepping out I found Claire waiting her jaw dropping in awe. I couldn’t help but laugh at her reaction. “Wowww. Girl Dean won’t know what hit him.”  After paying and grabbing a quick lunch I dropped Claire off at her house. Before she left she asked for my number which made me feel valued. It seemed like things were finally looking up.  Back at the motel I checked the time—it was already 5:30 just an hour before Dean would pick me up.  I was feeling even more nervous now. Dean was coming soon and I was wearing something a bit more revealing. It was scary but I had a feeling Dean would like it. I couldn’t wait.  I had just finished putting on makeup and getting dressed when a knock on the door grabbed my attention. Quickly adjusting my outfit I nervously made my way to the door.  When I opened it we both paused taking each other in. Dean looked incredibly handsome in a red button-up shirt layered over a black t-shirt paired with faded blue jeans. He looked even better than I remembered if that was possible.  His eyes scanned me from head to toe and he let out a low whistle before meeting my eyes with a smile. “Wow… Y/N you look stunning.”  Blushing wildly I fiddled with my hands trying to hide my flustered grin that probably made me look like a teenager—but he noticed and it only made him smile wider.  He then pulled out a bouquet of flowers from behind his back and held them out to me. “Dean! You really didn’t have to get me flowers.”  He shrugged his smile turning a bit shy. “I know but I thought they might brighten up the motel room a bit.”  I leaned in and kissed his cheek chuckling softly as his cheeks turned red and he looked bashful. He was adorable when he was shy.  After putting the flowers in water I grabbed my coat and followed him outside. I glanced around looking for his truck which caused him to laugh. “You didn’t think I’d show up for our date in my tow truck did you?”  “I wouldn’t judge if you did. Which car is yours?” I asked.  He pointed to the black car and my jaw dropped. It was the most amazing car I’d ever seen. I didn’t know much about cars but when I was a kid my dad had taught me a thing or two especially about this one.  “Oh my god. No way. A ‘67 Chevy Impala? Those are a rare breed.”  He froze staring back at me in awe clearly surprised that I recognized the car and its classic status.  “Whoa a girl after my heart. You know a lot about cars?” he asked.  I shook my head and chuckled. “No my dad was the car enthusiast. He collected them. We had a calendar of classic cars and this Chevy was featured in May. I always thought it was the most beautiful car.”  His smiled wider “Well thank you. I love her and I’m glad you do too.”  “Her? What’s her name?”  He blushed looking down. “Baby.”  I giggled and playfully nudged his arm. “Does that ever confuse the ladies?”  He chuckled along with me his blush spreading. “Nah I mix it up depending on the person.”  “Good to know.”  He opened the car door for me and then walked around to the driver’s side. As he got in I couldn’t help but be fascinated by the car. I barely noticed when we started driving; it was just such a perfect match for Dean.  He drove for a while asking about my life-where I came from how many siblings I had. It was clear he was avoiding talking about Andrew and I was grateful for that. I turned to face him better but then I froze. My eyes locked on the cut on his lip and the green bruise on his cheek.  “What?” He asked nervously offering a smile.  “What happened to your face?” I asked concern in my voice.  His hand went to his lip and he nodded in understanding seeming to have forgotten about his cuts and bruises.  “Oh uh nothing really. Family disagreement nothing major.”  I narrowed my eyes and sighed feeling a connection. “Look at both of us the weirdos with bruises.”  He chuckled softly and placed his hand on my leg squeezing gently. My heart skipped a beat and I felt a rush of emotions like a teenager again.  It took a while to reach the lake Dean wanted to bring me to and as soon as did nerves flooded back. This was real-the first date. The night that could shape our relationship. It was more nerve-wracking than I remembered.  He got out of the car and went to the back pulling out a blanket a bottle of wine and a cooler. I couldn’t help but smile as my heart warmed; he had put so much thought into our first date and it meant a lot.  Once the blanket was set up he sat down next to me and opened the cooler grabbing snacks for us both.  &quot;Wow Dean you went all out.”  His cheeks turned a shade of red as he chuckled nervously. “Sometimes I do.”  He reached for the wine but hesitated his eyes searching mine. “Um is the wine okay or?”  I furrowed my brows in confusion a nervous smile forming. “Why wouldn’t it be?”  He seemed lost in thought for a moment as if trying to figure out how to explain something. Then it hit me—he must have heard the rumors around town. He believed them.  I dropped my head feeling my heart sink. I had thought he of all people wouldn’t believe those things about me. But clearly he was uneasy about drinking afraid the rumours were true.  He sighed and placed his hand on my leg. “I didn’t mean anything by it… it’s just…”  “You heard the rumors about my drinking problem and now you’re worried about me” I finished for him.  His eyes widened and he put the bottle down leaning closer. “No! No not at all! I just…”  He sighed heavily brushing his hair back in frustration. “Sometimes rumours are spread and sometimes there’s truth to them even if it’s exaggerated. I just needed to check to make sure you weren’t at risk or uncomfortable with drinking.”  He frowned removing his hand from my leg clearly feeling guilty. I wasn’t angry at him—I was frustrated with Andrew and those stupid rumors. I just wanted to be myself without judgment.  Turning towards him I grabbed the wine and popped the cork taking a sip to ease the tension. He smirked and nodded taking the bottle from me and joining in.  I sighed and moved closer. “Okay before our date really gets going let’s clear the air. No more doubts about me. Tell me what you’ve heard and I’ll tell you if it’s true. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.”  He nodded turning to face me. After a moment of thought he spoke up. “One thing I heard was that you used him and then left but I already know that’s not true.”  “How do you know that’s not true?”  “Because I was at that motel that day. I saw what he was doing and the look on his face. Also if you had used him and taken his money you wouldn’t have come in without a tow truck that day.”  I smiled and nodded. “Good detective work. What else?”  He sighed and handed me the bottle. “That you have a drinking problem and get violent when you’re under the influence.”  “Okay. I don’t have a drinking problem. Andrew did. We went to parties had a few drinks and when I stood up to him because of the liquid courage he blamed it on that. Also I only hit him once—the day at the motel. That part was true.”  He nodded his hand returning to my leg in a comforting gesture.  “What else?” I asked handing him back the bottle. He took a swig and looked down.  “I heard that the bruises on your face were from a bar fight and you blamed him for it. But again I know that’s not true.” He laughed.  I sighed and nodded. “I was in a bar fight technically. I was drinking with my neighbor and this random girl thought she was hitting on her boyfriend—she actually was—so the girl got in her face. I stepped in and the girl swung at me. But after that I went home. My neighbor apparently told her husband I was the one hitting on the guy from the bar and he told Andrew. When I got home Andrew was furious and drunk. I tried to walk away but he…”  I froze tears welling up as I recalled the painful memory. “He grabbed me and threw me to the ground. That was the first time he hit me.”  Dean winced his jaw tightening. “Is that when you left?”  I shook my head tears streaming down my face. “No. I was stupid and stayed. About a week later I found out he was sleeping with the neighbor. I confronted him angry and hurt. He called me a liar said I was drunk and imagining things. So I got even angrier threatened to leave and told him I’d expose him for who he really was. That’s when he snapped… I don’t remember much after that—it happened so fast—but I remember the pain of his fists over and over again. I remember seeing the blood on his hands and the smile on his face. I thought ‘I’m going to die tonight. My fiancé is going to kill me.’ And honestly at that moment I was okay with it. The pain he caused me was unbearable.”  My head hung low as I sobbed quietly the weight of the memories crushing me. Dean pulled me onto his lap wrapping his arms around me protectively. “It’s okay. He’s not going to hurt you anymore. I won’t let him” he whispered soothingly.  I sighed and looked up Dean’s thumbs gently wiping away my tears.  “I’m sorry” I choked out.  His brow furrowed in confusion. “Sorry for what sweetheart?”  “For ruining our date. I shouldn’t have talked about that.”  He shook his head holding me tighter. “Don’t apologize. You didn’t ruin anything. In fact you’ve made me feel even closer to you. I appreciate you telling me. It couldn’t have been easy.”  I shook my head resting against his shoulder my arms holding him close. A weight lifted off my shoulders—I wasn’t alone in this anymore. Someone finally believed me.  He kissed my forehead and smiled softly. “Now let’s sit down and talk some more. We’ll still have a great night okay?”  I nodded leaning in slowly to press my lips against his. Each kiss felt like the first and with each one I felt myself falling even deeper in love.  It was only our first date but I knew—I was falling hard.  Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it! Chapter 4 coming soon stay tuned!  Like comment and reblog feedback is my fuel 💕,2024-07-11 19:54:04 GMT

22,Supernatural,['sleep thoughts'  'dean winchester'  'spn'],prishallucinate,There’s just something about the show supernatural that continues to draw me to it. Sure it doesn’t have the best plot most of the seasons. The episodes are kind of repetitive. There are several other tv shows that are so much more fast paced thrilling and fun when compared to supernatural.   But I find myself coming back to it every single time. Countless rewatches. Convention videos. It’s a loophole. I watch a show obsess over it a short while then kinda let it go. But with spn it’s become my comfort series. Helped me get over a situationship breakup. Never failed to make me laugh. Whenever I come back here I’m in it deep for a month at least as I rewatch scenes bloopers read fanfiction watch edits and con clips. A loophole I love.   I guess essentially it’s the characters I love so much. So unique so normal yet so attractive and warm it’s like I feel right watching the brothers hunt kill argue drive shoot hug and then and there I forget the world around me it doesn’t matter I’ll just watch another episode with a broment. It’s stupid but I don’t feel alone when I’m deep in the fandom. Maybe it’s the distraction it’s providing that helps me so much.   Or it could be the actors who played Sam and Dean who evidently very deeply care for their fans the show and the characters. Their friendship is something beautifully real so much that it restores hope in my heart. Their raw funny selves the endless cons they make sure not to miss even though the show ended long ago the way they portrayed the brothers to unreal perfection. Like no one could’ve been better.   I don’t know what is it about this stupid show that doesn’t let me go. No matter how great of an award winning show I watch I’ll always come back to supernatural.,2024-07-11 19:48:48 GMT
163,Supernatural,['sam winchester'  'sam girl'  'jared padalecki'  'jared girl'  'spn'],hexedwinchester,Sam Girls United i love how we as Sam Girls from different countries race background ethnicities watch Supernatural and invariably agree on these things…  His Carhartt jacket is just as iconic as Dean’s leather jacket and we miss it. Sam’s anger towards John is completely valid as someone who believed in questioning everything instead of blindly following orders. It wasn’t selfish of Sam to ask for the last of lucky charms. Plus he really didn’t eat it. He plucked out the toy from the packet and offered it to him. Sam was a lonely kid and this has nothing to do with Dean. He grew up believing he was a freak and unclean. He didn’t have closer bonds outside of Dean and it fucks us up. Sam didn’t start the apocalypse. It was a result of combined efforts of angels demons and unknowingly Dean but Sam ended up being the fall guy. Loss of bodily autonomy!!!! Soulless Sam was nobody’s fault but Castiel’s. Soulless Sam was hot and we stand by him. Just because Sam hit a dog and didn’t look for Dean doesn’t mean he does not care about his brother.  Dean tricking Sam into letting Gadreel possess him was a worse betrayal than Sam not looking for Dean when he was in purgatory. We are suckers for Sam Whump/hurt Sam because we love how pretty he looks when he is hurt! Majority of us don’t like sabriel or sastiel. Demon Dean not feeding Sam his blood was a missed opportunity!! Sam is BAMF and you can’t tell us otherwise! Bonus: Jared’s eyes are sunflowers and he is a freakin ray of sunshine,2024-07-11 19:39:46 GMT

Up today s5e7: The Curious Case of Dean Winchester.  Bobby makes a bid to join Sam and Dean’s League of Extraordinary Idjits by playing a supernatural card game with a devilishly handsome magic man in which the stakes are years of your life instead of money. He loses because of course he does. And then Dean rushes off to try to win back Bobby’s years. And loses. Because of course he does. So Dean walks out of the game an old man and the three of them start scrambling to figure out how to beat Hottie McCardshark. (Folks this dude is ATTRACTIVE.) And then Sammy who has been feeling that Dean is treating him like a little kid - you guessed it - plays to save Dean. No one seems to think he can do it but of course he pulls through with an impressive bluff. Amongst all the card playing there’s a sweet and sad little story about the cardshark’s wife being unhappy with their everlasting lot and a not-so-sweet side bit with Bobby being ableist and sexist.

Up today s5e6: “I Believe the Children Are Our Future.”  People are… dying weird in a… small town so the boys… go to investigate. (Have we been here before?) Turns out childhood myths and falsehoods (like you can electrocute someone with a joke hand buzzer and your face can freeze that way) are true in this small town—or in part of it anyway. And it’s all because of Jesse a sweet pre-teen kiddo who has the power to make such things come true—mostly unintentionally. Why? Well because he’s the antichrist of course. Sam Dean and Cas argue about what to do about him (side trip into Cas getting turned into a plastic action figure) and eventually Jesse decides to leave on his own to protect his (adoptive) parents. Aaaaand then we never hear about any of this again. It’s fine. It was all really about Sam afterall.  Below is a log of our real-time reactions as we watched. Remember that there may be spoilers for any part of SPN’s 15-season run here. Note also that the nature of our conversation is adult and thus it may contain adult language and themes.    and we begin:  Lor:  ew kid  Mace:  yep gross  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Lor:  okay when I babysat I turned on as many lights as I thought I would not get made fun of for when the parents got home  Mace:  HAHAHA  omg the dude’s scream  Lor:  LOL  Mace:  you need to see Amber’s body Bean?

Story - Did I ever tell you how I gripped you tight and raised you from perdition? Pairing - Castiel/Dean Winchester  Rating - Mature  Word Count - 1867  Summary - After they save Cas from the empty he and Dean start a relationship. On their wedding night Castiel decides to recount the story of how he pulled Dean from hell and how he fell in love with the righteous man he was destined to save.  “You remember my first words to you in the barn?” Castiel asked arms around Dean as he lay resting on him. They had just made love for the first time after their wedding an affair so small that they only had the priest for the service and Sam as a witness. He made scarce not long after knowing from their looks that Cas and Dean wanted to go to the nice hotel they booked and consummate their marriage.  Not that they hadn’t been consummating their relationship for a long time.  Fatigue was pulling at his mind as he rested his head on the warm man behind him. He wanted nothing more than to sleep but his curiosity was now piqued. Keen to see where Cas was going with this. He turned his neck cheek resting on his husbands pec so he could get a better look at him. Cas chuckled at the look of confusion clouding those gorgeous green eyes. He leant down tenderly taking his husbands lips in his own. Smiling when they broke apart moments later.  “The first time we met?” Dean replied unconsciously grabbing Castiel’s left hand pulling it in front of him and placing gentle kisses on his knuckles before pulling away and examining the ring finger. Where there now lay a simple but elegant white gold ring. He couldn’t believe after 12 long years and after almost losing one another forever when Cas was taken by the empty that they had made the commitment to love each other for the rest of their lives. Dean kissed his hand tenderly again before draping it around his chest until it rested on his shoulder. Sagging even further into the grip of his husband.  This was the happiest he had ever been in his life.  “Yes the first time we met. In the barn after I saved you from hell.” He was shifting from underneath him now manoeuvring them so they were laying side by side facing one another. Cas clasped Deans ring hand and pulled it to his heart enjoying the feeling of the slightly warm gold against his chest. A broad smile adorned his face recounting the memory in his mind as if it was a happy one.  When Dean looked back at that time all he could remember was the fear as he was faced with this unknown entity claiming to be an Angel of the Lord. An entity that could turn the eyes of a human into liquid with just one look; that could make somebodies ears bleed just by trying to talk to them. An entity that would bring his wings out as a show of intimidation behind him. Fear at being told his raising from the pit had been a command from God himself.   He had to admit though that little confused head tilt was the most adorable thing he’d ever seen.  “What about them my sweetheart?” With their new position he could now run his hands softly up his husbands sides enjoying the small whines he was eliciting from his loves lips. Before Cas answered he leant down and kissed Dean tenderly.  “Did I ever tell you how I gripped you tight and raised you from perdition?” Those words still had an effect on Dean that made him shiver. They rarely spoke about his time in hell or how Cas saved him. For years he was plagued by nightmares of his tenure there. How he went from tortured to torturer slicing pieces of souls for his tormentors for Alastair the demon that took him under his wing. As time passed the nightmares faded but he still didn’t want to discuss what he did how his actions were the start of the apocalypse. When he and Cas begun a relationship some of the nightmares returned. His brain associating his lover with that traumatic moment in his life. When he awoke from them screaming Cas held him close murmured words of love and comfort until he would fall back asleep. His patience and love got him through and that’s why he knew he would get through this conversation.  He shook his head bringing his hand up to his left shoulder lamenting the loss of the handprint a mark of claim from the man he loved. Castiel smiled softly bringing his arms around Deans waist running his hand up his lower back softly to indicate it would be okay.  “When I found you in hell I expected to find you on the torture racks. It shocked me to see you had submit to Alastair and had now become the torturer.” Dean hid his face in shame at the words only lifting his eyes when Cas pulled his chin up. They had never broached this subject before and Dean feared how his husband would see him. But those beautiful blue eyes showed nothing but understanding and love. He swallowed his shame down when Cas bought his hand up to cup his cheek. Smiling to show him that they could get through this. Everything would be okay.  He believed him.  “I remember approaching your soul. Angel blade in hand ready to fight any demon that stood in my way. But none did they submitted. A surprising turn of events considering how many of my brethren I lost on the way to finding you.” There was a small look of grief on his face. Wanting to comfort him Dean moved forward and pressed a soft kiss to those lips he loved so much. Reaching up and lacing his fingers around the hand still laying on his cheek. He nodded a silent indication Cas should continue. “When I got to you. I saw a haunted man who had been broken. One who had picked up the knife in a bid to stop their own pain. You claimed you enjoyed hurting other souls but nothing in your eyes suggested that to me at the time. Those green eyes still spoke of hope. They were a light in that terrible darkness.”   Unconsciously Dean had drifted closer to Cas now resting his head on his chest as he listened to his husbands words. He let out a shaky breath waiting for Cas to continue.  “Alastair was there by your side with that twisted smile on his face. As I stood pleading with you to come with me he laughed and goaded me. You told me you didn’t deserve to be saved you were at home in hell and these were your kind now. I was resolute though I was not leaving without you. Not when I had come so far and lost so much in my mission to save you.  “There was a shift when Alastair realised I wasn’t going to leave empty handed. The demons who had stood by and let me through now advanced on me. There were too many for me to take down at once. I managed to ‘gank’ a few as you would say.” Dean snorted with laughter imagining his husbands dorky little air quotes as he said the word gank causing Cas to grin a little before continuing his story.  “I knew if I didn’t take action I would be lost in the depths of hell an unsatisfactory place for an Angel. I grabbed your wrist but you wrenched away from my grasp hissing in pain and demanding I leave as you didn’t deserve to be saved.  “Lost and out of ideas I got close enough. Pulling your back to my chest running my arm over just below your neck and gripping your left shoulder in my hand.” As he recounted the way he held him in hell Cas started to mirror it in real life. Turning his husband so his back was nestled against his chest his arm across his body. When he placed his hand over the left shoulder Dean gasped. It was psychological he was sure but when Cas touched him there an incredible pleasure would shoot up his body. Like a spark of electricity. He felt feather light kisses against his neck and shoulder causing him to groan softly and move to give Cas more room.  “As I held you close your soul reached out to my grace. It was as if we were a perfect balance of one another yin and yang. It was that moment I wanted you all to myself Dean. I didn’t care if you had a higher purpose as Michaels vessel I just wanted to claim you as my own. I had never felt so complete with another being.” He growled biting down a little on Deans neck causing the ex-hunter to moan in delight. He loved when Cas became all possessive.  “I clutched you tight to my chest and flew you out of the pit. Leaving behind the screams of Alastair and his demon flock. During the ascent your head lulled back and you stared at me with those gorgeous green eyes with a look of awe and love.” Reflecting Cas’s words Deans head lulled back against his husbands shoulder who bought his free hand up to tenderly grab his chin. “This look this is the moment I knew our bond was profound and you could feel it to.” He caressed Deans lips with his own briefly before finishing his story.  “Once we got to Earth I repaired your damaged body and soul. But that hand print my one of claim I couldn’t bare to heal it at that moment. I needed those in heaven on earth and in hell to know that you Dean Winchester were mine and mine alone. And today I finally made good on that promise.” There was a snarl in his voice as he bent down and nipped at Deans neck again causing him to gasp eyes fluttering shut enjoying the sensation of his husband running his lips down his neck and shoulder. He felt a hand dance down his abs towards his interested member not caring they had finished making love less than an hour ago.  “I have loved you from that moment in hell when I wrapped you in my arms and I will love you for the rest of eternity. On Earth; and in heaven.” Emotions had gotten the better of Dean small tears started to fall down his cheeks. He laughed slightly before wiping them away turning his head again once he had.  “I am always thankful you’re the one who saved me. I will love you for eternity to my Angel.” He whispered before they kissed passionately knowing this kiss was only going one way. All thoughts of fatigue had been wiped from Deans mind wanting to feel connected to his Angel in every way possible.  After that confession they made love multiple times throughout the night. In between kissing and touching one another unable to be apart for too long.  It wasn’t until the next morning Dean thought through those words again and confessed the secret he had been holding for 12 years.  When he looked into Cas’s eyes for the first time whilst being raised in that moment he realised he had already fallen in love with him.  He had always loved his Angel and he would for all eternity.,2024-07-11 19:59:58 GMT

Mechanic Dean x Reader  Chapter Summary: Dean and Y/N have their first date and Dean shows who he really is.  Series Masterlist here!! &amp; Main masterlist here!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; I woke up and glanced at the clock a frown creasing my face when I saw it was almost noon.   There was a time when I’d rise early whip up breakfast for Andrew and I followed by a job and enjoying coffee at the diner. I used to think that our relationship was so normal. You know like those housewives on TV who seemed so content. But that was just among the surface.  I didn’t realize how unnatural our relationship was-the yelling the screaming the constant bullying. Now that I’m finally out of it I see those things for what they were: toxic.  It wasn’t normal for my fiance to explode if dinner wasn’t ready to check my texts and calls every night or to be upset and physically punish me when I had an idea of my own. It took me months to realize that these weren’t normal relationship dynamics; they were signs of something deeply unhealthy.   What scares me the most is that Andrew was my only experience with relationships and now with Dean showing interest I wasn’t sure how I should behave around him. Is it okay to feel this strongly about him so soon? Will he think less of me because I don’t know what a real healthy relationship is?  As if fate was responding my phone rang on the nightstand displaying an unknown number. I hesitated briefly before answering and holding it to my ear.  “Hello?”  “Hey sweetheart it’s Dean.”  Instantly my worries melted away. There was something about him something magical almost because just hearing his voice made me feel better.  “Hey Dean what’s up?”  “I was just wondering if we are still on for tonight? Instead of dinner I thought maybe I could take you somewhere.”  A rush of questions and insecurities flooded my mind. Maybe he didn’t want to be seen with me after yesterday or maybe he wanted to cancel but didn’t know how to tell me.“  &quot;Y/N? You there?”  “Oh sorry yeah if that’s what you want to do. I mean obviously its your decision.”  There was a pause and anxiety started to creep in. Had I said the wrong thing?   He chuckled into the phone “Uh I’m glad your thinking of me Y/N but this is our date. I just wanted to bring you somewhere special. You can have an opinion you know?” His laugh was reassuring and I giggled in return.   Of course he was a gentleman on top of everything else.  “I think that sounds amazing. What time should I be ready for?”  “How does 5:30 sound?”  I smiled to myself “Sounds good. See you later Dean.”  With that I hung up and placed my phone back on the nightstand. A sigh of contentment escaped me as I thought about tonight. Perhaps this would be the night things changed for me.   Dean seemed like a genuinely nice guy he hadn’t judged me during the incident with Andrew. Maybe he was different from other men.  But as I thought about tonight my nerves started getting the better of me. What would I wear? Dean hadn’t specified if it was a fancy or casual outing. Not getting a clear instruction always made me anxious-I’ve made that mistake before.  i grabbed my phone and started typing a message then hesitated deleted it and finally sent it. He responded almost immediately.  I smiled to myself as I read through the messages repeatedly. It was tempting to remain in bed reading them but I knew I had to get up and start my day before my date later tonight.  As I made my way to my suitcase I frowned realizing I had fewer clothes than expected; half of my stuff was still at Andrew’s place and I had no intention of going back there.  Unfortunately I had to go shopping. I threw on my coat grabbed my purse and headed out sitting in the car debating where to go. There was a nearby clothing store but what if Andrew had talked to the staff and made things awkward there? There was another option out of town but it was quite a distance.  My phone rang and I couldn’t help but laugh seeing Dean’s name. I answered quickly. “Can’t stay away huh?”  He chuckled deeply. “You caught me. Missed you already! But I might need to push our date back an hour. Got stuck at work until 5:30 now instead of 4. Is it okay if I pick you up at 6:30?“  “No worries that’s fine” I replied.  “What are you up to today?” He questioned with a smile I could hear.  I debated whether to be vague or share. Part of me wanted to tell him about my day; strangely he seemed genuinely interested. “Just going shopping. Turns out I need more clothes than I thought.”  “Well have fun! Where are you headed?”  “Probably the next town over. I know there are a few shops there.”  He paused for a moment and my heart skipped a beat. “Oh that’s quite a journey. You must really like those stores” he teased.  I nervously giggled playing with my coat zipper. “Not really. Andrew has stirred up a lot of drama around here and I prefer to avoid it.”  He sighed audibly his concern evident even through the phone. &quot;Sweetheart stay right there. I’ll bring something to help you out.”  I chuckled softly biting my lip. “Okay. I’ll wait here.”  Twenty minutes passed before I spotted Dean’s truck pulling in a young girl sitting in the passenger seat. Dean smiled at me as he got out and opened the girl’s door.  “Y/N this is Claire. She’s a good family friend” Dean introduced.  I extended my hand nervously. “It’s nice to meet you.”  Claire smiled back shaking my hand. “You too. So Dean brought me here to go shopping with you said people in this town were being assholes to you?”  I felt embarrassed glancing at Dean who looked apologetic for his improvised plan. “Uh yeah.”  “Well don’t worry. People dislike me more than they could dislike you and I also do enjoy shopping so let’s go” Claire said with a reassuring smile.  I laughed silently thanking Dean for sending her my way. After Dean left Claire hopped into my car her manner friendly.  “Dean is crazy about you it’s hilarious” Claire remarked.  “Really?” I asked surprised.  She chuckled. “I didn’t even have a chance to say yes. He was already at my door pulling me into the truck saying he needed a huge favor.”  “Oh…”  Claire frowned slightly. “Not that hanging out with you is a favour. He told me you didn’t have many friends here and people weren’t treating you right. He thought we might get along so here I am. I don’t have many friends here either so it works out.”  I nodded touched by Dean’s thoughtfulness but also feeling a pang of insecurity. It was sweet of him yet I couldn’t shake the feeling of being a charity case.  “Earth to Y/N?” Claire’s voice snapped me back to reality.  I managed a sad smile. “Sorry I just… I hope this doesn’t seem pathetic. Like Dean had to beg you to be friends with me.”  Claire shook her head laughing lightly. “Even if it does he had good intentions. Maybe we’ll become great friends because of this or maybe not. Either way let’s make the most of today.”  I nodded in agreement as we arrived at the store. Claire’s easy confidence helped ease my nerves and I found myself enjoying her company. She didn’t treat me like a charity case; instead she was sassy and genuine.  As we browsed through clothes Claire asked “So what are you planning on wearing tonight?”  I shrugged. “Dean said something comfortable and casual.”  “Are you planning on… you know tonight?” Claire asked bluntly with a smirk.  I blushed deeply surprised by her directness. “Claire!“  She chuckled and nodded &quot;Yeah I’m straightforward like that. But seriously are you making any plans or are you more of a wait-until-the-third-date kind of person?”  The idea of something potentially happening with Dean made butterflies flutter in my stomach. Did he expect us to be intimate tonight? Was that the norm for dating now?  “I honestly haven’t thought about it until this moment. Do you think he’s expecting it tonight?”  Claire laughed softly and shook her head. “Dean is a true gentleman. As much as he annoys me and gets on my nerves he’s kind protective and wouldn’t harm a fly. It all depends on what you’re comfortable with.”  She offered me a couple of shirts but they didn’t quite fit my style. Dean had said to be comfortable but I also wanted to impress him. The last times he saw me I wasn’t looking my best.  Claire returned with armfuls of clothes a wide grin on her face. “Changing rooms let’s do this!”  Following her to the back I stepped into a dressing room as she handed me various outfits. They weren’t my usual choices but surprisingly cute.  I tried on the burgundy leggings a white tank top and a jacket Claire gave me. When I looked in the mirror I was surprised—I felt beautiful for once. The leggings fit my curves nicely and the top showed off my shape. I knew Dean would be surprised; he’s only seen me in baggy clothes before.  Stepping out I found Claire waiting her jaw dropping in awe. I couldn’t help but laugh at her reaction. “Wowww. Girl Dean won’t know what hit him.”  After paying and grabbing a quick lunch I dropped Claire off at her house. Before she left she asked for my number which made me feel valued. It seemed like things were finally looking up.  Back at the motel I checked the time—it was already 5:30 just an hour before Dean would pick me up.  I was feeling even more nervous now. Dean was coming soon and I was wearing something a bit more revealing. It was scary but I had a feeling Dean would like it. I couldn’t wait.  I had just finished putting on makeup and getting dressed when a knock on the door grabbed my attention. Quickly adjusting my outfit I nervously made my way to the door.  When I opened it we both paused taking each other in. Dean looked incredibly handsome in a red button-up shirt layered over a black t-shirt paired with faded blue jeans. He looked even better than I remembered if that was possible.  His eyes scanned me from head to toe and he let out a low whistle before meeting my eyes with a smile. “Wow… Y/N you look stunning.”  Blushing wildly I fiddled with my hands trying to hide my flustered grin that probably made me look like a teenager—but he noticed and it only made him smile wider.  He then pulled out a bouquet of flowers from behind his back and held them out to me. “Dean! You really didn’t have to get me flowers.”  He shrugged his smile turning a bit shy. “I know but I thought they might brighten up the motel room a bit.”  I leaned in and kissed his cheek chuckling softly as his cheeks turned red and he looked bashful. He was adorable when he was shy.  After putting the flowers in water I grabbed my coat and followed him outside. I glanced around looking for his truck which caused him to laugh. “You didn’t think I’d show up for our date in my tow truck did you?”  “I wouldn’t judge if you did. Which car is yours?” I asked.  He pointed to the black car and my jaw dropped. It was the most amazing car I’d ever seen. I didn’t know much about cars but when I was a kid my dad had taught me a thing or two especially about this one.  “Oh my god. No way. A ‘67 Chevy Impala? Those are a rare breed.”  He froze staring back at me in awe clearly surprised that I recognized the car and its classic status.  “Whoa a girl after my heart. You know a lot about cars?” he asked.  I shook my head and chuckled. “No my dad was the car enthusiast. He collected them. We had a calendar of classic cars and this Chevy was featured in May. I always thought it was the most beautiful car.”  His smiled wider “Well thank you. I love her and I’m glad you do too.”  “Her? What’s her name?”  He blushed looking down. “Baby.”  I giggled and playfully nudged his arm. “Does that ever confuse the ladies?”  He chuckled along with me his blush spreading. “Nah I mix it up depending on the person.”  “Good to know.”  He opened the car door for me and then walked around to the driver’s side. As he got in I couldn’t help but be fascinated by the car. I barely noticed when we started driving; it was just such a perfect match for Dean.  He drove for a while asking about my life-where I came from how many siblings I had. It was clear he was avoiding talking about Andrew and I was grateful for that. I turned to face him better but then I froze. My eyes locked on the cut on his lip and the green bruise on his cheek.  “What?” He asked nervously offering a smile.  “What happened to your face?” I asked concern in my voice.  His hand went to his lip and he nodded in understanding seeming to have forgotten about his cuts and bruises.  “Oh uh nothing really. Family disagreement nothing major.”  I narrowed my eyes and sighed feeling a connection. “Look at both of us the weirdos with bruises.”  He chuckled softly and placed his hand on my leg squeezing gently. My heart skipped a beat and I felt a rush of emotions like a teenager again.  It took a while to reach the lake Dean wanted to bring me to and as soon as did nerves flooded back. This was real-the first date. The night that could shape our relationship. It was more nerve-wracking than I remembered.  He got out of the car and went to the back pulling out a blanket a bottle of wine and a cooler. I couldn’t help but smile as my heart warmed; he had put so much thought into our first date and it meant a lot.  Once the blanket was set up he sat down next to me and opened the cooler grabbing snacks for us both.  &quot;Wow Dean you went all out.”  His cheeks turned a shade of red as he chuckled nervously. “Sometimes I do.”  He reached for the wine but hesitated his eyes searching mine. “Um is the wine okay or?”  I furrowed my brows in confusion a nervous smile forming. “Why wouldn’t it be?”  He seemed lost in thought for a moment as if trying to figure out how to explain something. Then it hit me—he must have heard the rumors around town. He believed them.  I dropped my head feeling my heart sink. I had thought he of all people wouldn’t believe those things about me. But clearly he was uneasy about drinking afraid the rumours were true.  He sighed and placed his hand on my leg. “I didn’t mean anything by it… it’s just…”  “You heard the rumors about my drinking problem and now you’re worried about me” I finished for him.  His eyes widened and he put the bottle down leaning closer. “No! No not at all! I just…”  He sighed heavily brushing his hair back in frustration. “Sometimes rumours are spread and sometimes there’s truth to them even if it’s exaggerated. I just needed to check to make sure you weren’t at risk or uncomfortable with drinking.”  He frowned removing his hand from my leg clearly feeling guilty. I wasn’t angry at him—I was frustrated with Andrew and those stupid rumors. I just wanted to be myself without judgment.  Turning towards him I grabbed the wine and popped the cork taking a sip to ease the tension. He smirked and nodded taking the bottle from me and joining in.  I sighed and moved closer. “Okay before our date really gets going let’s clear the air. No more doubts about me. Tell me what you’ve heard and I’ll tell you if it’s true. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.”  He nodded turning to face me. After a moment of thought he spoke up. “One thing I heard was that you used him and then left but I already know that’s not true.”  “How do you know that’s not true?”  “Because I was at that motel that day. I saw what he was doing and the look on his face. Also if you had used him and taken his money you wouldn’t have come in without a tow truck that day.”  I smiled and nodded. “Good detective work. What else?”  He sighed and handed me the bottle. “That you have a drinking problem and get violent when you’re under the influence.”  “Okay. I don’t have a drinking problem. Andrew did. We went to parties had a few drinks and when I stood up to him because of the liquid courage he blamed it on that. Also I only hit him once—the day at the motel. That part was true.”  He nodded his hand returning to my leg in a comforting gesture.  “What else?” I asked handing him back the bottle. He took a swig and looked down.  “I heard that the bruises on your face were from a bar fight and you blamed him for it. But again I know that’s not true.” He laughed.  I sighed and nodded. “I was in a bar fight technically. I was drinking with my neighbor and this random girl thought she was hitting on her boyfriend—she actually was—so the girl got in her face. I stepped in and the girl swung at me. But after that I went home. My neighbor apparently told her husband I was the one hitting on the guy from the bar and he told Andrew. When I got home Andrew was furious and drunk. I tried to walk away but he…”  I froze tears welling up as I recalled the painful memory. “He grabbed me and threw me to the ground. That was the first time he hit me.”  Dean winced his jaw tightening. “Is that when you left?”  I shook my head tears streaming down my face. “No. I was stupid and stayed. About a week later I found out he was sleeping with the neighbor. I confronted him angry and hurt. He called me a liar said I was drunk and imagining things. So I got even angrier threatened to leave and told him I’d expose him for who he really was. That’s when he snapped… I don’t remember much after that—it happened so fast—but I remember the pain of his fists over and over again. I remember seeing the blood on his hands and the smile on his face. I thought ‘I’m going to die tonight. My fiancé is going to kill me.’ And honestly at that moment I was okay with it. The pain he caused me was unbearable.”  My head hung low as I sobbed quietly the weight of the memories crushing me. Dean pulled me onto his lap wrapping his arms around me protectively. “It’s okay. He’s not going to hurt you anymore. I won’t let him” he whispered soothingly.  I sighed and looked up Dean’s thumbs gently wiping away my tears.  “I’m sorry” I choked out.  His brow furrowed in confusion. “Sorry for what sweetheart?”  “For ruining our date. I shouldn’t have talked about that.”  He shook his head holding me tighter. “Don’t apologize. You didn’t ruin anything. In fact you’ve made me feel even closer to you. I appreciate you telling me. It couldn’t have been easy.”  I shook my head resting against his shoulder my arms holding him close. A weight lifted off my shoulders—I wasn’t alone in this anymore. Someone finally believed me.  He kissed my forehead and smiled softly. “Now let’s sit down and talk some more. We’ll still have a great night okay?”  I nodded leaning in slowly to press my lips against his. Each kiss felt like the first and with each one I felt myself falling even deeper in love.  It was only our first date but I knew—I was falling hard.  Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it!

She glanced at the sign of the motel. It glowed against the dark night sky. She walked towards the rows of rooms searching for the one Dean was staying in. After she walked by a few doors she finally found the one she was looking for.    Room 118.   She gently knocked on the door not wanting to disturb the rooms near Dean’s. Despite the late hour she knew he would still be up. Probably researching for the case he had called her in to help on. He hadn’t given her many details over the phone. He didn’t know much yet. Only that he was dealing with a witch and that he hadn’t been able to find a pattern between the victims yet.    Dean quickly answered the door. He gave her a tired smile as he opened the door for her. Y/n stepped inside the small motel room. She instantly spotted the books Dean had spread out on his bed. She tossed her duffel bag on the empty bed and turned to Dean.    “Thanks for coming” Dean said stuffing his hands on the pockets of his jeans. He had been desperate whenever he’d called her. He’d been working this case for days yet he hadn’t been able to find anything other than hex bags. No connection between the victims and no apparent motive. The whole thing was giving him a headache. Without Sam or John available he had turned to an old friend.    “It’s not like you’ve never helped me out with a tough case” Y/n replied crossing her arms over her chest.   The two talked of recent cases. After a while of catching up they finally began working on the case. Despite being a rather capable hunter Y/n kept missing the obvious. She had never noticed the way Dean looked at her whenever she wasn’t paying attention. She never thought twice about why Dean had chosen her to help him. He had plenty of other people to call. It would stay like this. Y/n oblivious to the crush Dean had on her all while she harboured her own.      ▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣▣  A/N: Thanks for reading! Don’t forget to reblog!

SERIES MASTERLIST  A WINDOW SLIDES open and breaks the silence of the apartment briefly followed by soft curses from a woman’s voice and a light sound that seemed like a hand connecting with someone’s head. The two figures slide into the apartment smoothly and gently close it behind them they make their way silently through the apartment and look around at the decorations that lightly lined the walls.   The feminine figure stops and gestures for the masculine figure to stop but then she gestures for him to continue another figure leaps out and grabs his shoulder which causes a small brawl to break out. Another figure leaps out and grabs the feminine intruder and causes their own fight. It’s Dakoda and Dean who are the intruders each one quickly manages to pin their attackers to the floor.   “Hey baby brother.” Dakoda greeted Damien with a grin on her lips her hands gripping his wrists “You didn’t really think you’d win that fight did ya?” she asked but had spoken too soon as Damien managed to grab her left wrist and wrap his leg around her calf before switching their positions with a grunt flying from her lips at the same time that Sam had done the same to Dean.   “Okay get the fuck off.” Dakoda grumbled and shoved her baby brother off and stood up herself she stood beside Dean as they faced Damien and Sam who also now stood side by side.   “What the hell are you guys doing here?” Sam asked his eyes switching between Dakoda and Dean “Well I was looking for a beer.” Dean replied sarcastically Dakoda swatted his arm lightly with an eye roll.  “What the hell are you doing here guys seriously?” Damien spoke up beside Sam his arms crossed over his chest as he stared at his big sister and Dean.   “Okay. All right. We gotta talk.” Dean told them holding his hands up slightly as he got a bit serious “Uh the phone?” Sam asked incredulity in his tone as he looked at his older brother.   “If I’d&#x27;a called would you have picked up?” Dean asked sending his younger brother a pointed look. Before Dakoda could open her mouth to speak the light flickered on and enveloped the room Dakoda blinked to accommodate the sudden brightness and she looked towards the source which was a blonde woman wearing short shorts and a cropped Smurfs shirt.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; “Sam? Damien?” the blonde woman questioned as she looked at the four people standing in the hallway “Jess. Hey. Dean Dakoda this is my girlfriend Jessica.” Sam introduces as he goes to stand beside Jessica his arm wrapping lightly around her waist. Dakoda and Dean both check her out appreciate Dakoda is more subtle than Dean is as her gaze goes up and down Jessica slightly.   “Your brother Dean? And your sister Dakoda?” Jessica asked Sam and Damien as she connected the dots she gave both Dean and Dakoda a smile.   “Oh I love the Smurfs. You know I gotta tell you. You are completely out of my brother’s league.” Dean comments as he moves closer to stand near them Dakoda rolls her eyes in mock exasperation grabs the back of his jacket collar and drags Dean back to stand beside her.   “Just let me put something on.” Jessica goes to turn and leave to get other clothes only to be stopped by Dean’s voice “No no no I wouldn’t dream of it. Seriously.” his comment earns him a smack to the back of his head which makes him let out a small yelp and turn a glare at Dakoda who smiles innocently. Dean looks back over at Sam as his hand drops from his head after rubbing at it his expression getting more serious “Anyway I gotta borrow your boyfriend and friend here talk about some private family business.” he tells Jessica as he looks at Sam and Damien “But uh it was nice meeting you.” he finished Dakoda giving a soft smile from beside him.  “No whatever you two want to say you can say it in front of her.” Sam tells both Dean and Dakoda his arm gently tugging Jessica closer to his side. Dakoda locks eyes with Dean and gives him a shrug he rolls his eyes slightly before looking at Sam Jessica and Damien head-on “Okay. Um Dad and Javier haven’t been home in a few days.” Dean tells them Dakoda gives Damien a pointed look before letting her gaze drift to Sam.   “So they’re working overtime on a Miller time shift. They’ll come stumbling in sooner or later.” Sam told them his gaze stoney as he looked at them. Dakoda sighed heavily and crossed her arms over her chest nudging Dean’s arm subtly.   “Dad and Javier are on a hunting trip and they haven’t been home in a few days.” Dean told Sam and Damien Dakoda eyed her little brother’s reaction and saw the way his face fell slightly and nodded.   “Jess excuse us. We have to go outside.” Sam told Jessica quickly he left the room with Jessica and Damien so the two could get dressed. Dakoda and Dean walked to the front door to wait for them they occupied themselves by playing rock paper scissors. Dakoda glared at Dean after they got scissors again at the same time this had happened five times now and neither one refused to relent on using scissors. As Dakoda opens her mouth to give a mouthy comment Damien and Sam emerge and lead Dakoda and Dean out of the apartment.         Dakoda and Damien walked ahead of Dean and Sam hushed whispers came from Dakoda towards Damien as she explained the last hunt their dad had been on with John since Damien was more willing to listen than Sam seemed to be.   “I mean come on. You can’t just break in middle of the night and expect me to hit the road with you.” Sam told Dean as they emerged from the stairwell a few feet behind Dakoda and Damien “You’re not hearing me Sammy. Dad and Javier are missing. I need you to help me find them.” Dean told Sam his tone exasperated as the four of them walked towards where Dean and Dakoda had parked their cars.   “You remember the poltergeist in Amherst? Or the devil’s gates in Clifton? They were missing then too. They’re always missing and they’re always fine.” Sam told them as they came to a stop Dakoda now stood beside Dean as she looked at Sam “Not this time Sammy it’s serious.” Dakoda spoke up pleading with him to listen to them “Not for this long. Now are you gonna come with us or not?” Dean continued from beside her his hand subconsciously grasping her’s between them which Dakoda held onto immediately.   “I’m not.” Sam told them seeming firm on his decision despite the importance in Dean and Dakoda’s expressions Damien appeared to agree with Sam as he stood beside the taller Winchester “Why not?” Dean and Dakoda asked at the same time seeming upset at their decision.   “I swore I was done hunting. For good.” Sam told them “I’m done too Koda hunting isn’t for me.” Damien said in agreement. Dakoda sighed heavily and ran a hand through her hair Dean continued speaking to Sam as the Hernandez woman continued walking towards the parking lot with Damien following behind. She could hear the Winchester brothers speaking to each other seemingly having a heated discussion.   Dakoda turned and looked at Damien as they walked he was listening intently to Dean and Sam argue lightly before he locked eyes with his big sister who gave him a pleading look that seemed to finally convince him just as Dean convinced Sam. Dakoda smiled and she went to Dean shoving her hand into his front left pocket to pull out the Impala’s keys and darting towards the Impala before Dean could stop her. Dean darted after her and hastily tugged the keys from her grasp as they reached the trunk he gave her a playful glare as he opened the trunk himself to show Sam and Damien what John and Javier had been hunting just before they disappeared.   “All right let’s see where the hell did I put that thing?” Dean muttered to himself after he opened the spare-tire compartment that was the arsenal his hands digging through the clutter before Dakoda slapped his hands away lightly and grabbed a voice recorder he had been looking for.   “So when Dad and Javier left why didn’t you two go with them?” Sam asked watching them curiously with Damien standing beside him with his own curious expression “We were working our own gig. This uh voodoo thing down in New Orleans.” Dean told them “They let you two go on a hunting trip by yourselves?” Damien asked after as he stared at Dean and Dakoda.   “Dude we’re twenty-six.” Dakoda scoffed she placed the voice recorder in Dean’s hand just as he lifted up a folder from the trunk.  “All right here we go-” Dean begins going over the case with Sam and Damien as Dakoda fiddles with the items within the trunk ignoring Dean when he smacks at her hands. Dakoda focuses back in as Dean presses play on the voice recorder she had handed to him which had John’s voice “Dean…something big is starting to happen…I need to try and figure out what’s going on. It may… Be very careful Dean. We’re all in danger.” John’s voice came through the recording being a tad scratchy with something just beneath his voice which Sam caught.   “You know there’s EVP on that?” Sam asked Dean and Dakoda causing the latter to smirk subtly “Not bad Sammy. Kinda like riding a bike isn’t it?” Dean asked Sam shook his head slightly and looks away briefly. Dakoda snatched the recorder from Dean’s hand and held it out of his reach when he went to take it back “All right. I slowed the message down I ran it through a gold wave took out the hiss and this is what I got.” Dakoda told Damien and Sam as she held the voice recorder out this time and hit the play button “I can never go home.” a feminine voice rang through before Dakoda ended the recording she placed it back in Dean’s hands before he tosses it back into the compartment. He puts the shotgun down and closes the compartment door before shutting the trunk leaning against it afterward.   “Never go home.” Damien and Sam mumbled at the same time thinking over the words heavily “You know in almost two years we’ve never bothered never asked you for a thing.” Dean tells them his arm automatically curling around his best friend’s shoulders as the two looked at Damien and Sam who turned to each other and started whispering amongst themselves.   “All right we’ll go. We’ll go with you to look for them.” Sam said as he turned back to the older two “But we have to get back first thing Monday. Just wait here.” Sam told them he went to turn but Dean’s voice cut in “What’s first thing Monday?” Dean asked staring at his brother. Dakoda gave her baby brother a smile and nod before she walked to her car she slid into the front seat to wait.         The four hunters had stopped at a gas station so Dean and Dakoda could fuel up Damien and Sam stayed in the vehicles and had their passenger doors open as they talked about their siblings. Dakoda and Dean walked out of the convenience store with bags of junk food in their hands they walked to their own cars to set their stuff down. Dakoda had already asked her baby brother if he wanted anything so she had a cheese Danish in hand for him she tossed it to him as she walked to the gas pump. She dumped the items in her arms into the small backseat shoving passed Damien to do so and to mess with him. Dakoda walks to the driver’s side of the Impala just as Dean gets in she crouches beside his door and looks as Sam digs through Dean’s cassette tape collection.   “I swear man you’ve gotta update your cassette tape collection.” Sam told Dean as he rifled through the box on his lap “Why?” Dean questioned he looked at Dakoda and flicked her forehead which she quickly slapped at his hand at in response.   “Well for one they’re cassette tapes. And two” Sam holds up a few cassette tapes “Black Sabbath? Motorhead? Metallica?” he questioned as he held up each tape with the band. Dakoda leaned into the car and gave Sam a flick on his hand “Watch your mouth Sammy.” she snarked with a slight grin on her lips. She leans back and out of the window crouching beside the car once more.   “It’s the greatest hits of mullet rock.” Sam told them giving Dakoda his signature bitch face for flicking him the tape labeled ‘Metallica’ is taken from his hand by Dean.   “Well house rules Sammy.” Dean starts sliding the tape into place “Driver picks the music shotgun shuts his cakehole.” he grins as the music fills the car he starts the engine a second after and gives Dakoda a nod. Dakoda leaves the side of the car and walks to her Mustang on the other side of the pumps.         THE PURR of the classic Mustang pulls closer as Dakoda parks beside the Impala just before the bridge where a section was blocked off by police tape. Dakoda reaches over and pops open her glove compartment pulling out a box with fake IDs inside that range from reporters to the FBI. She pulls out two US marshall ids and hands one to Damien who gives her a bitch face but takes it anyway they step out and walk to the front of the Mustang to wait for Dean and Sam. Dakoda and Dean take the lead as they walk over to the police officers who are standing beside the latest victims’ car.   “You fellas had another one like this just last month didn’t you?” Dean asked as he reached them Dakoda standing beside him as she pulled her badge from her pocket.   “And who are you?” The officer asked them slightly turning his body in their direction as he looked at them. Dakoda and Dean both flashed their badges at the same time quickly tucking them away after a moment.  “Federal Marshalls.” Dean introduced gesturing to him and Dakoda and then to Damien and Sam “You four are a little young to be federal marshalls aren’t you?” the officer asked them as he scrutinized them slightly.   “Thanks that’s awfully kind of you.” Dean laughed slightly as he walked over to the car gazing at it questioningly Dakoda followed closely behind as she knelt down slightly to look through the windows but didn’t see anything that quite stood out just yet.   “You did have another one just like this correct?” Dean asked looking over the roof of the car at the officer Dakoda lifted her head up to gaze at the office questioningly “Yeah that’s right about a mile up the road. There’ve been others before that.” the officer responded getting back on task and focusing on the topic at hand.   “So this victim you knew him?” Sam questioned as he stepped up on the other side of Dean Dakoda listened as the two Winchester boys questioned the officer as she inspected the car to see if she could find anything but nothing popped out or grabbed her attention so she wandered back over to Dean’s side to listen to the rest of what the officer had to say.   “So what’s the theory?” Sam asked shoving his hands into the pockets of his jacket “Honestly we don’t know. Serial murder? Kidnapping ring?” the officer responded genuine confusion on his face. Dakoda couldn’t hold back the slight scoff that fell from her lips but sucked in a sharp breath when Damien jabbed her in the ribs she glared at the little brother subtly.  “Well that is exactly the kind of crack police work I’d expect out of you guys.” Dean remarked seeming to agree with whatever Dakoda had been thinking he held back a slight grunt when Sam’s foot stomps on his “Thank you for your time.” Sam thanked the officer before the four began walking away. Dakoda and Dean lifted their hands and slapped the back of Sam and Damien’s heads at the same time quickly causing them to wince and cradle the backs of their heads.   “You dick what was that for?” Damien hissed out at his sister who only glared lightly “Why’d you jab me in the ribs?” she hissed back they walked a few paces behind Dean and Sam “You don’t have to act like that towards them Koda.” Damien tells her scolding his sister about her behavior.   “Oh please Damien they don’t know what’s going on. All we have are Dean and Sam in order to find Dad and hunt whatever did this down.” Dakoda told him giving him a pointed look. She feels someone smack her arm and looks to see the Sheriff and two FBI agents walking onto the bridge she swats Damien’s arm to get him to look before all four pass the three officials with Dean muttering “Agent Mulder Agent Scully.” as they passed them.         Dakoda walked alongside Dean while Damien and Sam walked behind them Dakoda spots a girl with flyers in her hands and she smacks Dean’s chest to grab his attention.  “Think that’s her?” Dakoda asked she pointed the young woman out to Sam and Damien as well while Dean nodded with a shrug. All four of them walked over and Dean took the lead in questioning the young woman.  “You must be Amy.” Dean started standing a few feet in front of the woman Dakoda watched as ‘Amy’ nodded.  “Yea.” Amy confirmed as she gripped onto the flyers in her hands as she looked at the group of four in front of her “Yeah Troy told us about you we’re his uncles. I’m Dean this is Sammy.” Dean introduced himself and Sam before gesturing to Dakoda and Damien “This is my girlfriend Dakoda and her little brother Damien.” Dean finished wrapping an arm around Dakoda for the cover.   “He never mentioned you.” Amy told them with a confused expression she started walking away from them to the entrance of the diner.  “Uh well that’s Troy I guess. We’re not around much we’re up in Modesto.” Dean told her following after Amy with the other three.   “So we’re looking for him too and we’re kinda asking around.” Sam spoke up from Dean’s other side they watched as another young woman walked up and placed a hand on Amy’s arm. Dakoda looks to Dean and leans in to whisper into his ear “Stay here Damien and I are going to the library.” she whispered she wanted to get a head start on the research and she thought it would be weird if four people were questioning one girl. Dean gave her a nod and squeezed her arm before she stepped away and grabbed Damien’s arm the siblings walked away from the Winchesters to make their way back to the Mustang.   Dakoda and Damien get to the library twenty minutes later Damien making his way inside first while Dakoda stands by her car to wait for Dean and Sam and smokes one of her cigarettes. As Dakoda is waiting her mind races with possibilities of what they were hunting and what her dad had been hunting.   Dakoda had gone through two cigarettes by the time Dean and Sam finally pulled up parking behind her Mustang. She watched as Dean and Sam walked up heading over to her and she explained that Damien had been inside. Dean proceeded to tease her for “being lazy” to which she smacked him across the back of the head as they walked into the library Sam rolling his eyes at the two best friends. Dakoda snagged a rolling chair for her and Dean and plopped down into the seat beside her brother at the computer he was sitting at.  “Find anything kid?” Dakoda asked Damien who shook his head with a ‘no’ falling from his lips as his brows furrowed in frustration “Nothing yet but it feels like we’re missing something. What did you and Dean find out Sam?” Damien asked the youngest Winchester who had taken a seat at a computer a few seats down.   “There’s apparently a local legend about a woman who was murdered on Cenntenial Amy told us about it.” Sam told Damien watching Dean who was sitting in front of the computer. Dean’s fingers flew across the keyboard as he typed ‘Female Murder Hitchhiking’ and clicked ‘GO’ but came up with zero results so he replaced the word ‘Hitchhiking’ with ‘Centennial Highway’ which had the same response.   “Let me try.” Sam told Dean as he reached out only to get his hands smacked by his brother Dakoda watched them in amusement before Sam shoved Dean’s chair away and took over at the computer. Dean’s chair smacks into Dakoda’s and she lets out a small huff and grabs the handles of his chair to keep him from rolling away “You’re such a control freak.” Dean complains as he smacks Sam’s shoulder but rolls back over. Dakoda rolls over and peers over Sam’s other shoulder and Damien stands up to take a look as well.  “So angry spirits are born out of violent deaths right?” Sam asked as he typed into the search bar “Yeah.” Dean and Dakoda spoke at the same time barely looking at each other when they did.  “Well maybe it’s not murder.” Sam murmured as he replaced the word ‘murder’ with the word ‘suicide’ he hit the GO button and the four of them watched as articles popped up but Sam only clicked the one that was the most relevant.   A local woman’s drowning death was ruled a suicide the county Sheriff’s Department said earlier today. Constance Welch 24 of 4636 Breckenridge Road leapt off Sylvania Bridge at mile 33 of Centennial Highway and subsequently drowned last night.  Deputy J. Pierce told reporters that hours before her death Ms. Welch logged a call with 911 emergency services. In a panicked tone Ms. Welch described how she found her two young children 5 and 6 in the bathtub after leaving them alone for several minutes. She reported that their complex-…  What happened to my children was a terrible accident. And it must have been too much for my wife. Our babies were gone and Constance just couldn’t bear it“ said husband Joseph Welch. &quot;Now I ask that you all please respect my privacy during this trying time.”  At the time of the children’s death and Ms. Welch’s subsequent suicide Mr. Welch was at the Frontier auto salvage yard where he works the graveyard shift as associate manager.  “Connie might have been quiet but she was the sweetest most caring girl I ever knew” said Deanna Kripke a neighbor. “She just doted on those children.”  “This was 1981. Constance Welch twenty-four years old jumps off Sylvania Bridge drowns in the river” Sam told them as he read through the article Dakoda’s brows furrowed slightly in thought “Does it say why she did it?” she asked leaning closer to gaze at the article and taking a look at the picture of Constance.   “Yeah.” Sam confirmed Dean’s head cocks to the side and he frowns “What?” he asked leaning back slightly.   “An hour before they found her she calls 911. Apparently her two little kids are in the bathtub. She leaves them alone for one minute and when she comes back they aren’t breathing. Both die.” Sam explains to the other three Damien hums in thought and leans back on his heels with his hands shoved into his pockets. Dean and Dakoda look at each other with raised eyebrows and shrug “Hm. Dean hummed once before he focused back when Sam began speaking.   “&quot;‘Our babies were gone and Constance just couldn’t bear it’ said husband Joseph Welch.“” Sam read from the article the mouse point landing on a picture that looked familiar to the four hunters.   “That bridge look familiar to you?” Dean asked as he pointed at the picture Dakoda leaned in and gave Dean a look which confirmed it did.         The four hunters found themselves back at the bridge long after the sun went down to ensure the police wouldn’t be there to catch them. Dakoda walked towards the middle part of the bridge with Damien beside her she’s absentmindedly listening to Dean and Sam talk as the inspect the bridge where they suspect Constance took her ‘swan dive’ over the side of it after the death of her children.   “So you think Dad and Javier would have been here?” Sam asked as he took beside the railing of the bridge glancing towards Dean. Dakoda and Damien tried not to eavesdrop on the Winchester conversation but they had nothing else to do.  “Well they’re chasing the same story and we’re chasing them.” Dean told his brother as he continued walking along the bridge he glanced over at Dakoda who was acting like she wasn’t listening. Sam followed after Dean and caught up with him “So now what?” the youngest Winchester asked as the two walked side by side. Dakoda and Damien kept their distance but followed after the other set of siblings.  “Now we keep digging until we find him might take a while.” Dean told Sam walking a few feet ahead of Sam who had stopped.   “Dean I told you. I gotta get back by Monday–” Sam started staring at his older brother as he reminded him he wasn’t staying. Dakoda looked at Damien and saw the same look on her brother’s face and felt her shoulders slump slightly as she realized she would have to say goodbye to her baby brother again.   “Damien-” Dakoda started but was cut off by her brother “Koda you know I’m not meant for hunting I gotta go back to college.” Damien told Dakoda looking at his sister who had a vaguely hurt look in her eyes that she quickly covered up.   “Yeah I forgot. You’re really serious about this aren’t you? You think you’re going to just become some lawyer? Marry your girl?” Dean questioned as he looked at Sam having turned around to look at his baby brother. Dakoda listened to the Winchesters and sighed ‘Here we go’ she thought as she realized it was just going to escalate and turn into an argument.   “Maybe. Why not?” Sam asked tilting his head slightly “Does Jessica know the truth about you? I mean does she know the things you’ve done?” Dean asked watching as his younger brother stepped closer. Dakoda rolled her eyes and went to step forward only for Damien to place a hand on her arm and shake his head “No and she’s never going to know. About either of us.” Sam told Dean referring to both him and Damien.   “Well that’s healthy. You can pretend all you want Sammy. But sooner or later you’re going to have to face up to who you really are.” Dean told Sam turning around and walking along the bridge some more “And who’s that?” Sam asked following after Dean. Dakoda and Damien follow after them and close in a little to step in in case it escalates further than necessary.  “You’re one of us.” Dean told Sam over his shoulder as he kept walking only for Sam to rush to stand in front of him making him stop in his tracks “No I’m not like you. This is not going to be my life.” Sam told Dean standing in front of his older brother and slightly towering over him. Dakoda made her way closer and stood slightly behind Dean staying close in case they went physical.   “You have a responsibility to–” Dean is cut off by Sam “To Dad and Javier? To their crusade? If it weren’t for pictures I wouldn’t even know what Mom looks like. And what difference would it make? Even if we do find the thing that killed her Mom’s gone. And she isn’t coming back.” Sam ranted Dakoda felt her blood boil slightly but understood she watched as Dean quickly snagged Sam’s collar and pushed him up against the side of the bridge. Dakoda shot into action wrapping an arm around Dean’s waist and digging her heels into the concrete as she pushed Dean off of his brother while Damien went to Sam’s side “That’s enough Dean. That’s enough!” Dakoda murmured to Dean as she held onto him he struggled slightly but calmed down. Dakoda had her body positioned in front of Dean and she glanced to the side only to freeze at the sight of a woman standing on top of the railing.   “Dean..” Dakoda patted Dean’s chest but he doesn’t look at her she reached up without taking her gaze off the woman gripping his chin slightly and turned his head for him so he would look where she was. Dakoda feels Damien and Sam come up behind her to stand as they all looked at Constance who looked back at them before she placed one foot in front of her and leapt from the railing.   “Shit!” Dakoda shouts as all four hunters run over to the railing quickly looking over the edge but not seeing anything “Where’d she go?” Dean questioned as he looked into the river below but not seeing anything.   “I don’t know.” Damien murmured before Sam could open his mouth and before the youngest Winchester could speak at all the sound of the impala’s engine started and the headlights flicked on. The four of them looked over and stared at the Impala as it revs its engine “What the fuck?” Dean asked shock filling his gaze.  “Who’s driving your car?” Sam asked his brother Dean simply pulled his keys out from his front pocket and jingled them. Dakoda gapes at the keys before staring at the car she shares a glance with Damien before the Impala abruptly lurches forward which sends the four of them spinning around and sprinting away. They aren’t fast enough to outrun the speed of the car Damien thinks quickly and dives to the left of the Impala while it continues forward and Dakoda dives off the bridge with Dean and Sam. Dakoda gripped Dean’s jacket as they headed down into the river shouts coming from their mouths as they went.     Sam had managed to catch himself on a part of the railing and hang from it he looked below him at the river as he tried to pinpoint where Dean and Dakoda might have landed. He heard movement and looked up to see Damien standing on the bridge still “You okay Sam?” Damien asked reaching down to where Sam was to help him up.   “Dean? Dakoda?” Sam and Damien called out for their siblings once their feet were planted back on the bridge’s concrete. There was some splashing below and they looked to see Dakoda and Dean crawling from the river covered in mud.   “What?” Dakoda and Dean asked in sync clearly annoyed by the mud that covered their bodies “Hey! You guys alright?” Sam called down to them worried for them while always trying not to laugh.   “Super.” “Awesome.” Dakoda and Dean individually told Sam Dean lifted his hand and gave an A-okay symbol with his index finger and thumb while Dakoda gave a thumbs-up. Dakoda put her head down and groaned she slowly crawled away from the river and flicked mud off her arms and legs with a disgusted grimace. It took the two of them five minutes to trudge their way back up to the bridge grumbling under their breaths about the mud and the upholstery of their cars. Dakoda splits from Dean when they finally make it onto the concrete and asphalt of the bridge Dakoda going to her Mustang while Dean meets up with Sam at the Impala.   “Shut up Damien.” Dakoda grumbled as she walked to the driver’s side Damien only laughed louder at her words “Dude you smell like shit.” he told his sister with a grin.  “Dick.” Dakoda grumbled as she opened the driver’s door “Slut.” Damien grinned back as he opened the passenger side door Dakoda rolled her eyes fondly as she slid into the seat and grimaced as mud got on the seat and steering wheel.         Dakoda and Damien stood with Dean and Sam as they stood in front of the motel clerk’s desk so they could get two rooms Dakoda desperately needed a shower.   “Two rooms please.” Dean requested as he tossed a credit card down the name ‘Hector Aframian’ written on it. Dakoda rolled her eyes slightly as she realized Dean was using a fraudulent credit card to pay for her room as well but appreciated it and couldn’t judge him because she was no better.  “You guys having a reunion or something?” the motel clerk asked as he lifted the card and read the name “What do you mean?” Sam asked the clerk and slightly leaned forward with his head tilted.   “I had another guy Burt Aframian. He came and bought out a room for the whole month.” “the clerk told them handing the card back. Dakoda eyed the man slightly before Dean took the card back as Sam asked what room number. A few minutes later they found themselves outside the right room with Dakoda and Dean playing lookout and Sam and Damien working on picking the lock Damien was mostly observing Sam as he picked the lock.   The door swings open and Sam stands up walking in with Damien beside him as they look around the cluster-filled room. Two beds sat to their left with a group of newspaper clippings on the wall opposite the window and door the youngest Winchester and Hernandez reach out and snag Dean by the shoulder and Dakoda by the back collar of her mud-covered jacket yanking them both inside the motel room quickly.   “Tell me again why I couldn’t grab another room?” Dakoda questioned Dean as the group of four searched around the motel room “Because it’s safer this way and it’s not the first time we’ve all shared a motel room.” Dean told her with a shrug he reached over and turned a lamp on with a half-eaten rotting hamburger beside it. Dean lifted the hamburger up and sniffed it recoiling instantly at the smell and receiving a light smack on the shoulder from Dakoda “Put it down.” she scolded like he was a child he rolled his eyes “I wasn’t going to eat it.” he told her with a scoff.   “I don’t think they’ve been here for a couple of days at least.” Dean told Sam and Damien as he pointed at the half-eaten burger he had just sniffed Dakoda nodded in agreement as she stood beside Dean and looked around the room. There were some tell-tale marks of her and Damien’s father having been with John so it was still obvious that Javier was still hunting with John.   “Salt cats-eye shells…they were worried. Trying to keep something from coming in.” Sam told the other three hunters as he picked up a pinch of the salt and crushed cats-eye shells he looked to Dean who was now looking at the wall of papers and newspaper clippings.   “What have you got there?” Sam asked as he stepped up beside Dean and Dakoda Damien was standing by the window and peeking out through the curtains for a second before stepping away to look around.   “Centennial Highway Victims.” Dean responded Sam leaned over and inspected the clippings that date back to 1987 “I don’t get it. I mean different men different jobs–” Sam stared at the clippings before he crossed the room “–ages ethnicities. There’s always a connection right? What do these guys have in common?” Dean continues looking over the wall of papers. Dakoda walked around the room a bit and gazed at another wall with more paper clippings her hand reaching out to turn a lamp on so she could see better. She felt Sam come up beside her and take a look at the clippings.   “Dad and Javier figured it out.” Sam spoke up grazing one of the clippings with his fingertips “What do you mean?’ Dean asked turning to look at where Sam and Dakoda were standing.   “He found the same article we did. Constance Welch. She’s a woman in white.” Sam explained looking over the clippings and glancing at Dean.   “Son of a bitch.”” You sly dogs.” Dakoda and Dean murmured at the same time as the case started to make sense and piece itself together.   “All right so if we’re dealing with a woman in white Dad and Javier would have found the corpse and destroyed it.” Dean turns to Sam as he speaks his gaze flickering to Damien briefly. Dakoda tunes out of the conversation and wanders back to the other wall her mind going over the details of the case and what they could do next potentially especially if John and Javier hadn’t destroyed the corpse or what could be keeping the spirit here if they had.   Dakoda tunes back in when she sees Dean heading to the bathroom and she darts over smacking the back of his head as she passes with a laugh falling from her lips.  “Too slow pretty boy.” Dakoda calls through the bathroom door once she’s closed it behind her “Come on pretty girl.” Dean complains on the other side of the wood. Dakoda heard a distinct thump and knew Dean had thunked his head on the door “Don’t pout Dean I won’t be long.” she told him. It took Dakoda twenty minutes to get all the mud off her clothes and skin she had to persuade Dean to grab her duffle from her car since he had to get his own anyway. She emerged from the bathroom with fresh clothes and her skin rubbed raw where the mud had stuck to the hardest. She gave a teasing grin to Dean who flipped her off as he walked past her into the bathroom to get cleaned off himself.      “Well don’t you look pretty?” Dakoda teasingly asked Dean when he reemerged from the bathroom half an hour later she received a mocking glare from him which only made her laugh.   “Hey man I’m starving. We’re gonna grab a little something to eat in that diner down the street.” Dean told Sam referring to himself and Dakoda since Damine was just gonna stay with Sam in the motel room. “You want anything?” he asked his little brother. Dakoda had already stepped outside and had pulled her cigarette pack and lighter out glancing at the Marlboro packaging before she slid one out. She tucked the small box back into her jacket pocket and cupped one hand around the front of the cigarette as she lit the end taking a long drag as she tucked her lighter back into her pocket with the pack. Dakoda looked back to the door and saw Dean come out sliding his jacket onto his other shoulder as he walked down the steps. They begin to walk to the cars but they glance to their right their gaze landing on the police car and the police officers standing with the motel clerk. Dakoda cursed under her breath and looked at Dean “Call Sam and Damien.” she muttered Dean turned away and called Sam’s phone.   “Dude five-oh. Take off.” Dean spoke into the phone once Sam picked up “Uh they kinda spotted me. Go find Dad and Javier.” Dean responded to what Sam had said while Dakoda kept her eyes off the cops to not add suspicion she acted casual as she smoked her cigarette but she wasn’t happy about it being interrupted. Dakoda hears Dean hang up as the deputies approach she plastered on a fake smile alongside Dean as they look at the cops.   “Problem. Officers?” Dean asked switching his gaze between the two briefly before landing on the one on the right his badge read ‘Jaffe’.  “Where’re your partners?” Deputy Jaffe questioned keeping his gaze fixed on Dean but glancing at Dakoda.  “Partners? What partners?” Dean asked plastering feigned confusion on his face. Dakoda internally rolled her eyes and groaned she knew they were going to be arrested. Jaffe looks over his shoulders and jams his thumb in the direction of the motel room dragging his gaze back to Dean and Dakoda. Dakoda felt Dean fidget slightly and she grasped his hand in her free one slightly keeping her gaze on the officer.   “So fake US Marshals. Fake credit cards. You got anything that’s real?” Jaffe asked his hands grasping his belt as he stared the two down.   “My boobs.” “My ass.” Dean and Dakoda spoke a grin appearing on Dean’s face. Dakoda quickly flicked her cigarette bud to the ground and stomped on it before she was manhandled against the hood of the car closest to her and Dean. Dean’s face appears beside her as his shoulder touches hers she gives him a slight glare as they’re held against the hood and cuffs are slapped on their wrists by Jaffe who had an extra pair.         Several hours passed and night had fallen Dakoda hadn’t been told much and was being held on the same charges as Dean from the little she had been told by the arresting officer. She had refused to speak not knowing exactly what Dean had said and wanting to keep whatever cover story he had going.   Dakoda looked up from the metal table when she heard a commotion outside the room she was being kept in seeing officers sprint passed in a rush. Her brows furrowed in confusion before she heard scraping at the window behind her she looked over her shoulder to see a grinning Dean forcing the window open and climbing in. She stifled a laugh when he fell onto the ground below the window.  “Did it hurt?” Dakoda cooed teasingly she watched as Dean stood up and shot her a glare but there was a teasing glint in his eyes “I can leave you here ya know?” Dean feigned backing up back towards the window. Dakoda narrowed her eyes and jerked her hands against the cuffs “Don’t you dare pretty boy.” she grumbled. Dean laughed softly and moved back to her he glanced at the door as he began picking the lock on the cuffs.   “I would never pretty girl.” Dean told her with a teasing grin on his lips finally popping the lock on the cuffs. He tossed the cuffs onto the table before making his way back to the window he bends his knees slightly to give Dakoda a boost up despite not really needing it due to being five foot nine but appreciating it nonetheless. The two slip out of the police station and hurry away on foot finding a phone booth once they deem it safe since their cell phones got confiscated by the cops. Dakoda stands on the outside of the phone booth keeping her eyes out in case they get spotted. She couldn’t hear much of what was said on the phone only hearing Dean’s side. Her attention was snagged when Dean frantically called Sam’s name slamming the phone back in place in the phone booth.   “Dean what happened? Where’s Sam and Damien?” Dakoda asked as she watched him leave the phone booth “That Constance bitch showed up the phone cut out. Both of them are in my car.” Dean told her the two leaving the booth quickly.   “Okay let’s get back to the motel and get my car and we can go to Constance’s house. That has to be where they would take her.” Dakoda told Dean she grasped his hand tightly before releasing it. The two quickly ran to the motel and got into Dakoda’s mustang speeding out of the parking lot immediately Dakoda breaking several speed laws to get to the house.      Dakoda and Dean pulled up and leaped from the vehicle as soon as the engine was cut running over to where they saw the Impala sitting in front of the seemingly abandoned house. The two pull their guns from the back of the waistbands and take aim at the front driver-side window where they can see Constance sitting in Sam’s lap with her hand digging into Sam’s chest Damien is slumped in the passenger seat. Dakoda and Dean begin firing purposely aiming so none of the bullets hit Damien Constance flickers and glares at Dean and Dakoda before vanishing from sight.   “I’m taking you home.” Sam muttered before putting the car in drive and lurching forward as he crashed into the front of the house Dakoda and Dean immediately running inside after the Impala. Dakoda racing to the passenger side and ripping the door open “Damien!” she called out and gently cupped his head in her hands he groaned softly as he woke up and she breathed out with a relieved grin.   “Hey kiddo you okay?” Dakoda asked checking him over briefly before focusing on the small gash on his forehead “Jesus she really did a number on you.” she muttered under her breath. Dakoda helps Damien from the car and keeps a steadying hand on his shoulder but he gives her a look so she backs off but can’t help but linger closely to make sure nothing else was wrong. Dean and Sam come to their side and all four of them look behind them to see Constance with a large picture frame in her hands.   Constance glares at them and tosses the frame down before a bureau slides towards them Dakoda tackling Damien out of the way so they didn’t get hit but Dean and Sam got pinned against the side of the Impala by the bureau. Dakoda keeps her eyes on Constance as she stands back up the lights begin to flicker overhead and they all glance around. Constance looks terrified as she looks around water begins to pour from the top of the stairs and Constance looks up to the top of the staircase. A boy and girl stand at the top of the stairs their hands linked as they stare down at their mother.   “You’ve come home to us mommy.” the kids speak in perfect unison Constance stared at them with a distraught expression but doesn’t speak. The two kids vanish before they reappear behind her hugging her as she screamed in anguish and flickered slightly before the three of them melt into the floor.   Dakoda walks over to Dean and Sam helping them shove the bureau away from the legs before she walks back to Damien and grasps his arm at the bicep.   “So this is where she drowned her kids.” Dean said with a ‘huh’ expression looking around slightly. Sam nods at Dean’s words and absently rubs at his chest where Constance had dug her nails into.   “That’s why she could never go home. She was too scared to face them.” Sam told the three of them “You found her weak spot. Nice work Sammy.” Dean complimented smacking Sam on the chest where the injury sat causing Sam to laugh through the pain. Dakoda smacked Dean’s arm slightly as she walked back over Damien had told her he was fine.   “Yea I wish I could say the same to you. What were you two thinking shooting Casper in the face you freaks?” Sam asked looking between Dakoda and Dean.   “Saved your ass didn’t we?” Dakoda asked a hand propped on her hip as she looked at Sam with a ‘duh’ expression. She looks to her right and sees Dean lean down to inspect his car biting back a grin.   “I’ll tell you one thing. If you screwed up my car?” Dean twisted to look at Sam while still bent down “I’ll kill you.” Dean threatened his little brother who only laughed. Dakoda placed a hand over her mouth and laughed behind her palm she yelped when she felt Dean’s hand smack against her calf.         THE SOFT RUMBLING PURR of Dakoda’s Mustang approached the apartment building she had picked Damien up from a few days prior having to say goodbye to her baby brother already. She pulled behind Dean’s car and stepped out after cutting the engine hearing Damien grab his bag from the small backseat due to the rustling she heard. She walked to the front of the Mustang and looked at Damien with a disappointed expression but had a twinkle of pride glinting in her eyes.   “Call me if you find them Kody. Promise me.” Damien told Dakoda as he stepped over to stand in front of her “I promise kid.” Dakoda told him causing him to roll his eyes at the nickname.   “I’m not a kid anymore.” Damien complained with no real bite in his tone she smiled sadly before the two siblings hugged.   “I’m proud of you kiddo. Now go before I drag your ass back inot the car.” Dakoda playfully smack Damien’s shoulder before the younger of the two walked away with a mock salute. She watched him go before she looked at Dean who had just finished his own goodbyes with Sam she gave the green-eyed man a forlorn look before she went back to the driver’s seat of the Mustang.      Dakoda followed the Impala keeping an eye on the brake lights before she happened to glance at the watch on her wrist and felt her heart drop as she realized it had stopped working and was frozen. She stomped on her brakes and flipped her car around hearing Dean do the same thing as they both raced back to the apartment complex quickly.  Dakoda and Dean leapt from their respective vehicles as soon as they parked both making a mad dash towards the front of the apartment complex. They scaled the stairs quickly up to the right floor and sprint to Sam and Damien’s apartment door Dakoda lifts her leg and kicks the door in due to having gotten there first racing in due to the smoke they could both smell. Dakoda breaks for Damien’s room but doesn’t see him and knows he must’ve gone to Sam’s. She sprinted back through the apartment and barreled into Sam’s room where Dean was dragging Sam away from the bed that had a burning body on the ceiling above it. Dakoda looked on in shock as flashbacks flooded her mind but she heard Damien yelp and snapped back into the moment racing forward and dragging her own brother from the apartment like Dean had done to Sam.   It took five minutes for emergency services to flood the area and begin tackling the fire Dakoda stayed by Damien’s side as he was checked out by the paramedics due to the minor burn he received on his forearm. She knew she was acting like a ‘mother-hen’ but she couldn’t help it she felt like she almost lost him and couldn’t think about anything else on top of the flashbacks that kept plaguing her mind form having to watch her own mother burst into flames on the ceiling. Dakoda placed a hand on Damien’s shoulder and the two walked over to where Dean and Sam were standing at the Impala’s trunk she watched as Sam inspected a shotgun before tossing it inot the open trunk with a resounding thud.   “We got work to do.”           a/n - AHHHH ITS CHAPTER ONE AND FINALLY FINISHED!!!

Mechanic Dean x Reader  Chapter Summary: Life keeps beating Y/N down But Dean is there to pick her up.  Series Masterlist here!! &amp; Main masterlist here!  A/N: So some people might not like that it’s moving a little fast but when you know you know.. Plus who doesn’t believe in fate?  &lt;!-- more --&gt; It’s been a few days since our first date and each day I found myself falling deeper in love. The entire night replayed in my mind like a movie.   I remembered Dean’s gentle touch as he fed me strawberries our laughter filling the air when one fell. He spoke about his family and his love for working on cars. He shared stories of his little brother Sam and his late mother. There were tears shed and comfort exchanged and of course-the lingering kisses.  Nothing intimate happened on our first date it wasn’t that I didn’t want to-believe me I did-but I wanted to make sure everything between us was right genuine not just a spur of the moment thing.   Plus Andrew was the only one I’ve been with and I wasn’t ready for that big of a step. I wasn’t even sure if I was staying yet…  But when Dean touched me it was unlike anything I’d experienced before. It was tender fulfilling and it felt like he truly cared.  The next morning he called me for coffee setting a routine that helped me ease back into going out again. Despite the town’s gossip and judgmental glances Dean remained unfazed and eventually I stopped caring too.  Claire and I hung out shortly after our date bonding over lunch and swapping stories. She was a refreshing friend in this town one who didn’t judge or buy into rumors.  I knew I had to make a decision soon-whether to stay in this town or leave. I didn’t want to leave him but finding a job here was difficult and my money was running out.  I hadn’t told Dean about my thoughts of leaving. I didn’t want to burden him and honestly I hadn’t expected to develop such strong feelings for him so quickly. But I knew I needed to have a serious conversation with him about my future despite how much I dreaded the idea of losing something like this.  I pulled out my laptop scanning through job listings again. Most seemed tied to Andrew or businesses featured on his news channel-places unlikely to hire me.  With a sigh I closed the laptop and dialed Dean’s number. It had only been a few hours since we last spoke But I already missed him and his voice had a way of comforting me.  Dean picked up after the first ring. “Hey sweetheart.”  “Hey Dean. How’s work going?” I asked trying to sound cheerful.  “Busy. There was an accident so i’m working on two very expensive cars. It’s a bit intimidating.” he replied with a chuckle.  “You’re the best mechanic they could have” I reassured him laying my phone on my chest closing my eyes to savor his voice a moment longer.  “Thanks. How’s your day?”  I hesitated. Dean could always tell when something was bothering me. “It’s… okay.”  “What’s going on sweetheart?” he asked gently.  I sighed rubbing my forehead. “It’s… nothing. Just trying to figure out my next steps.”  Dean knew I was hiding something. “Next steps towards what? Is there anything I can do to help?”  I let out a nervous giggle. “Not unless you can offer me a job and a place to stay.”  There was a pause on the other end of the line that made my heart skip a beat. “I was actually thinking… maybe I can help with that.”  “What do you mean?” I asked my curiosity piqued.  “Well we’re looking for a secretary at the office and I could talk to my dad about it. And… I have a downstairs unit in my place that you could rent if you’d like” Dean offered sincerely.  I was taken aback by his generosity. “Dean as much as I appreciate that—”  “You’re not asking. I’m offering” he interrupted firmly.  I thought about the rumors swirling around town about me especially those involving Andrew. It felt wrong to accept Dean’s help like I was being tested or setting myself up for future criticism.  “Um… Maybe we could start with the job first and then we’ll see” I replied cautiously. “I don’t want to ask too much of you.”  Dean chuckled softly. “If that’s what you’re comfortable with sweetheart. How about you come by the site in about an hour and I’ll talk to John?”  “Okay that works for me. Thanks Dean” I said gratefully.  After saying our goodbyes I felt a rush of nerves. Not only was Dean trying to get me a job at his workplace but I would also be meeting his father John Winchester.  From what I’d heard John was an intimidating figure—intimidating yet fair. I hoped I made a good impression especially since I knew Dean’s job and possibly our future together were at stake.  I pulled into the parking lot and spotted Dean working underneath a car. I couldn’t resist sneaking up and playfully tickling his leg causing him to startle and bump his head on the car.  I covered my mouth trying to suppress a laugh but it was too late. Dean rolled out from under the car a wide grin spreading across his face. “Oh I’m so going to get you back for that sweetheart.”  I giggled helping him up. “I’m so sorry.”  He laughed deep and hugged me “It’s alright. Let’s go inside. I’ll introduce you to my dad” Dean said the nerves evident in his voice.  Little did I know Dean was as nervous as I was if not more. He knew his father had reservations about me especially after losing the interview because of our initial encounter.  Dean knocked on the office door and John Winchester’s sharp eyes instantly fixated on me. His expression tightened his gaze scrutinizing Dean. I sensed there was something Dean hadn’t told me but I wasn’t sure what.  “Dad I wanted you to meet Y/N L/N. Y/N this is my dad and the owner of Winchester Mechanics John Winchester.”  I offered a polite smile stepping forward to shake John’s hand. He chuckled under his breath his handshake gruff. He leaned back against his desk arms crossed his eyes returning to Dean. “Was there something you needed to talk about Dean?” John asked his tone cool.  Dean swallowed nervously his gaze dropping slightly. “Uh yeah. Y/N is looking for a job and I was wondering if you still had that opening for a secretary.”  John smiled faintly shaking his head. I knew at that moment I wanted to earth to open up and swallow me whole anything to get out of this situation.  “Dean could you give Y/n and me a moment alone?” Dean’s eyes widened as he turned towards me. I nodded quickly and he exited the room leaving me alone with his father whose stare could have cut through steel.  “You’ll have to excuse my son. Sometimes he acts without thinking” John said circling his desk and gesturing for me to sit. He sighed the tension in the room thickening around me.  “Listen Y/N. You seem nice and I’m sure you mean well. But I don’t think you’re the right fit for this place.”  “May I ask why?” I whispered.  He sighed again settling back into his chair. “I’m aware of the rumours surrounding you what Andrew and the townsfolk say. It’s not my place to judge but I can’t risk our business over someone we barely know. Dean doesn’t know you either. Why should we jeopardize everything over a girl who left a relationship unhappy? How is that fair to us?”  Embarrassment flushed my cheeks tears threatening in my eyes. He was right. I wasn’t worth the trouble. This was Andrew’s town not mine. I nodded in surrender and rose from my seat. “I understand.”  John stood beside me his hand lightly touching my arm. “I’m not trying to be harsh Y/N. But Dean doesn’t need this. He doesn’t need to worry about a girl he just met. He shouldn’t have to endure a town looking down on him because of your history. But he’s too stubborn to see it.”  I nodded again wiping away stray tears. “I know. I’ll make it clear to him Sir.”  Before he could respond I hurried out of the office passing Dean on my way to the car. He caught my arm concern etched on his face. “What happened? Where are you going?”  “Thanks for trying Dean. But this was a mistake. I shouldn’t have involved you.”  Confusion furrowed his brow but when he saw my tears anger flashed across his features. “What did my dad say?”  “Nothing that wasn’t true. I’m sorry. I have to go… I’ll call you later.”  Starting my car I sped away from the parking lot. When Dean was out of sight tears poured down my cheeks. I felt humiliated foolish and undeserving. How could I have thought things would ever be normal here? Why did I think a relationship with someone as wonderful as Dean could work when I was the town’s most despised?  Dean’s POV  I stormed into my dad’s office seething with anger. He met my glare with a stern expression. “What the hell did you say to her?”  He stepped closer his voice low. “Watch your tone Dean. I told her the truth—that having her around is costing us already. She didn’t have to leave she didn’t have to listen but she did. She knows she’s causing problems I don’t understand why you can’t see that.”  I scoffed and backed up. “Maybe because I’m the only one in this damn town who sees any good in her. Maybe I gave her a chance and when she showed her true colours I realized what a great person she is. Did it ever occur to you that Andrew might be the problem?”  He shook his head anger simmering. Crossing his arms he leaned against the wall. “That doesn’t matter Dean. Our business is everything. To survive we need to be on the right side.”  “And aligning with a guy who beats women is the right side?”  “Watch your mouth. Andrew has influence. What happens at home is not our concern.”  I scoffed again stepping towards the door. “You’re unbelievable. What if it were Mom in her position? Would you have treated her the same way?”  “Don’t you dare compare her to your mother.” His voice boomed on the walls.   “Swear to god what? You’ll hit me? Yeah because everybody in this town thinks with their fists. Go ahead prove me right dad.”  He stepped closer eyes glaring on me firsts clenched. “Dean I’m warning you.”  I moved closer unable to hold back my fury and hurt. “If it were Mom you’d do the exact same thing.”  Before I could react he grabbed my shirt slamming me against the wall. Pain shot through my back as his grip tightened around my throat.  “Your mother would never be in that situation. Y/N was foolish to get involved and you’re even more foolish for defending her.”  “I’m falling in love with her why can’t you support that!” I shouted watching his expression darken.  “You’re an idiot. You don’t love her.”  Pushing him away I rushed for the door. “I think I do and you won’t stop me from being with her. I care about her more than I care about Winchester Mechanics and you’d do the same if it were Mom.”  Back to me  I locked myself in the motel room collapsing against the wall as sobs racked my body. How could I have thought I’d find peace here? John was right. Dean was risking too much by being with me and he hardly knew me. I couldn’t take away his future his passion for cars all because of my tangled history with Andrew.  That’s why I decided to leave. I packed hastily preparing to depart and sort things out elsewhere. I couldn’t stay shouldn’t have stayed.  My phone rang displaying Dean’s name. I hesitated knowing he wouldn’t stop until I answered.  His messages flooded in each one a plea to talk. My heart raced. He was coming here? Panic surged. I couldn’t face him couldn’t bear to watch his heart break as I told him I was leaving for good. I had to go before he arrived.  I finished packing tossing everything into the car. As I closed the trunk I saw Dean’s truck pulling in. He must have raced here.   He hurried over pain and worry spread across on his face. “Sweetheart…”  I avoided his eyes “Dean don’t. It’s okay. I have to go.”  He glanced at the empty room behind me panic in his eyes. “Go where?”  I sighed turning to face him struggling to contain my tears. “I’m leaving town.”  The words felt like a knife in his gut. “Why are you leaving?”  “I don’t belong here Dean. I’m an outcast. Your dad was right. It’s not fair for me to jeopardize your future when you hardly know me.”  He scoffed gently reaching for my arm. “I do know you. I don’t understand why everyone keeps saying this. It hasn’t been long but I know you. I know about your broken leg when you were five from falling off a horse. I know you’re scared of dogs and hate the dark. I know you’ve always dreamed of going to New York and seeing Times Square. I know the way your nose crinkles when you’re lost in thought and how you tilt your head. And I know you don’t want to leave because you haven’t looked away from me this whole time.”  I slowly met his gaze tears welling in my eyes. “What am I supposed to do?”  “Stay with me. I’ll take care of you. I’ll help you.”  I stepped back arms wrapped around myself. “Dean if I stay I’m putting your future at risk.”  He moved closer his hands reaching out. “Fuck my future! Why does everyone care so much about my future? A job isn’t everything. It’s you.”  My heart skipped a beat his words hanging in the air. “What did you say?”  He sighed closing the distance between us. “It’s you. You’re my future. It hasn’t been long but I feel it. I know you feel it too. And I’ve only seen someone move this fast once before—my dad and my mom. I want what they have and I know I can have it with you. Please… just stay with me. I’ll take care of you.”  I couldn’t hold back anymore. I leaned into him kissing him softly before pulling away finding the courage to speak my heart. “I think I might love you Dean.”  A smile broke across his face and he kissed my forehead gently. “I think I love you too Y/N.”  I sighed resting my head against his chest finding peace in his embrace. “What do we do now? I can’t afford this motel room and I don’t have a job.”  “Well… since the job didn’t work out you could move into the apartment below mine. Or… move in with me.”  “Dean…”  He grinned looking down at me. “Hey you said you didn’t want to ask too much of me. Technically it’s just one thing.”  I smiled through my tears nodding. “You’re right Detective Winchester. Are you sure?”  “More sure than anything. It’s up to you—you can take the apartment or with me. Either way works for me.”  “I want to live with you.”  His eyes widened joy lighting up his face. “Really?”  “Like you said my future is with you. We might as well start now even though I think we are absolutely crazy.”  He nodded giving me the address before heading to his truck to meet me there. For the first time in a while I felt hope that things were heading in the right direction—all because of Dean. I prayed that moving in together would work out.  Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it! Chapter 5 coming soon stay tuned!  Like comment and reblog feedback is my fuel 💕,2024-07-11 22:03:45 GMT

Up today s5e8: Changing Channels.  Sam comes home to the boys’ bright sunny apartment to find that Dean has been shirking his research in favor of entertaining a bikini-clad lady. Oh and there’s a laugh track. What? Rewind. A few days earlier the boys are investigating the death of a man with anger-management problems who seems to have been killed by the Incredible Hulk. Sam suspects the Trickster and suggests trying to convince him to help them stop the apocalypse. When they go to an abandoned warehouse thinking they have a lead on where the Trickster will be they get zapped into a hospital where everyone thinks they are doctors doctors who seem to be caught up in a great deal of personal drama. The boys are stuck on TV making their way through a number of shows including Doctor Sexy Dean’s “guilty pleasure” medical drama. They catch the Trickster and he tells them to “play their roles” before disappearing. With the help of Cas they figure out the Trickster must actually be an angel trap him in holy fire and make him explain himself. He’s Gabriel and he insists Sam and Dean must play their roles in the apocalypse and that the boys mirror the conflict in Heaven with Dean the faithful son (Michael) and Sam the rebellious one who chaffed under his father’s rules (Lucifer). Dean rejects all this but they are both shaken.  Below is a log of our real-time reactions as we watched. Remember that there may be spoilers for any part of SPN’s 15-season run here.

Up today s5e8: Changing Channels.  Sam comes home to the boys’ bright sunny apartment to find that Dean has been shirking his research in favor of entertaining a bikini-clad lady. Oh and there’s a laugh track. What? Rewind. A few days earlier the boys are investigating the death of a man with anger-management problems who seems to have been killed by the Incredible Hulk. Sam suspects the Trickster and suggests trying to convince him to help them stop the apocalypse. When they go to an abandoned warehouse thinking they have a lead on where the Trickster will be they get zapped into a hospital where everyone thinks they are doctors doctors who seem to be caught up in a great deal of personal drama. The boys are stuck on TV making their way through a number of shows including Doctor Sexy Dean’s “guilty pleasure” medical drama. They catch the Trickster and he tells them to “play their roles” before disappearing. With the help of Cas they figure out the Trickster must actually be an angel trap him in holy fire and make him explain himself. He’s Gabriel and he insists Sam and Dean must play their roles in the apocalypse and that the boys mirror the conflict in Heaven with Dean the faithful son (Michael) and Sam the rebellious one who chaffed under his father’s rules (Lucifer). Dean rejects all this but they are both shaken.  Below is a log of our real-time reactions as we watched. Remember that there may be spoilers for any part of SPN’s 15-season run here.

One day you will be able to thank him but not yet.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; You wanted to move on shed the skin you once let envelope you. No more credit card scams. No more endless days on the road. When you found evidence of a hunt you pulled out your phone book and found someone nearby to handle it. You knew deep down under the guilt and grief Sam would need to move on that he wanted to get out once and for all. So you were trying not just for yourself but for him as well. It was foolish really. How long could you have kept pretending before the facade would shatter.   It was late you had just clocked off and were tired from collecting mediocre tips from musty old men. Sam wanted to keep hunting down Lilith and you half expected him to be on the road chasing down a lead again. But no he was sitting on the shitty couch you had poached from an alley to fill space in the dump you were squating in. There wasn’t a glass in his hand but you knew it was somewhere. It was never far.   “Y/N?” he called   “Honey I’m home” you joked without much energy knowing he probably wouldn’t register it. By the time you stumbled home smelling of stale beer he was usually drunk or asleep.   But he did hear it. And when you dropped your things beside him on the arm of the couch and stood in front of him he mumbled “I wish that were real.”  “I am real” you told him stepping closer to smooth the hair from his face. He shook his head solemnly.   “No I wish those words were real.”  You were confused or at least hoping you were. “Sam? You’re not making any sense.”  “I want you to mean them” he murmured his eyes closed to the feeling of your hands in his hair. Was the ache in your chest the feeling of your heart breaking or struggling to repair itself?  “Honey” you murmured back urged on by the fragility of his own voice. He tensed. “Or would you prefer I call you Baby? Sweetheart?”  The last one was teasing - that’s what Dean called you. Or Princess when you got on his nerves. The expression on Sam’s face told you he had not taken it as a joke. You released our hand from his hair with one last brush from his forehead down to the end of the strands. He was letting it grow out a bit those boyish bangs long gone.   He groaned and you realized that he wasn’t as drunk as you thought. In fact he was hardly more than tipsy. His arms wrapped around your waist and slotted you securely between his open legs.   “Not ‘Sweetheart’” he said tightly. You nodded suddenly serious.   “What do you want then love?”  His head was buried in your dirty work shirt. You had both arms cradling his head to your chest as he leaned against you his legs locking you in. He was holding on like you were his one connection to sanity - one final tether he couldn’t afford to let go of.   It was a bad idea. But you couldn’t manage to say those words out loud when Sam’s hands shifted and followed a thrumming path up your back. Slowly they trailed to your shoulder then down your arms where your hair stood on end. He gently undid your twined arms and set them at your sides.   “Sam?”  A horrendous silence then the quietest of confessions breathy and close to a groan. “I’m sorry.”  “For what?” you asked carefully like approaching an injured animal.   “Everything. You name it. The drinking the anger keeping you here when I shouldn’t. All of it.”  “Oh Sammy.” You shook your head. “Don’t apologise.”  That seemed to aggravate him further because he detached himself from you completely and sat back until he was contorted in the cushions on the couch. Somehow he managed to make his imposing frame seem vulnerable when he hunched like that.   You crawled beside him tucking yourself into his rough angles.   “Talk to me. What’s wrong?”  He sucked in a breath. “Am I the one that deserves to live?”  He didn’t have to explain you understood completely. Dean made a stupid sacrifice to save his brother. The last year was full of pure desperation and waning hope as Sam fought to fix the mistake that should never have been made. He didn’t consider himself saving. He saw himself as the reason Dean was in Hell. He would switch places in an instant. He thought he deserved it. They were both so stubborn.   “Dean made his choice. And as awful as it is that we were unable to save him he wouldn’t want you to let this ruin the life he knew you deserve.”  Sam swallowed. He wouldn’t accept it but he also wouldn’t dispute you.   So before the moment from earlier passed completely you dragged a hand along his jaw gently angling his head towards you. His eyes pink around the edges and watery stared up with an expression that quickly turned from gentle to dangerous.   “So what are you going to do with your life Baby?”  He laughed like he couldn’t believe you just said that. “It sounds like you have something specific in mind.”    Then you let your mouth take over from where your hands once were on his face. He was scruffy and his hands were rough when they gripped tight to your hair and forced you deeper as his mouth locked with yours.   “I want you. But-”  Sam slid a hand up your shirt and destroyed whatever residence you had. You had always considered Sam a gentle giant. He was patient and resourceful and kind. He read five different languages half of them ancient and dead. He looked a little uncomfortable in a suit - like every time was the first time although that was beginning to change. He loved and hated his brother equally but would always choose him over anything and everything. He wanted so much for the stuff he could never have that he had told himself to stop asking.   You anticipated something slow; burning but gentle. Full of love with the side effect of passion. You imagined - all those times you imagined - that same kind of patience reflected in the attention he would pay you. A lover that gives and never demands that holds on with a worry that you might break. One you would have to coax out of his shell. You had accepted that it would be beautiful and luxurious and a tad bit gentle. And that would be fine. It would be Sam.   But then Sam hauled you onto his lap and grunted “this okay?” into your ear before he began to kiss down your neck and shove your shirt over your head. That’s when you realized that you had it all wrong. He had been hiding something he was now prepared to unleash. His kisses were fierce but never unwieldy. There was a possession to his touch as if he was mapping out his claim.   You didn’t know how to answer this question besides panting a yes and struggling with his own shirt tearing it off him with unknown urgency. The skin revealed was scarred and tanned from the summer sun. On his lower left rib cage you noticed the slash from a particularly vicious harpy. You trace it with your finger and grin as his muscles tense beneath the skin.   Dean his instincts quick but not quick enough had put his foot heavy on the pedal and raced not to the hospital but back to you the next town over. You were taking care of a quick salt and burn Sam had found in his research. The boys arrived at a frightful hour clothes bloody and the Impala reeking of death. Sam’s torso had clenched muscles prominent under his pale skin as you doused the wound with alcohol - the medical antiseptic kind even though the boys tended to rely on whatever booze was closest. Sam had hissed through clenched teeth as you began to clean the wound and prepare the needle to stitch it up. Dean had been attending to his own wounds - a gnarly sprained finger and several shallow cuts. Her talons had been vicious.   With every taut stretch of the needle and thread Sam let out a whispering groan. Dean poured a tall glass of bourbon and handed it to his brother. Sam gulped it down barely twisting his face at all at the taste.   “At least pretend you’re not an alcoholic” You teased as you tucked in for the final stitch. Sam opened his mouth to answer but he quickly clamped it shut and gritted his teeth as you tied it all shut and wrapped him up. “All done.”  Back on that second-hand couch in the dilapidated room you smoothed a hand over his shoulder and down to his chest relishing in the heat and soft brush of hair. There he was lost but rediscovered under your touch. Was it the beginning or the end of a decade of longing? The catalyst or the detonator?  Sam decided on the next move. He studied you with a desperate hungry stare lingering on the flush of your lips. The rushed movements had paused it was cautious now like he had come to a new realization and he had found it in your image. The next time when he kissed you it was overwhelming. With a self-satisfied look he purposefully arranged you deep in his lap. You still had your bra on but the rest of your chest and abdomen were pressed tight to his slightly sweaty and clinging. You could feel every rise and fall of his chest with breath.   You wanted to ask why - why this why now? - but were scared of the answer. What explanation could possibly satisfy you besides one that matched your own. You had followed this man to the ends of the earth. And now in his darkest moment you were allowing him to kiss you with all the energy he had left in his soul. You wanted him to say it was love not lust and loneliness.   “You’ve been practising.”  It made him bark out a laugh. “It’s been a long time since we were seventeen on the hood of that car.”  As he spoke one of his hands delved down past your hips cradling your ass still trapped in the stiff denim of your jeans. But the other hand was on a different mission. As you clutched tight around his neck he began to palm between your legs. The first flutter of pleasure caught in your throat.   “And I’ve wanted to do this all this time.”  “Me too” you agree the friction increasing but never enough. “What else did seventeen year old Sam want?”  “I’m not sure he ever thought it would get this far.”  You reached to unhook your bra and leaned back so you could tug the straps off. Sam grinned with that same complete uninhibited desire you could feel in his kisses. Then those devilish touches were rising up again caressing the swell of your breasts with a particular consuming need that forced your head back. His mouth lingered on your neck but found a new home. It shot a bolt of instant heady warmth to that burning centre as you ground down desperate from the withdrawn friction. You found it against his leg denim on denim the pressure points alight.   “What do you want?” he asked as you snapped his head up with a yank of his hair. He raised his eyebrows as he jerked his own hips.   You dragged your gaze down settling at the collision of your thighs in desperation. Then you swept back up looking at him with dark eyes.   “Give me everything you got Sammy.”  There was no flirty response. Sam took to this challenge like he did all things - with brutal precision and tense concentration. This time his teeth caught your lower lip. This time his hands tugged down your zipper with force. This time he threw you down on the couch. You were out of breath as you watched him tug your pants down then reach for his belt. The leather slithered out of the loops. You clenched around the insufferable absence.   Sam noticed. He dragged his gaze up to where your hands were up above your head already clutching at the armrest and smirked.   “Do you like to be tied up?” He asked with equal parts awe and teasing.   “I said give me everything didn’t I?”  Sam licked his teeth and motioned for you to bring your hands forward. He slipped the strap around them cinching it tight enough to restrain but not enough to hurt. Then he pushed your arms back down and devoured your mouth with his own. Your hips struggled against his but he was uncommonly patient. You could sense the desperation in him but he managed to contain it partly. But when you found a swift course of friction and let out a hoarse groan you could see the control faltering - like a dog with a choke collar. You wanted to let him free.   You locked eyes with him and said plainly although a little out of breath “Sam please I want you so bad. Fuck me just fuck me already.”  But he had tugged down your underwear and dragged the fabric all the way down your thighs. The button and zipper of his jeans were undone and you could see the press of grey cotton straining. Holy Mother of God.  At this point no blood had yet passed Sam’s lips besides his own when his lip was split or his nose was bloody and broken. Ruby was dead for all you knew as was Dean. There was no hope except what you could create for yourself. Your dad still kept his secret closely guarded you had no idea the role you would play. No idea how long the universe had struggled to create this moment. All that existed was the feeling of Sam between your legs in worship.   “Keep making those sounds sweets.”  “I-” you tried but his tongue had driven a perfect line straight to your clit. “I thought you didn’t like ‘sweetheart’”  Sam hummed and the vibrations were sinful. “Never said I couldn’t say it. And I didn’t say sweetheart.”  “Sounded awfully close” you panted and Sam paused. In fact he almost completely stopped. He raised his head and you felt the pleasant desperation of wanting to cling to his hair and press him back down again - but your hands were tied.   Sam smirked and raised an eyebrow. “Are you complaining?”  “No.”  “Do you want me to continue?”  “God yes.”  “Good.”   His fingers moved from gripping your soft inner thigh to slipping inside you. One then two. His jaw clenched and you had a flashback to what precipitated this - the anger and the sadness and the intense suffering that lived within him. And so you held on with all you could. When Sam drifted up you caught him looping your arms to cradle him. All those instincts of love were there they were always there. He was just yet to notice them. But you said it to yourself in your head. I love you Sam unable to speak them aloud.   That first jolt had you trembling. Then it rose - a wave fighting its way to the shore pulled into the undertow. Your body clenched around that growing burning orbit of pleasure. Sam’s breath was heavy your whines keened into his ear. His hands grew frantic forcing you to the inevitable collapse that had you shaking beneath him.   “That’s it baby cum for me.”  You chanted his name in answer rushing forward into the blazing light. You repeated his name like a question like a promise like a calling. He urged you on matching you stroke for stroke. The clouds broke the rain fell. And when it was all over gasping for air you remembered that it was a bad idea.     tags  @halo-mystic   @losers-club6  @badbishsblog  @its-not-too-late-for-coffee,2024-07-12 01:26:02 GMT

0,Supernatural,['dean winchester'  'destiel'  'deancas'],the--karkats--pajamas,It’s probably been said a thousand times but the morning routine scene in supernatural 15x20 really demonstrated to me that Dean was absolutely not okay. Like he looks okay happy music is playing over it and everything but he’s clearly not himself. Dean isn’t always the tidiest guy obviously but he respects his space he loves having somewhere that’s his his bed his room his kitchen. Because he never had that growing up.   And we see that a lot throughout the series his pride at his memory foam mattress and him glaring at Sam when he left trash on his floor when they first get the bunker but also later on whenever we see his room it’s clean and tidy not a thing out of place (aside from the fact he doesn’t fold his clothes).  But in this scene he wakes up and gets dressed sloppily throwing his clothes on whatever surface is around and there’s clothing having off the backs of chairs like he’s been doing this for a while. And he makes his bed halfway before just kinda giving up.  Sam is up earlier than him which tracks but then Sam is also the one to make breakfast which again isn’t that weird inherently but that’s something Dean usually enjoys doing. And then dean is very sloppy with the dishes flinging soapy water on his kitchen counter. Again disrespecting his space.  He’s a man going through the motions. The happy music and the cute dog and the way he’s doing everything he’s supposed to be doing are a distraction. Because he’s doing it all wrong. Dean Winchester is a shell.  Or maybe I’m reading too much into it but whatever that’s what we do here!,2024-07-12 02:33:41 GMT

Dean x reader one shot! Summary: Dean Winchester the man who came and went that seemed like in a blink of an eye. But he left some thing behind your Daughter.  Paring: Dean x reader   word count: 2.4k  Divider from  Firefly Graphics  Reblog Banner and 18+ Banner From  cafekitsune  Warnings: swearing MILD SMUT Feelings all around  AN/ So I got very inspired by seeing posts of how Dean deserved to be a dad! Here is my story of that and this would take place after season 15 so he is alive and happy! Hope you enjoy!  Six Years since I last saw Dean Winchester the man that came and left in an blink of an eye. The charming yet somewhat earnest type that I always fell for helped that he was hot as hell. Those crystal green eyes white prince smile glitter freckle kissed skin that almost made you believe in miracles. I was the waitress at the restaurant where he and his partner went every night while they were in town trying to find a missing person and thankfully they did but with that came a goodbye. But he did leave me with something not an std but our daughter.  I wanted to tell him so many times but how was I supposed to tell this barely a familiar hook up that he had a kid. When he left he told me that he liked me and maybe if he was staying around we could try something but he wasn’t. I found out I was pregnant with Bella two weeks later. So was I really going to tell a guy I didn’t even really know that he was a dad and potentially ruin his career and break my heart if he told me to screw off. The answer was no.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; So here I was six years later with the best little girl in the world and trying my best. “Hey mom could you please pick Bella up? I have to pick up this shift.” I was balancing my phone between my shoulder and ear while my hands were full of plates of food while I was widing through the sticky tables. “Of course sweetie I’ll see you at eight.” My mom has been my biggest supporter since the day I was pregnant.”Ok thank you so much love you bye oh and don’t let her eat so much ice cream again she threw up all over the couch last time.” “I’m her grandma I’m supposed to spoil her.” “Bye Mom.” I said in a loving jokey way.   It was almost seven thirty when I was walking up to my table and had just gotten satten. I was carrying two glasses of water to the table when I heard a voice that I thought I would never hear again. “Oh Hey Y/n right? You’re still working here that’s cool.” I look up and drop the water. It was Dean fucking Winchester. “Whoa you okay?” he swooped down to help pick up the pieces of now broken glasses. I can’t even look at him. “Hey Y/n” He grabbed my hand I didn’t realize but it was bleeding. “Are you okay?” I barely get a word out. “Hey can I get a towel or bandaid please!?”   He called out and a co-worker ran over. “Is she okay?” “Dean I’m fine.” My friend’s eyes widened knowing that name. “Uh why don’t you take a break? I’ll bring more waters” I begged with my body for her to stay but she ignored me knowing that was not her place. We sat down in the booth. I kept staring at my bloody hand hoping it was a terrible nightmare but then he spoke again.   “I know it’s been a while since I’ve been here but I swear that I had good reason to. I had to take care of something that took longer than expected. I wanted to come back. I’ve missed this place you.” My heart flutters a little. “It’s okay not like you had something to come back to.” I know that’s a little harsh but I was trying to drive him away as quickly as possible. “Well you’re here and I don’t know about you but I had an amazing time when I was last here.”   My head flashed back to that night the last night he was here we were together for hours in the sheets. It wasn’t just sex but we talked about our hopes and dreams. Maybe that’s why I wanted to talk to him a little longer. “I guess you’re right it wasn’t half bad.” I smirked. “Half Bad? Excuse me but I believe you were the one begging for more-” Before he can go on I kick him. “Fine you were great happy.”   “Very happy hey did you ever go to college for acting.” what? He remembered my dream not even boyfriends who had been with me for a long time remembered that. “I can’t believe you still know that.” “How could I forget your face lit up talking about it every time.” We both smiled thinking about those times. But the air froze when we heard another voice. “Mommy! I can’t wait to show you my drawing!” Bella ran over and jumped in my lap. I looked at the clock and it was eight fifteen shit.   “Oh baby I’m sure it’s so beautiful I’ll look at home okay.” “But Mommy!” I started to try to get up but being a six year old she was dragging her feet. “But Momma!” “Bella! Let’s go!” I hated it when my yelling voice came out. I finally looked at Dean and he looked like he had been slapped in the face. “Hey mister would you like to see?” She asked Dean kindly like I had taught her. “Bella he’s busy-” “I would love to.” She pulled out a picture and it was a drawing of a family.   “You see that’s me and mommy and that’s grandma.” He nods looking out the picture. “It’s really good Hey do you have a daddy Bella?” He asked the question I had been fearing. “No I don’t.” She answered so quickly and without thought it broke my heart. “And how old are you Bella?” “I’m this many” She holds up six fingers. Dean just sits there thinking. “Bella could you go back to your grandma?” She seems sad. “You can get ice cream!” I tried. Of course she jumps up and runs to the counter. I sit back down at the booth sighing. “Dean I-” he holds up his hand with tears in his eyes. “I just have one question. Is she my daughter?” “Yes.”  It had been at least twenty minutes. I broke the ice. “Dean I don’t even know where to start.” “How about you start why you kept my fucking child away from me?” He was mad of course who wouldn’t be. “Dean you have to understand why I did it I didn’t tell you because I knew what kind of job you had and that you couldn’t just drop everything. I mean you told me you couldn’t stay.” “You don’t think my kid would change that!?” I had tears building up.   “I didn’t know you Dean I didn’t want a guy to tell me to screw off that I was just starting to really like and that I knew you just couldn’t stay.” He’s silent again. “I want to know her.” I’m a little shocked. “Dean I know it was fucked up of me to keep this from you but you can’t just go away because of a job or something that needs you for weeks I won’t allow Bella to be hurt like that.” He did not hesitant “I won’t.”   And from there on out it was kind of nice. We had set up a system where Bella could spend time with Dean so we didn’t freak her out when we told her. I could really see both of them loving each other. I met his brother and he was very surprised to hear he had a niece. Bella loved spending time with both of them. It had been a couple of months. The more time we all spent together the more my heart became comfortable with Dean around that’s what terrified me.  We were eating Chinese food with Bella and for the first time I felt like we had a family but then his damn phone rang. He checked the name and I saw his face fall a little from his previous smile but he was keeping it together for us. “Uh hey what’s up?” I couldn’t hear everything but I did hear the level of the voice and it was not calm.   “Yeah I’ll be there.” He responded back. He hangs up and looks at me. “Dean no no you promised-” “I know I did and trust me I don’t want to go but I have to. This friend needs me.” We need you I need you but of course I didn’t say that out loud. He gets up to get his things and bends down to Bella’s level. “Hey Bells I’ll be back in a little.” She clearly doesn’t want him to go. “But we were going to play barbies after dinner.” She whined in true six-year-old fashion.   “I know and promise as soon as I get back we will and I’ll bring back a new Barbie friend how about that.” She leaps in his arms. “Yay! Thank you Dean I love you.” Dean and I both got stiff at that it was the first I love you between them. He squeezes her harder at that. “I love you too Bella.” He lets go and goes to the front door and I follow.   “How long are you going to be gone?” “I honestly don’t know Y/n I wished I did.” At that I got angry he fucking promised. “Dean what kind of Job do you have that you don’t know when you’ll be home!?” He put his hands on the sides of my face. “I will tell you everything when I get home.” He saw my uneasy face. He leans down I think for a kiss but not where I was expecting. It was my forehead a slow caring one. “You have no idea what you guys mean to me. I will come back and explain everything.” With that he leaves.  I put Bella to bed hours ago and it was five in the morning but I couldn’t go to bed not knowing he was safe. Finally the door creaks open but very quietly. It was Dean but he looked like he walked through Hell. “Hey what are you still doing up?” I sip my coffee not really having the anger anymore but being replaced with worry. That’s when I knew I was in deep shit I was falling in love with Dean Winchester. “I couldn’t sleep not knowing you were safe.” There is just silence between us. I look up and can’t hold back anymore and run into his safe arms. We are like this for like two minutes. “I think it’s time I tell you what I really did you might want to sit down for this.”   “So you’re saying everything I’ve ever told Bella was fake is real.” “Yes” “And God Angels the Devil Demons are real.” “Yup and actually an Angel is one of my best friends.” I gulp the rest of my coffee down maybe thinking this was a dream and I would wake but no this was real. “Okay I somehow believe you.” “Really some people call Sam and me crazy when we have to tell them.” “Well I know both you and Sam and you’re not liars.” “Thank you.” “No problem.” I break the ice once more. “So that’s why you had to leave to help someone.”   “Yeah an old friend was going to a vamp nest.” He looked down at my confused face. “Sorry I’ll explain all the monster lore another time.” “A vamp nest sounds dangerous Dean.” “it is.” I let out what I was thinking the whole night. “Dean I don’t want to tell you what to do but you can’t just go out anymore like that not when you have a kid now and not when I- “ I was stopped by his lips on mine and it was like nothing changed. We let go.   “I’m sorry if I was reading that wrong Y/n but I care about you too and Bella and thank Chuck every day that he gave me you too.” “Chuck?” He chuckles. “More lore but this is way more important.” He gripped my hips and pulled me forward like he did six years ago. “Wait Dean before we go further even though I would love to relive how we made Bella I need to know this is a hundred percent real and this isn’t another in-the-moment type thing.” He kisses me deeply again. “I’m a thousand percent for you and our family.” Our family I never thought I would hear those words and that did me in.  SMUT …………………………………………………………………………………………………..  I pull him in and kiss him again but this time put some real feeling in it. He slips his tongue in like it was natural. “Mhh Dean.” “Would you like to move this to the bed?” I jump up and he catches me. “Yes sir.” He walks me to my bedroom and kicks the door open and lays me down. He gets on top and starts to kiss down my neck. “Lets see I think this is where your special spot is right?” He sucks down on my pressure point and I mewl with pleasure.   “Ding ding ding we have a winner.” He said slyly. “Dean please no teasing it’s been six years.” “Aww darling did I get you all worked up.” “Dean fucking Win-” He goes down to my thighs and starts to pull off my shorts and underwear. “You already soaked baby is this all for me?” He starts to rub his finger up and down my slit. I barely answer. “Uh-huh.” “That’s it baby just feel me.” he puts his finger in my pussy. “AHH DEAN!” I grip his wrist.   “Shh you don’t want to wake Bells.” “Oh you motherfucker!” He goes faster and faster. “Are you almost there?” “Yes!” He speeds all the way up. “Okay let go.” And I came all over his fingers. “Ahh I missed that.” “You son of a-” I laughed and dragged him into another kiss. It was starting to get heavy again and he was unbuckling quickly. “Are you sure about this?” he asked earnestly. “A thousand percent.” He smiled his goofy smile and went on. But something stopped the both of us. “Mommy moma!” I look down at his tent. “I’ll go but we’ll continue this later.” I leave him with a lingering kiss and him thinking he is the luckiest guy in the world.

Dean x reader one shot! Summary: Dean Winchester the man who came and went that seemed like in a blink of an eye. But he left some thing behind your Daughter.  Paring: Dean x reader   word count: 2.4k  Divider from  Firefly Graphics  Reblog Banner and 18+ Banner From  cafekitsune  Warnings: swearing MILD SMUT Feelings all around  AN/ So I got very inspired by seeing posts of how Dean deserved to be a dad! Here is my story of that and this would take place after season 15 so he is alive and happy! Hope you enjoy!  Six Years since I last saw Dean Winchester the man that came and left in an blink of an eye. The charming yet somewhat earnest type that I always fell for helped that he was hot as hell. Those crystal green eyes white prince smile glitter freckle kissed skin that almost made you believe in miracles. I was the waitress at the restaurant where he and his partner went every night while they were in town trying to find a missing person and thankfully they did but with that came a goodbye. But he did leave me with something not an std but our daughter.  I wanted to tell him so many times but how was I supposed to tell this barely a familiar hook up that he had a kid. When he left he told me that he liked me and maybe if he was staying around we could try something but he wasn’t. I found out I was pregnant with Bella two weeks later. So was I really going to tell a guy I didn’t even really know that he was a dad and potentially ruin his career and break my heart if he told me to screw off. The answer was no.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; So here I was six years later with the best little girl in the world and trying my best. “Hey mom could you please pick Bella up? I have to pick up this shift.” I was balancing my phone between my shoulder and ear while my hands were full of plates of food while I was widing through the sticky tables. “Of course sweetie I’ll see you at eight.” My mom has been my biggest supporter since the day I was pregnant.”Ok thank you so much love you bye oh and don’t let her eat so much ice cream again she threw up all over the couch last time.” “I’m her grandma I’m supposed to spoil her.” “Bye Mom.” I said in a loving jokey way.   It was almost seven thirty when I was walking up to my table and had just gotten satten. I was carrying two glasses of water to the table when I heard a voice that I thought I would never hear again. “Oh Hey Y/n right? You’re still working here that’s cool.” I look up and drop the water. It was Dean fucking Winchester. “Whoa you okay?” he swooped down to help pick up the pieces of now broken glasses. I can’t even look at him. “Hey Y/n” He grabbed my hand I didn’t realize but it was bleeding. “Are you okay?” I barely get a word out. “Hey can I get a towel or bandaid please!?”   He called out and a co-worker ran over. “Is she okay?” “Dean I’m fine.” My friend’s eyes widened knowing that name. “Uh why don’t you take a break? I’ll bring more waters” I begged with my body for her to stay but she ignored me knowing that was not her place. We sat down in the booth. I kept staring at my bloody hand hoping it was a terrible nightmare but then he spoke again.   “I know it’s been a while since I’ve been here but I swear that I had good reason to. I had to take care of something that took longer than expected. I wanted to come back. I’ve missed this place you.” My heart flutters a little. “It’s okay not like you had something to come back to.” I know that’s a little harsh but I was trying to drive him away as quickly as possible. “Well you’re here and I don’t know about you but I had an amazing time when I was last here.”   My head flashed back to that night the last night he was here we were together for hours in the sheets. It wasn’t just sex but we talked about our hopes and dreams. Maybe that’s why I wanted to talk to him a little longer. “I guess you’re right it wasn’t half bad.” I smirked. “Half Bad? Excuse me but I believe you were the one begging for more-” Before he can go on I kick him. “Fine you were great happy.”   “Very happy hey did you ever go to college for acting.” what? He remembered my dream not even boyfriends who had been with me for a long time remembered that. “I can’t believe you still know that.” “How could I forget your face lit up talking about it every time.” We both smiled thinking about those times. But the air froze when we heard another voice. “Mommy! I can’t wait to show you my drawing!” Bella ran over and jumped in my lap. I looked at the clock and it was eight fifteen shit.   “Oh baby I’m sure it’s so beautiful I’ll look at home okay.” “But Mommy!” I started to try to get up but being a six year old she was dragging her feet. “But Momma!” “Bella! Let’s go!” I hated it when my yelling voice came out. I finally looked at Dean and he looked like he had been slapped in the face. “Hey mister would you like to see?” She asked Dean kindly like I had taught her. “Bella he’s busy-” “I would love to.” She pulled out a picture and it was a drawing of a family.   “You see that’s me and mommy and that’s grandma.” He nods looking out the picture. “It’s really good Hey do you have a daddy Bella?” He asked the question I had been fearing. “No I don’t.” She answered so quickly and without thought it broke my heart. “And how old are you Bella?” “I’m this many” She holds up six fingers. Dean just sits there thinking. “Bella could you go back to your grandma?” She seems sad. “You can get ice cream!” I tried. Of course she jumps up and runs to the counter. I sit back down at the booth sighing. “Dean I-” he holds up his hand with tears in his eyes. “I just have one question. Is she my daughter?” “Yes.”  It had been at least twenty minutes. I broke the ice. “Dean I don’t even know where to start.” “How about you start why you kept my fucking child away from me?” He was mad of course who wouldn’t be. “Dean you have to understand why I did it I didn’t tell you because I knew what kind of job you had and that you couldn’t just drop everything. I mean you told me you couldn’t stay.” “You don’t think my kid would change that!?” I had tears building up.   “I didn’t know you Dean I didn’t want a guy to tell me to screw off that I was just starting to really like and that I knew you just couldn’t stay.” He’s silent again. “I want to know her.” I’m a little shocked. “Dean I know it was fucked up of me to keep this from you but you can’t just go away because of a job or something that needs you for weeks I won’t allow Bella to be hurt like that.” He did not hesitant “I won’t.”   And from there on out it was kind of nice. We had set up a system where Bella could spend time with Dean so we didn’t freak her out when we told her. I could really see both of them loving each other. I met his brother and he was very surprised to hear he had a niece. Bella loved spending time with both of them. It had been a couple of months. The more time we all spent together the more my heart became comfortable with Dean around that’s what terrified me.  We were eating Chinese food with Bella and for the first time I felt like we had a family but then his damn phone rang. He checked the name and I saw his face fall a little from his previous smile but he was keeping it together for us. “Uh hey what’s up?” I couldn’t hear everything but I did hear the level of the voice and it was not calm.   “Yeah I’ll be there.” He responded back. He hangs up and looks at me. “Dean no no you promised-” “I know I did and trust me I don’t want to go but I have to. This friend needs me.” We need you I need you but of course I didn’t say that out loud. He gets up to get his things and bends down to Bella’s level. “Hey Bells I’ll be back in a little.” She clearly doesn’t want him to go. “But we were going to play barbies after dinner.” She whined in true six-year-old fashion.   “I know and promise as soon as I get back we will and I’ll bring back a new Barbie friend how about that.” She leaps in his arms. “Yay! Thank you Dean I love you.” Dean and I both got stiff at that it was the first I love you between them.

I was recently asked to do a tutorial for two friends and I figured I’d share it here! It’s on how I personally use markers and colored pencils for portraits so if that’s something you’re interested in then this is for you!  I must preface by saying this is my first tutorial/guide thingy and I’m no professional but hopefully it helps some! This is only one way of going about it don’t worry if it’s not your way!   Without further ado let’s do this! And remember: Trust the process!!!   &lt;!-- more --&gt; First the angelic (😏) reference:  Now we all see tones differently. I also am using the Art Alternatives Portrait Set which is limited in tones. So this won’t be completely picture accurate- which is okay! Essence over accuracy!  Alright! Here we go!  Step One: the sketch!  Typically I do the sketch in the person’s undertone usually pinks or purples. However for whatever reason I was compelled to try blue on this one and hey- what is art if not random attempts at creating beauty?  And just like the color scheme the sketch isn’t 100% accurate. But again it’s all good!  But anyways the reason I do my sketches in colored pencil is because it doesn’t smudge like graphite does and it actually blends into the marker. I feel it’s smoother and it provides some undertones as you start layering with marker.   Step Two: base tones  This is where you wonder if you just destroyed the entire drawing. I promise you that you didn’t! Basically what I do here is I put pinks down wherever I see pinks in the reference and lay down where the skin is the darkest. I find that it blends better when it’s underneath the base layer.   Step Three: the base layer  Here all you do is throw down the skintone over the entirety of where it goes in this case the face. I typically try to leave out highlights but sometimes the marker bleeds and covers things I didn’t ask it to. In this case that was the eyes. Oh well!   One thing to notice here is how you can still see the colored pencil beneath the sketch. That’s a very useful guide for when you begin detailing.   Step 3.5: uh  This isn’t necessarily a marker step it’s just me letting the ink dry and working on other spots with pen and colored pencil. Also I do like to go over the pink areas a few times to make them less stark.   Step Four: beginning detailing   Now black is a tricky color on the face because it can either smudge on everything and turn it gray or work really well. I used a colored pencil here and began going over the blue colored pencil spots and lines that were visible under the marked which started to bring out his face. I also covered the highlight on the nose that had been left alone thus far.   Step Five: THE™️ details  If there’s anything I’ve learned in my five years of drawing it’s that the highlights and darkest points are what really make the piece. Pure white bright highlights (like the ones in the eyes) are awesome but lately I like smudging them out a little bit so that they’re gentler.   If there’s anything you want to hit it’s the whites of the eyes with the white gel pen and the pupils + nostrils with the black fineliner.   I have shaky hands but I use them to my advantage in stippling the darkest part of the eyebrows and in the line of the lips with the fineliner- it just adds a little bit more depth :)  Hair is its own thing I just sort of wing it. Black hair especially is not the easiest for me just because I find it difficult to bring out the shades in it. It’s not done at this step as I was trying to figure out how I was going to finish it.   I will also blend things out with both the skintone marker and a pink colored pencil just to get stuff to be smoother. If you’re going for semi realism/realism like me I highly recommend taking a reddish brown to do some freckles/skin texture with. You can’t see it too much in this picture and I didn’t want to overdo it since Cas/Misha doesn’t have that many freckles as far as I can see but it does make a difference.   Step Six: everything else  I did the jacket in colored pencil as well as the fake id!  If you have any questions let me know I’m happy to help!  Hope this is a decent guide :),2024-07-12 15:02:23 GMT

12,Supernatural,['supernatural fanfiction'  'destiel'  'destiel fanfiction'  'spn'  'shut up sena'  'sena writes'  'horror high by senashenta'],senashenta,Title: Horror High  Pairing: Destiel  Rating: NC-17 (in future chapters)  Warnings: Sex Violence  Summary: John Winchester plants his eldest son at Caspar High in Jacksonville because weird things have been happening there: people disappearing. People reappearing only dead and drained of all their bodily fluids. Cocoons. It’s up to Dean to figure out what’s stalking Caspar’s halls and deal with it accordingly; but then he meets the New Kid—newer than him even the New-New Kid—Castiel Novak and all his plans get severely derailed. Now Dean has to juggle the supernatural case—a really hungry jorogumo—and also the fact that he’s very quickly falling in love something that is absolutely forbidden by his dad.  Meanwhile Castiel shoved into the third new school in a year because his adoptive father—Chuck Shurley’s—job has them moving around a lot struggles to fit in at Caspar High not only because he’s the New Kid but because he’s the weird New Kid. Dean seems like a saving grace a harbor in a storm someone who doesn’t judge him—that is until Cas finds out about Dean’s night job. Cas’s life just got a whole lot stranger—but that doesn’t stop him from falling for Dean regardless.  Notes: This is my first time writing Destiel OR SPN (though I have written SPN AU in other fandoms) so please bear with me while I get my footing.  Also HH was originally supposed to be like a 10-page one-shot and the next thing I knew it was 79-pages-of-11-pt-Arial-and-counting and I was looking for places to divide it for chapters so. Yeah. This storyline kind of just took over my brain and became a THING.  Top Dean and Bottom Cas which I know is the reverse of how 90% of the fandom writes them but I am tentatively planning a sequel to HH (depending on how well it does or doesn’t go over) that will flip them around so be patient shhhh.  Cas is younger than Dean in this AU by like… six months. Dean’s official birthday is January 24th and I used Jimmy Novak’s birthday for Cas which is July 10th. Since they’re both in the same grade that makes Cas younger. Just accept it and move on.  I have never been to Jacksonville or Florida so everything contained within this fic is completely fictitious; business names street names school names place names everything except Jacksonville Florida itself. :D  ALSO before anyone corrects me on stuff I am CANADIAN and I know the CANADIAN high school system/curriculum. I really have very little idea of how the US school system/classes work so like. I’m just making it up as I go. :D;; (Literally how many classes do US high school students have in a day?? Up here it’s FOUR.)  Please excuse my interpretation of jorogumos I took a LOT of liberties.  Chapter Two will be posted next Friday if you’re into that sort of thing. You can also read this HERE on AO3.  HORROR HIGH TUMBLR MASTER POST HERE.  HORROR HIGH Chapter One By Senashenta  Dean Winchester crept up the steps of Caspar High School in Jacksonville Florida and ducked under the line of police tape that marked off the area heading for the little tent that had been erected just to the side of the building near the bushes. The whole scene was theoretically being guarded by the police—but the officer they had left behind was asleep in his police car out front.  Bang up job Jacksonville P.D.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; That aside Dean was good at his job so sneaking into a crime scene was no big deal for him guarded or not. And this was just your basic body check there wouldn’t be any fighting or anything to wake the cop up—or that was the theory anyway. (Even if there was it wouldn’t be his first time being caught and or arrested either but they would probably just chalk it up to him being a nosy kid regardless.)  This was the first time his Dad had trusted him enough to drop him in a town to take care of a case alone. Of course Sam was in Jacksonville with Dean while their Dad headed to Utah to look into a recent spate of killings there but Sam was pretty much confined to school and the motel on this outing as per their father’s orders. Still Dean was going to be keeping a close eye on him: Sam had been known to rabbit in the past and he didn’t want to have to call his Dad and explain that he had lost his little brother (again.)  Now Dean stealthily unzipped the tent flap and stepped inside letting it fall closed behind himself.  What he was confronted with when his eyes adjusted to the darkness wasn’t a body so much as a cocoon an oblong rounded object the size of a person and wrapped in layers and layers of what looked almost like off-white cheesecloth or gauze. Dean leaned down and tapped at it with his fingers. It was soft like silk.  Well that would explain why the police hadn’t taken the body away yet; there was no body per se.  “Let’s see what’s inside you.”  Dean pulled the buck knife out of the back of his jeans unsheathed it and got to work cutting the cocoon open. The wrapping though soft was tough and sticky hard to slice through but eventually he hacked a seam lengthways along the cocoon at which point he set his knife aside to pull the damned thing open.  Inside was the actual body; male probably and curled in on itself shrivelled and desiccated and dried to a withered husk. At least it didn’t smell. Dean still made a face even as he released the cocoon and picked up his knife tucking it away again before exiting the little tent and heading off down the street making for the motel he and Sam were staying at.  The Seafoam Motel wasn’t exactly high-class but then none of the places they stayed at ever were. But it had walls and a roof good locks on the door it was cheap and nobody asked too many questions about the occupants of the rooms and those were all the important things. The Seafoam Motel ticked all the boxes for a financially strapped Hunter—and for his kids too. Not that you would know it from Sam’s complaining.  At least it had wifi the kid would have pitched an absolute fit if it hadn’t.  When he got back to the room the door was predictably locked (good job Sammy) and Dean banged on it a couple of times calling out “Sammy it’s me open the door!”  After a moment of silence there was the sound of the chain lock and deadbolt being unlocked and then the door was yanked open. Sam stepped aside to let Dean in and then closed and locked the door behind him just like it had been drilled into him so many times in the past. “What’d you find?”  “Cocoon.”  “Come again?”  “Cocoon.” Dean repeated as he crossed the room pulling his knife out and setting it on the little kitchenette table then dropping into one of the rickety chairs. “You know like the movie? The body was inside it. Wrapped up in this tough sticky… I don’t know what. But it sure looked a hell of a lot like a cocoon to me.”  Sam was already heading for his laptop. “That gives us a place to start at least.”  “Oh no no no.” Dean headed him off at the pass practically diving over and snatching the computer before Sam could get to it. “You’re not doing research all night we have freaking school in the morning.” And then “…I can’t believe I just said that.”  “Yeah because you care about school.” Sam rolled his eyes and made a grab for the laptop but Dean held it over his head where he couldn’t reach. “Dean.”  “I care about the girls at school.” He informed his brother with a grin then added “and it’s nearly two a.m. we’re going to bed. Research tomorrow. Sleep now. Besides I have to check out the school some more anyway just a cocoon isn’t going to give us much.”  Sam grumbled eventually agreed but still held his hand out for his computer. Dean deposited the laptop safely into his grasp and then started stripping down falling into bed once he was in just his boxers and a t-shirt. “Get the lights Sammy.”  Sam flicked the lights off with a long-suffering sigh.  – –  Castiel Novak wasn’t having a great first day at Caspar High. He was relatively used to being the New Kid his father’s job had them moving around a lot so he switched schools on a regular basis but the hazing at Caspar was particularly mean spirited he was finding not to mention the building itself was an absolute maze and he had been late for literally all of his morning classes simply because he hadn’t been able to find them and no one had been willing to help him out.  Now he was seated in the cafeteria by himself but surrounded by the rest of the bustling student body unsure what to really do with himself.  This wasn’t his first time being the New Kid. He and his father moved around a lot for his father’s job and Caspar High was the third school he’d transferred to since September. It was now January. His father promised that the moving would slow down though; he could see how much it wore on Cas even if the boy never said anything about it. He was going to start travelling for his seminars instead now that he felt Cas was old enough to stay home on his own. So Cas could potentially be at Caspar for a while.  He probably should have been worried about making friends. For most kids his age that would have been top priority but Cas had always been a little different and he thought he was fine on his own if it came down to it especially considering the first impression he was getting of the other students so far. It figured that the High School he was likely to actually graduate from would turn out to be full of nothing but jerks.  He was also possibly a little jaded from all the moving around he’d done in the past.  For the time being he just dug his lunch—a peanut butter and jelly sandwich an apple and a bottle of water—out of his backpack unwrapped the sandwich and began to pick little pieces of it off and eat them rather than taking proper bites as he usually would. He wasn’t really all that hungry considering there were at least a hundred pairs of eyes on him at the moment.  And then—  “HEY NEW KID!”  When Cas looked up a basketball was flying at his face and he had no time to duck out of the way—but at the last possible second hands shot out of nowhere snatching the ball out of the air before it could hit its’ target. Blue eyes blinked and his head swivelled sideways to take in the stranger that had just saved him from a black eye at the very least.  The guy wasn’t overly tall—probably around Cas’s height give or take—with short tousled brown hair. He was sporting a t-shirt and a flannel button-up under a worn black jean jacket. He was also wearing ripped jeans. But Cas was most taken by his eyes which were a sharp beautiful forest green. As he watched the other boy eyed the kid across the cafeteria who had thrown the ball to begin with—then abruptly pitched it back at the offender. The ball slammed into the other kid’s head sending him flying backward out of his seat and causing laugher to erupt all across the cafeteria.  Then his rescuer just looked down at him for a moment before dropping down to sit next to him straddling the bench. “They tried that on me my first day here too. Same thing happened then. You’d think they’d learn.”  “Thank you.” Cas offered with a blink.  “No problem.”  “I’m Castiel.”  “That’s a mouthful. I’m Dean.” And then “the fact that you’re wearing a tie right now isn’t going to help your popularity. Also” he reached over to physically pull the tie off Cas’s neck and dropped it on the table in front of them. Cas allowed it somewhat baffled. “You had it on backwards. Honestly dude just wear t-shirts like the rest of us.”  “I can do that.” Cas agreed. He owned t-shirts. He grabbed his tie to stuff it into his backpack. Then he returned to looking at Dean taking in his features and mannerisms. He was exceedingly good-looking Cas decided almost absently. At the same time Dean was looking him over as well seeming to take stock of him gaze alert and analytical. Scrutinizing.  Eventually Cas shifted a little and asked “are you new too?”  “New-ish.” Dean shrugged “I transferred in two weeks ago.”  “That’s why you’re nicer than…” Cas trailed off and glanced around the cafeteria.  “Literally everyone else here?” Dean suggested with a laugh.  “I didn’t want to say it but yes.”  “It gets better. After a few days they forget. They’re dumb like that the masses.”  “Zombies.”  “Uh” Dean hesitated but then allowed “yeah sure kind of.”  “You don’t sound very certain Dean.”  “Well Cas I just think zombies are probably different than in the movies.”  Wait. “Cas?” He called himself ‘Cas’ in his head but no one ever called him that out loud except his father.  Dean gave him a little amused look “’Castiel’ is a lot.”  “Oh. Okay.”  “As long as it’s fine with you that is.”  Cas nodded and offered a smile. “It’s fine with me.”  Dean gave him a little grin back. “Great.”  The rest of lunch hour was spent with Cas actually eating his lunch properly while he talked with Dean and they got to know each other a little. No one else bothered them for the rest of the time they were in the cafeteria and Cas was hoping he would have at least one of his afternoon classes with Dean but when they compared their schedules it sadly wasn’t to be. Cas resigned himself to hazing throughout the day for at least the next week or so—until the rest of the student body moved on.  It was a novelty to talk with someone who overlooked his innate strangeness. Cas was so used to people giving him odd looks that Dean chatting with him as freely as he was now was… almost baffling. Dean seemed like the kind of guy who could be popular have tons of friends easily and instead here he was wasting his time with Cas. It was… weird. Not that Cas was complaining.  When the bell rang to signify the end of lunch hour Cas was mildly disappointed that their conversation had to end. He shifted in his seat a bit before asking tentatively “you could sit with me again tomorrow If you wanted?”  “I’ve already got a spot where I spend lunch hour usually. Not in here.” Dean replied casually making Cas wilt a little then; “but you can join me if you want. Meet me by the gym tomorrow at the start of lunch okay?”  Cas brightened again nodding. “Okay.”  “Cool.” Dean stood up and brushed the nonexistent dust off himself with a grin “then I’ll see you tomorrow Cas.”  Cas smiled back. “Mm see you tomorrow.”  He didn’t know where Dean was going but he was off to calculus class—assuming he could find it.  – –  “Hey New Kid.”  Cas was really getting tired of being called that but at least this time there had been no malice behind it. More curiosity if anything. He was seated in calculus having found it with (relative) ease trying to keep his head down and out of trouble when the voice spoke up from in front of him. He reluctantly lifted his head.  The girl in the seat in front of him was twisted around in her chair to face him a wide smile on her face. Her hair was the reddest red that Cas thought it could possibly be. She gave him a little wave. “I’m Charlie. What’s your name?”  Cas hesitated before offering “Castiel. But just Cas is fine.”  “Wow yeah ‘Castiel’ is…”  “A lot.” Cas echoed Dean’s words from earlier in the day. He was starting to relax now that Charlie was turning out to be friendly. He sat up a little straighter. “It’s nice to meet you Charlie.”  “Nice to meet you too!” Charlie glanced around “I know most of the population of his school are jerks but calculus is a pretty safe class so you can relax a little. Oh!” She gestured to the side at another girl “this is Jody” and then to the boy sitting in the seat beside Cas “and this is Garth. They’re cool too.”  Jody had short brown hair and dark eyes and almost a maternal smile; Garth was tall and lanky kind of goofy looking but gave him a greeting grin that Cas couldn’t help smiling back to. He was definitely feeling more comfortable now in this class at least.  “I saw what happened at lunch” Charlie said pulling his attention back to her “Dean Winchester saved you which like… what was he even doing in the cafeteria? He always vanishes at lunch time. No one knows where he goes. It’s a mystery.” She wiggled her fingers a little “he must like you ‘cause he usually just keeps to himself or he has since he transferred in anyway.”  “Mn he said he was new too.”  “Yeah by a couple weeks. No one dares pick on him though he’d kick everyone’s asses.”  Cas coughed out a little laugh. “I got that impression.” Then after a slight hesitation “he said I could sit with him at lunch tomorrow. So.”  “Ooh exciting! You’ll have to tell us where he eats lunch then!” Charlie grinned at him then rolled her eyes slightly “aaaaaaall the girls have a crush on him. He’s handsome and mysterious and blah blah blah.”  “You think he’s over-rated.” Jody informed flatly though her expression was amused.  “Over-rated?” Cas questioned.  “Charlie is gay.” Garth explained. “Like so gay.”  “So gay.” Charlie agreed.  “Oh.” Cas shrugged. It didn’t bother him. “I’m not entirely straight myself.”  Charlie just grinned. “So you don’t think Dean Winchester is over-rated.”  He cleared his throat and glanced down a little. “He’s not unattractive.”  “Yeaaaah that’s what I thought.”  “I like girls too though I just… I like who I like. I don’t care about their gender.”  “That’s valid.” Charlie gave him a reassuring smile then just changed the topic entirely; “where’d you move from?”  Cas blinked. “Wichita Kansas. My Father and I move around a lot for his job… or we did. Now that I’m older I guess he trusts me to stay home alone so he’s going to start travelling instead. So I’m stuck here.”  “It’s not so bad here once you settle in” Jody reassured him.  “Yeah” Charlie nodded “and you’ve got us now so it’s not like you have no friends.”  “You just have weird friends.” Garth laughed.  Cas couldn’t help the little grin that crept across his own face. He was actually perfectly okay with having weird friends.  – –  In history class after calculus somebody tripped him on his way to his seat and Cas fell flat on his face. The rest of the students laughed. Cas just got back up and continued on pretending nothing had happened. That was the best way to deal with bullies he had learned over his long and sordid history of transferring from school to school. Ignore them until they give up and go away.  Or alternatively have Dean Winchester throw a basketball at their face. That apparently worked too.  In any case after the incident in history the rest of the day passed easily enough until Cas found himself standing outside the school after final bell just taking deep breaths of the fresh air and looking up at the sky—soaking in the fact that he was free at least for the rest of the day.  “You going left or right?”  Cas blinked at the familiar voice and turned his attention to Dean who had come up beside him while he was distracted with the general out-of-doors. He glanced toward the route he had to take to get home. “Right. Why?”  “Me too. I’ll walk with you.”  “Oh. Okay.” And then “thanks.”  “Don’t gotta thank me. I’m walking that way anyway.” Dean nudged him to get him moving and Cas headed off with the other boy by his side.  “No I mean” Cas waved one hand in an absent sort of gesture “I mean for earlier. In the cafeteria. You really didn’t have to do that. And one of the girls I was talking to later said you don’t even usually go in the cafeteria so I just… thanks. For going out of your way. I appreciate it.”  “You were gossiping about me?”  “I—” Cas began then clapped his mouth shut again and shook his head in a quick negative. When he spoke up once more it was to mutter “of course not.”  But Dean was already grinning looking overly amused. “It’s fine Cas I’m used to being gossip fodder. What was she saying about me?”  “That all the girls here think you’re handsome.” Cas told him easily but conveniently left out the part where he agreed with them. There was no sense in telling a guy he’d just met that he was already developing a crush on him especially when he might be moving again any day. He really wasn’t sure he trusted his father’s promises that they were going to stay put this time. “And that no one knows where you disappear to at lunch time apparently it’s a big mystery.”  Dean laughed. “Well you’ll know starting tomorrow.” He pointed out “you’re still gonna join me right?”  Cas actually gave him a surprised look. “I didn’t think you actually—”  “—meant it?” Dean finished for him. His smile softened for just a second before returning to his previous jovial expression. “Mmm… I wouldn’t have offered if I didn’t mean it. And besides you’re different from all those other assholes I can tell.”  “I like to think I am anyway.” Then “you are too.”  Dean grinned again. “I think we’re going to be friends Cas I really do.”  Cas offered up a smile of his own “I’d like that Dean.”  They walked together for a few blocks until they got to James Street at which point Cas paused and gestured down it. This was his turn off he had to walk down James to get to King Street where he lived and it was… well the term “sketchy” came to mind. James Street was all run-down houses broken fences guard dogs and probably drug dealers. Dean looked down the street giving it a thorough eyeballing before declaring—  “Nope!” He gave Cas a little push toward the street but then followed him falling into step beside him as they headed down James. “No way are you walking down here by yourself dude that’s just asking to get axe-murdered. Or worse.”  “Worse than axe-murdered?”  “Oh trust me there are so many worse things than being axe-murdered.”  Cas would have to take his word for it. He couldn’t personally think of any but that didn’t mean they didn’t exist. For now he was just going over and over in his head how this guy he had just met was walking him all the way home through a dodgy part of town even though he didn’t have to. His tiny newborn crush on Dean Winchester was probably growing teeth already and it hadn’t even been a day.  “When’s your birthday?”  “Huh?” Cas blinked back to reality at the question and actually had to fumble for a response before managing “July.”  “January.” Dean was paying very close attention to their surroundings while also trying to maintain a conversation and that was obvious. “So I’m older.”  “Only by six months.” Cas pointed out.  “Still counts. Means you have to do what I say.” Dean grinned at him fleetingly “those’re the rules!”  “I don’t like those rules.” The younger teen gave a token protest. “I think you made those rules up.”  “Possibly but they’re important.”  “Why?”  “Could save your life one day.”  Cas laughed softly at that but Dean didn’t instead falling silent until they were past James Street and out of the sketchy area that Cas had very much walked through unescorted on his way to school that morning. Dean relaxed visibly as soon as they were back to “normal” neighborhoods his steps easier and his shoulder slouching a little where they had been tense and taut only a moment before.  Honestly Cas wasn’t entirely sure what was up with Dean but clearly something was going on inside his head. He would love to have picked Dean’s brain about it but he really didn’t think Dean would be up for sharing. Maybe he had an incident in his past something to do with a neighborhood like James that had him acting like he was now. Cas thought possibly once they got to know each other a little bit more he might ask but for now…  “I live on King.” He gestured down the street in question when they neared it “I really can walk from here I… um. But thanks. Again.”  Dean’s steps slowed to a stop and he glanced around as if checking the surrounding neighborhood before deeming it safe. “Okay Cas. I’ll see you tomorrow right? Be careful walking that way on your way to school in the morning.”  “I will.” Cas gave him a little smile “thanks Dean. See you tomorrow.” Then he turned and headed across the street to King where his father was likely waiting to hear a rundown of his day.  – –  Lunch time the next day found Cas nervously waiting outside the gym half expecting Dean not to show—that it had all been an elaborate prank.  Cas’s morning had gone alright though everyone seemed to be steering clear now that it had circulated that Dean Winchester was looking out for him. He wasn’t sure what exactly Dean had done to garner his reputation but whatever it was it had been effective.  “Hey.” A hand clapped into his shoulder and when Cas glanced up Dean was standing there “c’mon.”  Cas just stared at him. “You actually came.”  “Well yeah” Dean gave him an odd look then gestured for him to follow and headed into the gym. It was empty right now except for them and Cas trailed after Dean as they walked around the side of the bleachers—and Dean ducked into the back of them then dropped down and settled with his back against the wall. He waved a hand for Cas to join him.  Cas clambered in behind the bleachers as well taking a seat beside Dean and setting his backpack beside him. “This is where you spend lunch?”  “Yeah. It’s private. Quiet usually.” Dean shrugged “I don’t mind you being here though.”  Cas blinked at that not quite sure what to say. “I—thanks?”  Dean tossed him a grin. “You don’t have to thank me for everything Cas.”  But it was the polite thing to do. Cas opened his mouth—then closed it again. After a moment he just shrugged almost awkwardly and dug in his backpack for his lunch unwrapping his sandwich and beginning to eat. He was so severely unused to having friends that this was difficult for him—socializing. He didn’t really know how to do it.  “Hey what’s your family like?” Cas glanced over when Dean spoke up. The other boy had his head leaned back against the wall his hands laced over his stomach and his eyes were staring off somewhere into the middle-distance.  “My family?” Cas swallowed a bite of sandwich and resisted the urge to shrug again. “It’s just me and my Father. He adopted me when I was five but I don’t remember anything before then. It’s always just been the two of us.”  Dean smiled a little and looked at him. “I’ve got me and my Dad and my annoying little brother. But we get by okay.”  So neither of them had Moms. That was interesting. Cas took another bite of his sandwich and asked “how come you transferred here? Does your Dad move around a lot for work or something?”  “You could say that.” Dean agreed “what about you?”  “Same.” The younger teen nodded in-between bites of food “my Father is a motivational speaker and he does series of seminars all over the place. The last couple months we were in Kansas and Oregon before that. Now we’re here.” Another bite of sandwich and he continued a little muffled “he says we’re going to stay here though now that I’m old enough to stay home on my own. He says he’ll start travelling for his work instead.” A shrug “I don’t know if I believe him or not.”  “Your Dad lie to you often?”  Cas sighed. “No it’s just… I think it’s a stretch. That he’s suddenly decided all this.”  “Mm.” Dean seemed sympathetic though Cas wasn’t entirely sure why. “Sucks that it’s this school that you’d be stuck at after everything.”  “That’s what I was thinking yesterday.” Cas admitted balling up the wrap from his lunch and dropping it back in his bag. Then he hesitated before offering “but then I met you and… things got better.”  Dean grinned again. “Yeah. I think we’re gonna be good friends Cas.”  Cas found himself smiling back—and then Dean lifted his arm to run his hand through his hair and Cas’s eyes caught on a tear in the cuff of his jacket. He tilted his head curiously. “What happened to your jacket?”  “Huh?” Dean lowered his arm to peer at the rip. He shrugged. “I don’t even know honestly half my stuff has holes in it and I never know where they came from.”  Cas was already digging through his backpack again and this time came up with a spool of black thread and a needle much to Dean’s obvious surprise. He waved one hand toward the older boy “take it off and I’ll fix it for you.”  Of all the ways this lunch hour could have gone this was not one Dean would have predicted. He looked at Cas almost blankly for a moment then let his eyes flick down to the other teen’s backpack. It was covered in vibrant patches—a cartoon PB&amp;J sandwich a pizza box an LGBTQ flag angel wings etc.—all obviously hand-sewn on. And oh. So sewing was a thing with Cas. Okay.  Dean pushed away from the wall just enough to shrug out of his jacket and handed it over watching curiously as Cas measured out a length of thread then snapped it off with his teeth threading the needle and knotting the thread a second later. He was obviously practiced at this particular skill. So was Dean but for different reasons.  A few minutes of concentration later and Cas was finished with repairing the rip in his jacket knotting off the thread and snapping it with his teeth again then tucking the needle and thread away before sheepishly handing the jacket back to Dean.  “It’s not perfect but it’s much better right?” He asked almost shyly.  Dean gave him a genuine grateful smile. “Thanks Cas. It’s great.”  Cas watched him pull his jacket back on smiling himself now. “I like to sew. It gives me something to do with my hands when I’m feeling… I don’t know. Antsy I suppose. Like some people play with pencils or fidget toys I have a needle and thread…”  Dean was inspecting the newly-sewn spot on his cuff and looked up with a grin “I play with knives.” He informed Cas only half-joking.  Cas not knowing any better laughed anyway. “Hey Dean?”  “Yeah?”  “Thanks for… being nice to me. Thanks for this. For… being my friend.”  Dean almost told him he didn’t need to thank him again. Instead he just smiled almost fond and said “you’re welcome Cas.”  – –  “What do you mean you’re not going to tell us where Dean Winchester spends lunch hour?”  This was from Charlie who had one hand clasped to her chest and a positively shocked and scandalized look on her face. The entire thing was an act and Cas knew it even having only known Charlie for two days. “Charlie.”  “What do you mean you’re not going to tell me where Dean Winchester spends lunch hour?”  “Aaaaaand there it is.” Jody drawled. Garth chuckled.  Cas just smiled apologetically. “It’s kind of a secret. I don’t think he wants people to know.”  Charlie pouted “you just want him all to yourself that’s what I think.”  Cas coughed and glanced down at the same time as Garth commented “as if you care. You couldn’t be less interested in Dean Winchester if you tried Charlie.”  “Not true!” Charlie insisted “he is indeed a mystery that I am interested in solving! Just… not in like a romantic sense. Because ew.” Then she paused before adding “I mean objectively I can see where you would find him attractive Cas but just… no thanks.”  A soft laugh from Cas faintly embarrassed. “Sorry Charlie. I’m still not going to tell you.”  The girl heaved a suffering sigh. “You disappoint me Castiel Novak.”  Again. “Sorry Charlie.”  “You are not.”  He wasn’t even a little.  – –  It became habit that Cas met Dean outside the gym every day at lunch and they spent lunch hour behind the bleachers talking and laughing and becoming better friends Cas’s minor crush on Dean growing into a huge monster of one very quickly.  Dean never had anything to eat at lunch and it hadn’t gone unnoticed by Cas though he had thus far neglected to say anything. But the longer he knew Dean and the more time he spent with the other boy the more it bothered him. He wasn’t bringing anything from home obviously and never bought anything from the cafeteria he just sat through lunch hour watching everyone else eat and going hungry himself scribbling in a battered notebook that he carried in his inside jacket pocket.  And that didn’t sit right with Cas because some days it was obvious Dean was hungry from the way he watched Cas eat out of the corner of his eye. But why he never had food was probably a sensitive subject and Cas didn’t feel he had the right to ask.  He could however do something about it.  So the next time Dean plunked himself down on the ground behind the gym bleachers at lunch time Cas sat down next to him then swung his backpack around and fished out not one but two sandwiches each individually wrapped in cling-film. He blinked at Dean and held one out. “Here.”  Dean just stared at him. “Dude what are you doing?”  “Feeding you.” Cas stated matter-of-factly and when Dean didn’t immediately take the offered sandwich he just set it in the older boy’s lap and returned to his bag digging out two apples and setting one next to Dean’s sandwich. This was followed by a pair of bottles of water. Then he shrugged. “Someone has to do it.”  “But—I—you—this is—”  Cas could sense where this was going. He headed it off at the pass. “It’s not charity if that’s what you’re worried about. It’s as easy to make two sandwiches as it is to make one.” He was already unwrapping his own sandwich and paused to glance sideways at Dean before taking a bite; “we’re friends and friends help each other out right?”  “We are yeah…” Dean continued looking at him rather oddly while he started to eat like he was having trouble with the idea of someone doing something so nice for him and not wanting anything in return. Eventually though he glanced away as if suddenly shy and carefully picked up his own sandwich unwrapping it and taking a huge bite right off the bat. He was obviously starving. Once that was chewed and swallowed he cleared his throat and offered “uh… thanks Cas.”  Cas shrugged again but gave him a smile. “As long as you don’t mind peanut butter and jelly I don’t mind sharing with you.”  “…I am not eating the apple. Apples belong in pies.”  The next day Cas started bringing him a fruit cup instead. “It’s close to pie.”  “It’s not even.”  Despite his protests Dean ate it anyway.  – –  On top of eating lunch together it had also quickly become habit for Dean to walk Cas home—mostly because he was very suspicious of James Street and that neighborhood in general and he didn’t want his only friend to be snatched up by some monster or even a common-place serial killer. A life of being a Hunter’s son had made him more than a little paranoid when it came to things like that.  Usually Cas made it outside first and just waited around by one of the retaining walls until Dean emerged from the school a few minutes later at which point they set out. Cas kept telling Dean he really didn’t need to walk him home and Dean kept doing it anyway.  Because aside from his paranoia he really did like Cas and enjoy spending time with him possibly too much really—but walking Cas home also got him away from the crappy motel and his annoying little brother for just a little while longer which was always a bonus. He was a Hunter and he had a job to do his dad drilled that into him all the damn time but he was also not-quite eighteen and needed distraction every now-and-then.  “You’re quiet.” Dean was always quiet when they were walking down James Street. Cas always tried anyway. “What are you thinking about?”  “I’m thinking it’s going to rain.”  Cas glanced up. It was severely overcast with storm clouds overhead and the humidity was through the roof. Dean was probably right. “Yeah probably.” He agreed. “Hey do you want to walk all the way to my house today? I could introduce you to my Father if he’s in. We could hang out.”  Dean flashed him a little smile. “I can’t. I’ve gotta get home to Sammy.”  ‘Sammy’ was Dean’s younger brother thirteen from what Dean had told him and attending Bedwin Junior High. Bedwin was Caspar’s affiliated Junior High so if they were around long enough Sammy—Sam—would go to Caspar as well. Dean seemed to feel that they wouldn’t be around that long though which was… disappointing. Upsetting even.  Cas was used to moving around himself and in the beginning he had been young and hadn’t known better he had made friends wherever he went and then inevitably had to leave them behind. When he got a little older he started purposefully avoiding making friends so he wouldn’t have to deal with the pain of losing them.  Now at Caspar he had dropped his guard again and even if his father kept his word and they didn’t move again and he was able to stay friends with Charlie Jody and Garth Dean… he and his brother were in the same boat as Cas had been in previously. So Cas had gotten to be friends with Dean without even meaning to gotten close to him developed a huge crush on him—though he never let it show—and Dean could be leaving any day. It was only a matter of time really.  Cas had thought that he had hardened himself to the reality of losing friends considering how he’d grown up but the thought of Dean taking off just… put a lump in the pit of his stomach. He really had it bad for the older boy had since Day One probably Charlie was right about that much.  But Dean was funny and smart and so attractive so of course—  Something heavy slammed into Cas’s back right at that moment the blow cushioned only by the fact that he was wearing his backpack and Cas yelped out a startled noise even as he tumbled to the ground landing roughly on the hard pavement.  Whatever had crashed into him was still on top of him—a person he thought—and scrabbling at him one hand holding him down by the chest while the other grabbed at his hair and shoved his head to the side. Then they lunged forward and bit into his neck—Cas gave a sharp cry—and abruptly Dean’s voice shouted something unintelligible and he yanked the person off flinging them away.  When Cas looked up the person who had attacked him was standing a few feet away wiping at his mouth and spitting. Dean was between him and Cas and had a huge buck knife in one hand (where had that come from?) holding it at the ready. When the stranger stopped gagging and lunged toward Dean Dean braced himself and full-body tackled the man knife flashing—first silver and then red—as he stabbed it into the man over and over again.  After that onslaught though and despite being stabbed several times the stranger wrenched himself away and took off fleeing into the oncoming storm.  Dean stood where he was for a moment heaving before wiping the knife on his jeans and tucking it into the back of his waistband where Cas assumed it had come from to begin with. Then he hurried back over to Cas and crouched down hands hovering uselessly. “Shit Cas are you okay?”  Cas brought one hand up to the side of his neck where he had been bitten wiping there before dropping it again to look almost blankly at the blood on his palm. That was about when it started to rain. Dean reached to help him up and together they got Cas back to his feet. He actually didn’t feel too bad all things considered.  Dean was already checking out his neck ignoring the fact that rain was pouring down on them now. “It doesn’t look too bad. It didn’t get you too deep. Could’ve ripped your throat out you’re lucky.”  “It—what—he bit me—and—you stabbed him and he didn’t even—&quot;  “Cas” Dean looked him in the eye deadly serious and told him firmly “that was a vampire.”,2024-07-12 16:50:19 GMT

Why did the ghostfacers have their break up in the boy’s room? Why were they dressed like early era Sam and Dean? And the killers said why they killed the girl but she was like 17 and homey was like 25? So like yeah she wouldn’t have a drink with him she was underage. And why kill the sheriff without thinman?

People reappearing only dead and drained of all their bodily fluids. Cocoons. It’s up to Dean to figure out what’s stalking Caspar’s halls and deal with it accordingly; but then he meets the New Kid—newer than him even the New-New Kid—Castiel Novak and all his plans get severely derailed. Now Dean has to juggle the supernatural case—a really hungry jorogumo—and also the fact that he’s very quickly falling in love something that is absolutely forbidden by his dad.  Meanwhile Castiel shoved into the third new school in a year because his adoptive father—Chuck Shurley’s—job has them moving around a lot struggles to fit in at Caspar High not only because he’s the New Kid but because he’s the weird New Kid. Dean seems like a saving grace a harbor in a storm someone who doesn’t judge him—that is until Cas finds out about Dean’s night job. Cas’s life just got a whole lot stranger—but that doesn’t stop him from falling for Dean regardless.  Notes: This is my first time writing Destiel OR SPN (though I have written SPN AU in other fandoms) so please bear with me while I get my footing.  Also HH was originally supposed to be like a 10-page one-shot and the next thing I knew it was 79-pages-of-11-pt-Arial-and-counting and I was looking for places to divide it for chapters so. Yeah. This storyline kind of just took over my brain and became a THING.  Top Dean and Bottom Cas which I know is the reverse of how 90% of the fandom writes them but I am tentatively planning a sequel to HH (depending on how well it does or doesn’t go over) that will flip them around so be patient shhhh.  Cas is younger than Dean in this AU by like… six months. Dean’s official birthday is January 24th and I used Jimmy Novak’s birthday for Cas which is July 10th. Since they’re both in the same grade that makes Cas younger. Just accept it and move on.  I have never been to Jacksonville or Florida so everything contained within this fic is completely fictitious; business names street names school names place names everything except Jacksonville Florida itself. :D  ALSO before anyone corrects me on stuff I am CANADIAN and I know the CANADIAN high school system/curriculum. I really have very little idea of how the US school system/classes work so like. I’m just making it up as I go. :D;; (Literally how many classes do US high school students have in a day?? Up here it’s FOUR.)  Please excuse my interpretation of jorogumos I took a LOT of liberties.  Chapter Two will be posted next Friday if you’re into that sort of thing. You can also read this HERE on AO3.  HORROR HIGH TUMBLR MASTER POST HERE.  HORROR HIGH Chapter One By Senashenta  Dean Winchester crept up the steps of Caspar High School in Jacksonville Florida and ducked under the line of police tape that marked off the area heading for the little tent that had been erected just to the side of the building near the bushes. The whole scene was theoretically being guarded by the police—but the officer they had left behind was asleep in his police car out front.  Bang up job Jacksonville P.D.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; That aside Dean was good at his job so sneaking into a crime scene was no big deal for him guarded or not. And this was just your basic body check there wouldn’t be any fighting or anything to wake the cop up—or that was the theory anyway. (Even if there was it wouldn’t be his first time being caught and or arrested either but they would probably just chalk it up to him being a nosy kid regardless.)  This was the first time his Dad had trusted him enough to drop him in a town to take care of a case alone. Of course Sam was in Jacksonville with Dean while their Dad headed to Utah to look into a recent spate of killings there but Sam was pretty much confined to school and the motel on this outing as per their father’s orders. Still Dean was going to be keeping a close eye on him: Sam had been known to rabbit in the past and he didn’t want to have to call his Dad and explain that he had lost his little brother (again.)  Now Dean stealthily unzipped the tent flap and stepped inside letting it fall closed behind himself.  What he was confronted with when his eyes adjusted to the darkness wasn’t a body so much as a cocoon an oblong rounded object the size of a person and wrapped in layers and layers of what looked almost like off-white cheesecloth or gauze. Dean leaned down and tapped at it with his fingers. It was soft like silk.  Well that would explain why the police hadn’t taken the body away yet; there was no body per se.  “Let’s see what’s inside you.”  Dean pulled the buck knife out of the back of his jeans unsheathed it and got to work cutting the cocoon open. The wrapping though soft was tough and sticky hard to slice through but eventually he hacked a seam lengthways along the cocoon at which point he set his knife aside to pull the damned thing open.  Inside was the actual body; male probably and curled in on itself shrivelled and desiccated and dried to a withered husk. At least it didn’t smell. Dean still made a face even as he released the cocoon and picked up his knife tucking it away again before exiting the little tent and heading off down the street making for the motel he and Sam were staying at.  The Seafoam Motel wasn’t exactly high-class but then none of the places they stayed at ever were. But it had walls and a roof good locks on the door it was cheap and nobody asked too many questions about the occupants of the rooms and those were all the important things. The Seafoam Motel ticked all the boxes for a financially strapped Hunter—and for his kids too. Not that you would know it from Sam’s complaining.  At least it had wifi the kid would have pitched an absolute fit if it hadn’t.  When he got back to the room the door was predictably locked (good job Sammy) and Dean banged on it a couple of times calling out “Sammy it’s me open the door!”  After a moment of silence there was the sound of the chain lock and deadbolt being unlocked and then the door was yanked open. Sam stepped aside to let Dean in and then closed and locked the door behind him just like it had been drilled into him so many times in the past. “What’d you find?”  “Cocoon.”  “Come again?”  “Cocoon.” Dean repeated as he crossed the room pulling his knife out and setting it on the little kitchenette table then dropping into one of the rickety chairs. “You know like the movie? The body was inside it. Wrapped up in this tough sticky… I don’t know what. But it sure looked a hell of a lot like a cocoon to me.”  Sam was already heading for his laptop. “That gives us a place to start at least.”  “Oh no no no.” Dean headed him off at the pass practically diving over and snatching the computer before Sam could get to it. “You’re not doing research all night we have freaking school in the morning.” And then “…I can’t believe I just said that.”  “Yeah because you care about school.” Sam rolled his eyes and made a grab for the laptop but Dean held it over his head where he couldn’t reach. “Dean.”  “I care about the girls at school.” He informed his brother with a grin then added “and it’s nearly two a.m. we’re going to bed. Research tomorrow. Sleep now. Besides I have to check out the school some more anyway just a cocoon isn’t going to give us much.”  Sam grumbled eventually agreed but still held his hand out for his computer. Dean deposited the laptop safely into his grasp and then started stripping down falling into bed once he was in just his boxers and a t-shirt. “Get the lights Sammy.”  Sam flicked the lights off with a long-suffering sigh.  – –  Castiel Novak wasn’t having a great first day at Caspar High. He was relatively used to being the New Kid his father’s job had them moving around a lot so he switched schools on a regular basis but the hazing at Caspar was particularly mean spirited he was finding not to mention the building itself was an absolute maze and he had been late for literally all of his morning classes simply because he hadn’t been able to find them and no one had been willing to help him out.  Now he was seated in the cafeteria by himself but surrounded by the rest of the bustling student body unsure what to really do with himself.  This wasn’t his first time being the New Kid. He and his father moved around a lot for his father’s job and Caspar High was the third school he’d transferred to since September. It was now January. His father promised that the moving would slow down though; he could see how much it wore on Cas even if the boy never said anything about it. He was going to start travelling for his seminars instead now that he felt Cas was old enough to stay home on his own. So Cas could potentially be at Caspar for a while.  He probably should have been worried about making friends. For most kids his age that would have been top priority but Cas had always been a little different and he thought he was fine on his own if it came down to it especially considering the first impression he was getting of the other students so far. It figured that the High School he was likely to actually graduate from would turn out to be full of nothing but jerks.  He was also possibly a little jaded from all the moving around he’d done in the past.  For the time being he just dug his lunch—a peanut butter and jelly sandwich an apple and a bottle of water—out of his backpack unwrapped the sandwich and began to pick little pieces of it off and eat them rather than taking proper bites as he usually would. He wasn’t really all that hungry considering there were at least a hundred pairs of eyes on him at the moment.  And then—  “HEY NEW KID!”  When Cas looked up a basketball was flying at his face and he had no time to duck out of the way—but at the last possible second hands shot out of nowhere snatching the ball out of the air before it could hit its’ target. Blue eyes blinked and his head swivelled sideways to take in the stranger that had just saved him from a black eye at the very least.  The guy wasn’t overly tall—probably around Cas’s height give or take—with short tousled brown hair. He was sporting a t-shirt and a flannel button-up under a worn black jean jacket. He was also wearing ripped jeans. But Cas was most taken by his eyes which were a sharp beautiful forest green. As he watched the other boy eyed the kid across the cafeteria who had thrown the ball to begin with—then abruptly pitched it back at the offender. The ball slammed into the other kid’s head sending him flying backward out of his seat and causing laugher to erupt all across the cafeteria.  Then his rescuer just looked down at him for a moment before dropping down to sit next to him straddling the bench. “They tried that on me my first day here too. Same thing happened then. You’d think they’d learn.”  “Thank you.” Cas offered with a blink.  “No problem.”  “I’m Castiel.”  “That’s a mouthful. I’m Dean.” And then “the fact that you’re wearing a tie right now isn’t going to help your popularity. Also” he reached over to physically pull the tie off Cas’s neck and dropped it on the table in front of them. Cas allowed it somewhat baffled. “You had it on backwards. Honestly dude just wear t-shirts like the rest of us.”  “I can do that.” Cas agreed. He owned t-shirts. He grabbed his tie to stuff it into his backpack. Then he returned to looking at Dean taking in his features and mannerisms. He was exceedingly good-looking Cas decided almost absently. At the same time Dean was looking him over as well seeming to take stock of him gaze alert and analytical. Scrutinizing.  Eventually Cas shifted a little and asked “are you new too?”  “New-ish.” Dean shrugged “I transferred in two weeks ago.”  “That’s why you’re nicer than…” Cas trailed off and glanced around the cafeteria.  “Literally everyone else here?” Dean suggested with a laugh.  “I didn’t want to say it but yes.”  “It gets better. After a few days they forget. They’re dumb like that the masses.”  “Zombies.”  “Uh” Dean hesitated but then allowed “yeah sure kind of.”  “You don’t sound very certain Dean.”  “Well Cas I just think zombies are probably different than in the movies.”  Wait. “Cas?” He called himself ‘Cas’ in his head but no one ever called him that out loud except his father.  Dean gave him a little amused look “’Castiel’ is a lot.”  “Oh. Okay.”  “As long as it’s fine with you that is.”  Cas nodded and offered a smile. “It’s fine with me.”  Dean gave him a little grin back. “Great.”  The rest of lunch hour was spent with Cas actually eating his lunch properly while he talked with Dean and they got to know each other a little. No one else bothered them for the rest of the time they were in the cafeteria and Cas was hoping he would have at least one of his afternoon classes with Dean but when they compared their schedules it sadly wasn’t to be. Cas resigned himself to hazing throughout the day for at least the next week or so—until the rest of the student body moved on.  It was a novelty to talk with someone who overlooked his innate strangeness. Cas was so used to people giving him odd looks that Dean chatting with him as freely as he was now was… almost baffling. Dean seemed like the kind of guy who could be popular have tons of friends easily and instead here he was wasting his time with Cas. It was… weird. Not that Cas was complaining.  When the bell rang to signify the end of lunch hour Cas was mildly disappointed that their conversation had to end. He shifted in his seat a bit before asking tentatively “you could sit with me again tomorrow If you wanted?”  “I’ve already got a spot where I spend lunch hour usually. Not in here.” Dean replied casually making Cas wilt a little then; “but you can join me if you want. Meet me by the gym tomorrow at the start of lunch okay?”  Cas brightened again nodding. “Okay.”  “Cool.” Dean stood up and brushed the nonexistent dust off himself with a grin “then I’ll see you tomorrow Cas.”  Cas smiled back. “Mm see you tomorrow.”  He didn’t know where Dean was going but he was off to calculus class—assuming he could find it.  – –  “Hey New Kid.”  Cas was really getting tired of being called that but at least this time there had been no malice behind it. More curiosity if anything. He was seated in calculus having found it with (relative) ease trying to keep his head down and out of trouble when the voice spoke up from in front of him. He reluctantly lifted his head.  The girl in the seat in front of him was twisted around in her chair to face him a wide smile on her face. Her hair was the reddest red that Cas thought it could possibly be. She gave him a little wave. “I’m Charlie. What’s your name?”  Cas hesitated before offering “Castiel. But just Cas is fine.”  “Wow yeah ‘Castiel’ is…”  “A lot.” Cas echoed Dean’s words from earlier in the day. He was starting to relax now that Charlie was turning out to be friendly. He sat up a little straighter. “It’s nice to meet you Charlie.”  “Nice to meet you too!” Charlie glanced around “I know most of the population of his school are jerks but calculus is a pretty safe class so you can relax a little. Oh!” She gestured to the side at another girl “this is Jody” and then to the boy sitting in the seat beside Cas “and this is Garth. They’re cool too.”  Jody had short brown hair and dark eyes and almost a maternal smile; Garth was tall and lanky kind of goofy looking but gave him a greeting grin that Cas couldn’t help smiling back to. He was definitely feeling more comfortable now in this class at least.  “I saw what happened at lunch” Charlie said pulling his attention back to her “Dean Winchester saved you which like… what was he even doing in the cafeteria? He always vanishes at lunch time. No one knows where he goes. It’s a mystery.” She wiggled her fingers a little “he must like you ‘cause he usually just keeps to himself or he has since he transferred in anyway.”  “Mn he said he was new too.”  “Yeah by a couple weeks. No one dares pick on him though he’d kick everyone’s asses.”  Cas coughed out a little laugh. “I got that impression.” Then after a slight hesitation “he said I could sit with him at lunch tomorrow. So.”  “Ooh exciting! You’ll have to tell us where he eats lunch then!” Charlie grinned at him then rolled her eyes slightly “aaaaaaall the girls have a crush on him. He’s handsome and mysterious and blah blah blah.”  “You think he’s over-rated.” Jody informed flatly though her expression was amused.  “Over-rated?” Cas questioned.  “Charlie is gay.” Garth explained. “Like so gay.”  “So gay.” Charlie agreed.  “Oh.” Cas shrugged. It didn’t bother him. “I’m not entirely straight myself.”  Charlie just grinned. “So you don’t think Dean Winchester is over-rated.”  He cleared his throat and glanced down a little. “He’s not unattractive.”  “Yeaaaah that’s what I thought.”  “I like girls too though I just… I like who I like. I don’t care about their gender.”  “That’s valid.” Charlie gave him a reassuring smile then just changed the topic entirely; “where’d you move from?”  Cas blinked. “Wichita Kansas. My Father and I move around a lot for his job… or we did. Now that I’m older I guess he trusts me to stay home alone so he’s going to start travelling instead. So I’m stuck here.”  “It’s not so bad here once you settle in” Jody reassured him.  “Yeah” Charlie nodded “and you’ve got us now so it’s not like you have no friends.”  “You just have weird friends.” Garth laughed.  Cas couldn’t help the little grin that crept across his own face. He was actually perfectly okay with having weird friends.  – –  In history class after calculus somebody tripped him on his way to his seat and Cas fell flat on his face. The rest of the students laughed. Cas just got back up and continued on pretending nothing had happened. That was the best way to deal with bullies he had learned over his long and sordid history of transferring from school to school. Ignore them until they give up and go away.  Or alternatively have Dean Winchester throw a basketball at their face. That apparently worked too.  In any case after the incident in history the rest of the day passed easily enough until Cas found himself standing outside the school after final bell just taking deep breaths of the fresh air and looking up at the sky—soaking in the fact that he was free at least for the rest of the day.  “You going left or right?”  Cas blinked at the familiar voice and turned his attention to Dean who had come up beside him while he was distracted with the general out-of-doors. He glanced toward the route he had to take to get home. “Right. Why?”  “Me too. I’ll walk with you.”  “Oh. Okay.” And then “thanks.”  “Don’t gotta thank me. I’m walking that way anyway.” Dean nudged him to get him moving and Cas headed off with the other boy by his side.  “No I mean” Cas waved one hand in an absent sort of gesture “I mean for earlier. In the cafeteria. You really didn’t have to do that. And one of the girls I was talking to later said you don’t even usually go in the cafeteria so I just… thanks. For going out of your way. I appreciate it.”  “You were gossiping about me?”  “I—” Cas began then clapped his mouth shut again and shook his head in a quick negative. When he spoke up once more it was to mutter “of course not.”  But Dean was already grinning looking overly amused. “It’s fine Cas I’m used to being gossip fodder. What was she saying about me?”  “That all the girls here think you’re handsome.” Cas told him easily but conveniently left out the part where he agreed with them. There was no sense in telling a guy he’d just met that he was already developing a crush on him especially when he might be moving again any day. He really wasn’t sure he trusted his father’s promises that they were going to stay put this time. “And that no one knows where you disappear to at lunch time apparently it’s a big mystery.”  Dean laughed. “Well you’ll know starting tomorrow.” He pointed out “you’re still gonna join me right?”  Cas actually gave him a surprised look. “I didn’t think you actually—”  “—meant it?” Dean finished for him. His smile softened for just a second before returning to his previous jovial expression. “Mmm… I wouldn’t have offered if I didn’t mean it. And besides you’re different from all those other assholes I can tell.”  “I like to think I am anyway.” Then “you are too.”  Dean grinned again. “I think we’re going to be friends Cas I really do.”  Cas offered up a smile of his own “I’d like that Dean.”  They walked together for a few blocks until they got to James Street at which point Cas paused and gestured down it. This was his turn off he had to walk down James to get to King Street where he lived and it was… well the term “sketchy” came to mind. James Street was all run-down houses broken fences guard dogs and probably drug dealers. Dean looked down the street giving it a thorough eyeballing before declaring—  “Nope!” He gave Cas a little push toward the street but then followed him falling into step beside him as they headed down James. “No way are you walking down here by yourself dude that’s just asking to get axe-murdered. Or worse.”  “Worse than axe-murdered?”  “Oh trust me there are so many worse things than being axe-murdered.”  Cas would have to take his word for it. He couldn’t personally think of any but that didn’t mean they didn’t exist. For now he was just going over and over in his head how this guy he had just met was walking him all the way home through a dodgy part of town even though he didn’t have to. His tiny newborn crush on Dean Winchester was probably growing teeth already and it hadn’t even been a day.  “When’s your birthday?”  “Huh?” Cas blinked back to reality at the question and actually had to fumble for a response before managing “July.”  “January.” Dean was paying very close attention to their surroundings while also trying to maintain a conversation and that was obvious. “So I’m older.”  “Only by six months.” Cas pointed out.  “Still counts. Means you have to do what I say.” Dean grinned at him fleetingly “those’re the rules!”  “I don’t like those rules.” The younger teen gave a token protest. “I think you made those rules up.”  “Possibly but they’re important.”  “Why?”  “Could save your life one day.”  Cas laughed softly at that but Dean didn’t instead falling silent until they were past James Street and out of the sketchy area that Cas had very much walked through unescorted on his way to school that morning. Dean relaxed visibly as soon as they were back to “normal” neighborhoods his steps easier and his shoulder slouching a little where they had been tense and taut only a moment before.  Honestly Cas wasn’t entirely sure what was up with Dean but clearly something was going on inside his head. He would love to have picked Dean’s brain about it but he really didn’t think Dean would be up for sharing. Maybe he had an incident in his past something to do with a neighborhood like James that had him acting like he was now. Cas thought possibly once they got to know each other a little bit more he might ask but for now…  “I live on King.” He gestured down the street in question when they neared it “I really can walk from here I… um. But thanks. Again.”  Dean’s steps slowed to a stop and he glanced around as if checking the surrounding neighborhood before deeming it safe. “Okay Cas. I’ll see you tomorrow right? Be careful walking that way on your way to school in the morning.”  “I will.” Cas gave him a little smile “thanks Dean. See you tomorrow.” Then he turned and headed across the street to King where his father was likely waiting to hear a rundown of his day.  – –  Lunch time the next day found Cas nervously waiting outside the gym half expecting Dean not to show—that it had all been an elaborate prank.  Cas’s morning had gone alright though everyone seemed to be steering clear now that it had circulated that Dean Winchester was looking out for him. He wasn’t sure what exactly Dean had done to garner his reputation but whatever it was it had been effective.  “Hey.” A hand clapped into his shoulder and when Cas glanced up Dean was standing there “c’mon.”  Cas just stared at him. “You actually came.”  “Well yeah” Dean gave him an odd look then gestured for him to follow and headed into the gym. It was empty right now except for them and Cas trailed after Dean as they walked around the side of the bleachers—and Dean ducked into the back of them then dropped down and settled with his back against the wall. He waved a hand for Cas to join him.  Cas clambered in behind the bleachers as well taking a seat beside Dean and setting his backpack beside him. “This is where you spend lunch?”  “Yeah. It’s private. Quiet usually.” Dean shrugged “I don’t mind you being here though.”  Cas blinked at that not quite sure what to say. “I—thanks?”  Dean tossed him a grin. “You don’t have to thank me for everything Cas.”  But it was the polite thing to do. Cas opened his mouth—then closed it again. After a moment he just shrugged almost awkwardly and dug in his backpack for his lunch unwrapping his sandwich and beginning to eat. He was so severely unused to having friends that this was difficult for him—socializing. He didn’t really know how to do it.  “Hey what’s your family like?” Cas glanced over when Dean spoke up. The other boy had his head leaned back against the wall his hands laced over his stomach and his eyes were staring off somewhere into the middle-distance.  “My family?” Cas swallowed a bite of sandwich and resisted the urge to shrug again. “It’s just me and my Father. He adopted me when I was five but I don’t remember anything before then. It’s always just been the two of us.”  Dean smiled a little and looked at him. “I’ve got me and my Dad and my annoying little brother. But we get by okay.”  So neither of them had Moms. That was interesting. Cas took another bite of his sandwich and asked “how come you transferred here? Does your Dad move around a lot for work or something?”  “You could say that.” Dean agreed “what about you?”  “Same.” The younger teen nodded in-between bites of food “my Father is a motivational speaker and he does series of seminars all over the place. The last couple months we were in Kansas and Oregon before that. Now we’re here.” Another bite of sandwich and he continued a little muffled “he says we’re going to stay here though now that I’m old enough to stay home on my own. He says he’ll start travelling for his work instead.” A shrug “I don’t know if I believe him or not.”  “Your Dad lie to you often?”  Cas sighed. “No it’s just… I think it’s a stretch. That he’s suddenly decided all this.”  “Mm.” Dean seemed sympathetic though Cas wasn’t entirely sure why. “Sucks that it’s this school that you’d be stuck at after everything.”  “That’s what I was thinking yesterday.” Cas admitted balling up the wrap from his lunch and dropping it back in his bag. Then he hesitated before offering “but then I met you and… things got better.”  Dean grinned again. “Yeah. I think we’re gonna be good friends Cas.”  Cas found himself smiling back—and then Dean lifted his arm to run his hand through his hair and Cas’s eyes caught on a tear in the cuff of his jacket. He tilted his head curiously. “What happened to your jacket?”  “Huh?” Dean lowered his arm to peer at the rip. He shrugged. “I don’t even know honestly half my stuff has holes in it and I never know where they came from.”  Cas was already digging through his backpack again and this time came up with a spool of black thread and a needle much to Dean’s obvious surprise. He waved one hand toward the older boy “take it off and I’ll fix it for you.”  Of all the ways this lunch hour could have gone this was not one Dean would have predicted. He looked at Cas almost blankly for a moment then let his eyes flick down to the other teen’s backpack. It was covered in vibrant patches—a cartoon PB&amp;J sandwich a pizza box an LGBTQ flag angel wings etc.—all obviously hand-sewn on. And oh. So sewing was a thing with Cas. Okay.  Dean pushed away from the wall just enough to shrug out of his jacket and handed it over watching curiously as Cas measured out a length of thread then snapped it off with his teeth threading the needle and knotting the thread a second later. He was obviously practiced at this particular skill. So was Dean but for different reasons.  A few minutes of concentration later and Cas was finished with repairing the rip in his jacket knotting off the thread and snapping it with his teeth again then tucking the needle and thread away before sheepishly handing the jacket back to Dean.  “It’s not perfect but it’s much better right?” He asked almost shyly.  Dean gave him a genuine grateful smile. “Thanks Cas. It’s great.”  Cas watched him pull his jacket back on smiling himself now. “I like to sew. It gives me something to do with my hands when I’m feeling… I don’t know. Antsy I suppose. Like some people play with pencils or fidget toys I have a needle and thread…”  Dean was inspecting the newly-sewn spot on his cuff and looked up with a grin “I play with knives.” He informed Cas only half-joking.  Cas not knowing any better laughed anyway. “Hey Dean?”  “Yeah?”  “Thanks for… being nice to me. Thanks for this. For… being my friend.”  Dean almost told him he didn’t need to thank him again. Instead he just smiled almost fond and said “you’re welcome Cas.”  – –  “What do you mean you’re not going to tell us where Dean Winchester spends lunch hour?”  This was from Charlie who had one hand clasped to her chest and a positively shocked and scandalized look on her face. The entire thing was an act and Cas knew it even having only known Charlie for two days. “Charlie.”  “What do you mean you’re not going to tell me where Dean Winchester spends lunch hour?”  “Aaaaaand there it is.” Jody drawled. Garth chuckled.  Cas just smiled apologetically. “It’s kind of a secret. I don’t think he wants people to know.”  Charlie pouted “you just want him all to yourself that’s what I think.”  Cas coughed and glanced down at the same time as Garth commented “as if you care. You couldn’t be less interested in Dean Winchester if you tried Charlie.”  “Not true!” Charlie insisted “he is indeed a mystery that I am interested in solving! Just… not in like a romantic sense. Because ew.” Then she paused before adding “I mean objectively I can see where you would find him attractive Cas but just… no thanks.”  A soft laugh from Cas faintly embarrassed. “Sorry Charlie. I’m still not going to tell you.”  The girl heaved a suffering sigh. “You disappoint me Castiel Novak.”  Again. “Sorry Charlie.”  “You are not.”  He wasn’t even a little.  – –  It became habit that Cas met Dean outside the gym every day at lunch and they spent lunch hour behind the bleachers talking and laughing and becoming better friends Cas’s minor crush on Dean growing into a huge monster of one very quickly.  Dean never had anything to eat at lunch and it hadn’t gone unnoticed by Cas though he had thus far neglected to say anything. But the longer he knew Dean and the more time he spent with the other boy the more it bothered him. He wasn’t bringing anything from home obviously and never bought anything from the cafeteria he just sat through lunch hour watching everyone else eat and going hungry himself scribbling in a battered notebook that he carried in his inside jacket pocket.  And that didn’t sit right with Cas because some days it was obvious Dean was hungry from the way he watched Cas eat out of the corner of his eye. But why he never had food was probably a sensitive subject and Cas didn’t feel he had the right to ask.  He could however do something about it.  So the next time Dean plunked himself down on the ground behind the gym bleachers at lunch time Cas sat down next to him then swung his backpack around and fished out not one but two sandwiches each individually wrapped in cling-film. He blinked at Dean and held one out. “Here.”  Dean just stared at him. “Dude what are you doing?”  “Feeding you.” Cas stated matter-of-factly and when Dean didn’t immediately take the offered sandwich he just set it in the older boy’s lap and returned to his bag digging out two apples and setting one next to Dean’s sandwich. This was followed by a pair of bottles of water. Then he shrugged. “Someone has to do it.”  “But—I—you—this is—”  Cas could sense where this was going. He headed it off at the pass. “It’s not charity if that’s what you’re worried about. It’s as easy to make two sandwiches as it is to make one.” He was already unwrapping his own sandwich and paused to glance sideways at Dean before taking a bite; “we’re friends and friends help each other out right?”  “We are yeah…” Dean continued looking at him rather oddly while he started to eat like he was having trouble with the idea of someone doing something so nice for him and not wanting anything in return. Eventually though he glanced away as if suddenly shy and carefully picked up his own sandwich unwrapping it and taking a huge bite right off the bat. He was obviously starving. Once that was chewed and swallowed he cleared his throat and offered “uh… thanks Cas.”  Cas shrugged again but gave him a smile. “As long as you don’t mind peanut butter and jelly I don’t mind sharing with you.”  “…I am not eating the apple. Apples belong in pies.”  The next day Cas started bringing him a fruit cup instead. “It’s close to pie.”  “It’s not even.”  Despite his protests Dean ate it anyway.  – –  On top of eating lunch together it had also quickly become habit for Dean to walk Cas home—mostly because he was very suspicious of James Street and that neighborhood in general and he didn’t want his only friend to be snatched up by some monster or even a common-place serial killer. A life of being a Hunter’s son had made him more than a little paranoid when it came to things like that.  Usually Cas made it outside first and just waited around by one of the retaining walls until Dean emerged from the school a few minutes later at which point they set out. Cas kept telling Dean he really didn’t need to walk him home and Dean kept doing it anyway.  Because aside from his paranoia he really did like Cas and enjoy spending time with him possibly too much really—but walking Cas home also got him away from the crappy motel and his annoying little brother for just a little while longer which was always a bonus. He was a Hunter and he had a job to do his dad drilled that into him all the damn time but he was also not-quite eighteen and needed distraction every now-and-then.  “You’re quiet.” Dean was always quiet when they were walking down James Street. Cas always tried anyway. “What are you thinking about?”  “I’m thinking it’s going to rain.”  Cas glanced up. It was severely overcast with storm clouds overhead and the humidity was through the roof. Dean was probably right. “Yeah probably.” He agreed. “Hey do you want to walk all the way to my house today? I could introduce you to my Father if he’s in. We could hang out.”  Dean flashed him a little smile. “I can’t. I’ve gotta get home to Sammy.”  ‘Sammy’ was Dean’s younger brother thirteen from what Dean had told him and attending Bedwin Junior High. Bedwin was Caspar’s affiliated Junior High so if they were around long enough Sammy—Sam—would go to Caspar as well. Dean seemed to feel that they wouldn’t be around that long though which was… disappointing. Upsetting even.  Cas was used to moving around himself and in the beginning he had been young and hadn’t known better he had made friends wherever he went and then inevitably had to leave them behind. When he got a little older he started purposefully avoiding making friends so he wouldn’t have to deal with the pain of losing them.  Now at Caspar he had dropped his guard again and even if his father kept his word and they didn’t move again and he was able to stay friends with Charlie Jody and Garth Dean… he and his brother were in the same boat as Cas had been in previously. So Cas had gotten to be friends with Dean without even meaning to gotten close to him developed a huge crush on him—though he never let it show—and Dean could be leaving any day. It was only a matter of time really.  Cas had thought that he had hardened himself to the reality of losing friends considering how he’d grown up but the thought of Dean taking off just… put a lump in the pit of his stomach. He really had it bad for the older boy had since Day One probably Charlie was right about that much.  But Dean was funny and smart and so attractive so of course—  Something heavy slammed into Cas’s back right at that moment the blow cushioned only by the fact that he was wearing his backpack and Cas yelped out a startled noise even as he tumbled to the ground landing roughly on the hard pavement.  Whatever had crashed into him was still on top of him—a person he thought—and scrabbling at him one hand holding him down by the chest while the other grabbed at his hair and shoved his head to the side. Then they lunged forward and bit into his neck—Cas gave a sharp cry—and abruptly Dean’s voice shouted something unintelligible and he yanked the person off flinging them away.  When Cas looked up the person who had attacked him was standing a few feet away wiping at his mouth and spitting. Dean was between him and Cas and had a huge buck knife in one hand (where had that come from?) holding it at the ready. When the stranger stopped gagging and lunged toward Dean Dean braced himself and full-body tackled the man knife flashing—first silver and then red—as he stabbed it into the man over and over again.  After that onslaught though and despite being stabbed several times the stranger wrenched himself away and took off fleeing into the oncoming storm.  Dean stood where he was for a moment heaving before wiping the knife on his jeans and tucking it into the back of his waistband where Cas assumed it had come from to begin with. Then he hurried back over to Cas and crouched down hands hovering uselessly. “Shit Cas are you okay?”  Cas brought one hand up to the side of his neck where he had been bitten wiping there before dropping it again to look almost blankly at the blood on his palm. That was about when it started to rain. Dean reached to help him up and together they got Cas back to his feet. He actually didn’t feel too bad all things considered.  Dean was already checking out his neck ignoring the fact that rain was pouring down on them now. “It doesn’t look too bad. It didn’t get you too deep. Could’ve ripped your throat out you’re lucky.”  “It—what—he bit me—and—you stabbed him and he didn’t even—&quot;  “Cas” Dean looked him in the eye deadly serious and told him firmly “that was a vampire.”,2024-07-12 16:50:19 GMT

“what’s wrong sam?” i ask he sighs looking down before looking back up at me again.  “i’m sorry. for everything i did to you while i was soulless. shamelessly flirting with you. toying with your feelings. i’m really sorry.” i sigh looking into his hurt filled eyes.     &lt;!-- more --&gt; “sam it’s not your fault. you didn’t care.” i say putting my hand on his that was laying on the table.  “i do now. belle when you showed me your home and that field. i felt connected to you. those feelings. i do like you belle. i have since then. which for you was a long time but for me not so much. i just want you to know that just because i didn’t care then doesn’t mean i don’t care now.” i nod before pulling him into a hug. i pull away looking at him confused again.  “wait who told you?”  “cas.”  “ah.” he sighs getting up from the table.  “i’m gonna go talk to dean.” i nod as i watch him walk away. maybe my grandma was right. only time will tell.   bobby had brought us into the living room to his desk. he wanted to tell us about the journal we had found in the dragons lair.me bobby and dean sat in the living room of bobby’s house. bobby was on one side of the desk while me and dean sat on the other.  “sam’s still asleep?” bobby ask as he sips on his whiskey in his hand.  “yeah.” dean mumbles out as he doesn’t look at bobby.  “he’ll wake up.” i say looking at dean. he keeps his eyes away from us.  “yeah.” dean says again.  “dean he’s been through how much? somehow he always bounces back.” bobby says trying to lift dean’s spirits up a bit.  “he’s never been through this.” dean drags on as he looks down at the paper in front of bobby. “job?”  “hmm might be.” bobby says throwing the piece of paper over to dean so he could see it. dean picks it up.  “can i help? send me to the library? anything?” i look at dean as he asks this. the whole conversation that cas and him had just a few minutes ago really didn’t sit well in him. he was scared that he would lose his brother.  “couple goes up on a light plane. wreckage was found in the woods.” bobby explains.  “couple of buddy hollys doesn’t really seem like ‘news of the weird.’” dean says handing bobby back the paper as he leaned back in his seat. bobby hands be the paper before explaining more.  “pilot was found seventeen miles away flambéed. girl’s just gone. no body no nothing.” hm that’s interesting.  “okay i’m not changing the channel.”  “dean.” we hear from behind us. me and dean turn around quickly to see sam standing there. sam slowly walks into the room. looking at all of us with this still look on his face.  “sam?” dean says as he stands up. sam rushes over to dean giving him a big hug. me and bobby stand up bobby makes his way around the table.  after sam hugs dean he notices me and bobby. sam hugs me his arms around my waist and mine around his neck. he holds me for a second i can feel his breathe hitting my neck. he pulls away from me giving me a slight smile before he made his way to bobby.  they embrace for a second. “good to see you.” bobby says as sam pulls back.  “wait. i saw you- i felt lucifer snap your neck.” sam says looking at him confused. dean look at me for a second with a &#x27;he doesn’t remember’ look.  “well cas kind of-” bobby was cut off my sam.  “cas is alive?” sam says as he lets out a heavy breathe of relief.  “yeah cas is fine. sam are you okay?” dean says as he walks closer to him. sam smiles a little before waiting a second to reply.  “actually umm.. i’m starving.” we all look at each other before i go to the kitchen and make sam a sandwich. he sits at the table and starts to eat me and dean sit with him at the table.  “so sam.” dean starts off.  “yeah?”  “what’s the last thing you remember?” dean asks as sam thinks for a second.  “the field and then i fell.” sam says as he glances at all of us before returning his attention to dean.  “okay and then?” dean tries to pry more.  “um i woke up in the panic room.” death’s barrier he put on sam’s soul must have worked.  “that’s it?” bobby questions. “you really don’t remember-?”  “let’s be glad.” dean says cutting off bobby giving him a look. “who want to remember all that hell?”  “well how long was i gone?” sam asks looking to me and bobby.  “about a year and a half.” i say looking at sam with hurt in my eyes.  “what?” he glances back to dean. “i was downstairs-? i don’t remember anything. so how’d i get back? was it cas? or did you find a way using magic?” he says looking to me questionably.  “not exactly.” dean says making sam look at him while he just looked down at the table.  “dean what did you do?” i look away not exactly wanting to be here for this part of the conversation.  “me and death-” dean says looking up at sam which he was soon cut off.  “death? the horsemen?” sam asks raising his voice.  “i had leverage. it’s done.”  “you sure?”  “it’s over. slate’s wiped.”  “well isn’t this just neat and clean?” i was glad that bobby said something. i would normally but dean was still mad at me he was just hiding it mostly.  “yes it is for once.” dean and bobby share a look making the room silent for a minute.  “is there anything else i should know?” sam asks looking to dean for an answer.  “no.” dean says shaking his head. i try to keep a happy look on my face for sam’s sake. “another beer?” dean asks him motioning to the bottle.  “uh yeah.” dean gets up and heads over to the fridge.  after a while bobby had gone outside and dean went to go check on him which left me and sam alone. me and sam sat on the couch as we started to talk.  “so how have you been the last year and a half. you haven’t really said anything.” sam says taking a sip of his beer. i half expected him to put his hand on my leg like he had been doing before but then i remember that that was sam without a soul.  “um nothing super. dean met my family.” i laugh a little looking down at my hands. “my dad thinks he has a thing for me but he thinks that every guy that comes by our house does. on a sadder note my grandma died a couple of weeks ago.” i look back up to sam to see him with a sad look on his face.  “i’m really sorry belle.” he says putting his hand on mine which was on my lap still.  “it’s fine she was a great woman. i miss her but i got some of her journal’s so did my brother. they are pretty interesting. some are about her witchcraft and others are just about life events like when me my dad and my brother were born. or when my dad got married even when she got married.” he smiles at me as he sees my face glow when i talk about it.  “that’s great. have you started reading any yet?” he asks keeping his hand still on mine.  “some my brother and me read this one about when i was born. she mentioned how she thought i might be the natural witch. i guess she was right. my dad said that she always was.” i say look in his eyes. he was very interested.  “i would love to read some of those if you’d let me.” he says kind of not sure if he should ask or not.  “yeah i’m sure she wouldn’t have minded. she told me to stick with you guys before she died. i guess she knew that my future lied with you both.” he laughs a little.  “belle i want you to know that i’m always going to be there for you. i kind of figured out that you and dean aren’t in a good place. just the way he was acting.” i sigh looking away.  “yeah he’s kind of mad at me for something stupid. he’ll get over it. you know how dean is stubborn.” we both laugh.   me dean and bobby are outside packing up the car. bobby and dean were going to go check out a hunt that they talked about earlier. i was planning to stay here with sam. dean closes the truck of the car as we finish putting everything in.  “sam still asleep?” bobby questions as he opens the door to the impala to put his bag in the front.  “yeah let him rest. we’ll call him later.” dean says before we hear sam from behind us.  “call me from where?” sam asks as we all turn around to face him.  “oh. uh there’s this thing in oregon.” dean starts to explain but sam cuts him off before he can finish.  “great. i’m in.”  “whoa whoa you just got vertical.”  “exactly. i’m up. i’m good.”  “a few more days of cable couldn’t hurt you.” dean trys to protest.  “right because that’s what you did when you got back from hell.” dean didn’t try to argue with him.  “all right. you me and bobby. and belle if you want to come.” i nod at him.  “oh you three go on ahead. you got this covered. i uh forgot i promised that idjit rufus i’d work the phones for him so…” bobby says as he brings his bag from the car with him.  “you sure?” i ask bobby.  “yeah yeah yeah. you three enjoy catching up okay?” he says before walking away. we all turn and look at him for a second.  “what was that?” sam asks turning to dean.  “one part age three parts liquor.” dean says before making his way to the car.   i slept most of the way there being super tired still from the drive to sioux falls two days before. we got to portland not to long and we started to work the case. we went to the sister of the recent victims house to ask her some questions.  “you’re uh penny dessertine’s sister right?” dean asks after we show her our badges. she nods at us.  “uh we’d just like to ask you a few questions.” sam says with his normal nice voice.  “look the cops already came by. i’m tired. so if you don’t mind.” she says looking at us hoping that we would just go away.  “i understand. really i do. i know how hard this must be. we’d just like to figure out what happened. this will be quick i promise.” sam always did have a way with words.  “okay. fine. come in.” she says moving into the house as we all follow her dean lingering behind.  she had brought us to her room to look around. sam was looking down at a picture of penny and a guy. i stood next to him looking at the picture as well.  “penny was very shy. to herself.” me and sam look up to her sister as she talked. “not at all what you’d call adventurous.”  “not like flying through a lightning storm in a two-seater.” dean says as he stands next to the night stand near the window.  “she was terrified of that thing. she just did it for stan.”  “stan?” i say looking at her questionably.  “they were just starting to get serious. she didn’t want to seem you know not interested. i just wish i’d told her to stay home. we don’t even have a body to bury.” we all look at her sadly. sam looks back down at the picture continuing to examine it.  sam was sitting at the table in the motel room while i laid down on one of the beds reading one of my grandma’s journals. sam was researching. dean can through the door with drinks and food in his hands. sam said a quick hey before dean closed the door with his foot.  “what do you got?” dean asked making his way over to the table that sam sat at putting the food on the table.  “well looks like those other two missing girls baked cookies for the lord.” sam says as dean makes his way over to his bed which was across from sam’s which was the one i was on.  “what is that code?” dean asks turning back to sam.  “no. church choir bake sales uh promise ring clubs the works. they were good girls. but penny wasn’t even a christian so-” sam explains but is soon cut off by dean.  “i have another theory.” dean says as he pulls out a diary. “penny’s diary.”  “did you steal that from her room?” sam asks as i look up from the journal in front of me to dean.   “i love that you even ask me that.”  “and why wouldn’t i?” well sam you wouldn’t have for the last year and a half but you don’t know that.  “no reason. so girlnappings. what if it’s not about religion? what if it’s about purity?” dean pauses as him and sam share a look.  “you mean you think they’re all-?” i question thinking i’m on the same page as dean.  “virgins belle. virgins.” dean says giving me a look before sitting on the chair across from sam.  “penny was twenty two.” sam says not really believing it.  “yeah with a pink room.” dean says flipping through the pages of the diary he had in his hands.  “so?”  “and stuffed teddy bears.” i say looking at sam with a tight smile.  “fine but you really think-?” sam says while looking from me to dean. dean cuts him off by holding his finger up before reading from the diary.  “&#x27;i’ve decided i’m going to give stan my most precious gift.’” dean quotes from the girl before holding his arms out in a &#x27;i’m right’ gesture.  “wow. that sounded really creepy coming out of you mouth.” sam says looking down kind of grossed out. i nod my head getting up to stand next to dean as i read over his shoulder.  “i think i delivered it.” dean says seeming full of himself.  “you know you could have led with the diary you know?” sam says as dean continues to flip through the diary and we both skim the pages. “anyways let’s say you’re right. fine. who would want virgins?”  “some guys are into that.” i say shrugging taking a seat back on the bed.  “i prefer ladies with experience.” dean says smirking at sam as a joke. i laugh a little before going back to the journal i was reading once before.   we heard of another victim this one was left alive. we were in her room in the hospital questioning her. she was laid sideways on the bed looking up at us.  “it happened so fast.”  “it’s all right melissa. what came at you? you can tell us.” sam says looking at her with his sincere eyes.  “it-it looked like uh.. a giant bat.” sam and dean look to each other as melissa looked at them knowing what they were thinking.  “you think i’m making it up right? that’s what the other man said.” she says looking away laying back onto her pillow.  “well we aren’t the other guy.” i say as she meet my eyes. she started to open up more.  “it came right at me. it was huge. i swear. that’s how i got this.” she pulled her gown over to show us her back. she had deep cuts going down from her shoulder blade to her mid back. they had been stitched up but they still looked awful.  “so it attacked then what happened?” sam questions as the girl pulls the gown back to cover her before going back to the same position.  “i don’t know. i passed out and when i woke up it was gone.” hm why would it do that? maybe she’s not a virgin and it didn’t want her.  “anything else you can think of? anything you can tell us even if it doesn&#x27;t important?”  “well my ring got lost. or else that thing stole it if that makes any sense.”  “what kind of ring?” dean asks and melissa is quick to answer.  “gold. promise ring.”  “promise ring. so uh from like a church like a purity ring?” dean rambles with his question.  “yeah. why?”  dean cleared his throat. “i gotta ask. ahh… melissa look nobody is judging anybody here okay? believe me. but should you really be wearing that ring?” dean caught on to my thoughts to.  “well i mean i am-”  “really?” melissa and dean share a harsh look. me and sam kind of sat there awkwardly.  “matt barne didn’t count.”  soon after we leave the hospital. we were still trying to figure out what this was and what the motive was with the virgins.  “so what you think batman tried to rape her?” sam asks as we start to walk out of the hospital and to the car.  “well he does carry a lot of rage. but he rejected her because she was already dehymenated huh?” dean went on.  “you think?” i ask looking to dean as i tried to keep up with them.  “i think it just goes to show that being easy is pretty much all upside.” i roll my eyes and sam scoffs.  “so what kind of thing likes virgins and gold?” sam asks exchanging glances with me and dean. i shrugged.  “p. diddy?” dean jokes sam rolls his eyes.  “you know it’s comforting.”  “what?”  “i did for a year came back and you’re still not funny.” i laugh at sam’s joke as we get to the car opening our doors.  “shut up. i’m hilarious.” dean says as we get into the car.   when we get back to the motel i decide to take a nap while the boys do research. i wake up to find only sam. he was looking through lore.  “hey you’re awake.” he says looking over at me. “we figured it out well sort of. we think it’s a dragon.”  i sigh sitting up rubbing a face with my hand for a second before getting up and heading over to sam sitting next to him. “i thought those didn’t exist.”  “well apparently they do. and they like virgins.” i laugh a little we both stare into each other’s eyes for a second.  “so do you know where they hid out or how to kill them?” i say breaking the eye contact and looking to the laptop in front of us. i sit down on the chair next to him.  “um dean is going to see one of bobby’s friends about it and all i can find is caves.” i let out a deep sigh before leaning back in my chair. sam gets up and heads over to the wall with all the pictures of the girls and the map on it. he looks at it for a second before pulling out his phone calling someone.  “hey. um he went to go see your friend. so look i’m trying to figure out where this thing lairs up. little help maybe?” bobby. while he’s talking he come and sits back down in the chair facing me. “… caves basically. but there’s nothing around for miles…. huh.” he says getting up again going around me back over to the wall with the pictures. i turn to look with him but stay in my chair. “well um there’s no subway lines. sewers. that could be it. thanks… wait bobby. wait um. you okay?..” i look at him confused. was there something wrong with bobby?  “.. besides the way you’ve been acting and talking nothing.” sam says into the phone kind of acting like a dad talking to his attitude filled kid. “is there something i should know?” he continues walking pacing a little around the room.  “…well bobby what happened this last year?” sam asks sitting in front of me again. i give him a &#x27;what are y&#x27;all talking about?’ look and he holds up his finger to tell me to wait a second. “right. of course.” he tries to say more but bobby hanging up gets him before he can talk. he stays silent for a minute throwing his phone across the table. i get up grabbing my phone.  “hey i’m going to go get some food. you want anything?” i say and he looks up for a second.  “no thanks.” i sigh turning around the the door i pull it closed behind me before heading down the street to the diner i saw on the way in.   when dean gets back he comes in with a half broken sword that we are supposed to use to slay the dragon.  “what are we supposed to do with this dean give it a booster shot?” sam questions eyeing the sword as i stood next to him doing the same.  “it’s what we got. we just have to get closer. that’s all.” dean says as sam hands him back the broken sword. “where are we on the caves?”  “nowhere. sewers on the other hand. here check this out.” sam says as him and dean go to the map on the table i look at the journal that used to be on the bed was now on the table as well. i hope sam didn’t read it. it’s the one about when i was born. that would be awkward. “so two of the disappearances happened with in a mile of here. so i figured we start there work out way around.” pointing to a spot on the map.  “awesome. who doesn’t love sewers?” i raise my hand but they both ignore my joke. “let’s go.” dean walks over to get some supplies while i get some of my stuff as well. sam staying in the same place. “what?” dean says looking at sam confused.  “nothing. uh yeah let’s go.” he says after sighing and heading with us to the door.  we get down into the sewers and the smell is awful.  “oh God. just when i get used to a smell i hit a new favor. dude we have been here for hours. there is nothing. i think the lore is off. hey what if dragons like nice hotels?” dean rambles as we head down a set of stairs and look around the new found area we have reached. sam looks to the other side of me and dean pointing his flashlight.  “what is that?” sam says as me and dean both turn to the pile of gold trinkets sam had is flashlight on.  “holy crap.” dean says walking over to it. he bends down and picks a bracelet in his hand eyeing it. “okay. maybe there are dragons here.”  “wait. dean not right now. check this out.” i say looking down the hall we hadn’t adventured to yet noticing something strange.  we walk down to see a ledge hanging out acting as some soft of table. on it were candles lit and other trinkets placed around. a notebook was placed in the middle of it all.  “a little arts-and-crafty for a giant bat right?” sam questions as dean picks up the journal. “huh.”  “hello? is someone there? can you help us?” we heard someone yell from another room. we start to proceed toward the voice. we come to this big open room as we walk across a bridge like walkway it was metal and was scary in my opinion. “hello? over here.”  we heard the voice again but it was closer. we get to the voice to see a group of girls trapped in a metal cage similar to the bridge we had been walking on. “help us.” we bend down to look for a way to get them out.  “hey. we’re going to get you out.” dean says looking at the frightened girls.  “he’s coming back.” one of them says. sam says a quick okay and goes to open the cage but is pulled away quickly. dean stands up quickly as i do too. dean has the half broken sword at the ready.  “where do you think you’re gonna stick that?” the man that we assumed was the dragon said. dean charges and slices into his arm a little cutting him. i think that dean has it covered so i head over to sam to make sure he’s okay.  “sam.” i say trying to shake him awake it doesn’t work. i look up and notice that the dragon had knocked the half broken sword out of his hands and was now approaching him with his hand red hot. i come up behind him with a floating metal bar i had found hitting him across the head distracting him from dean so he could get the sword. sam had woken up and grabbed the metal bar that was now away from me since i did that with my powers he hit the dragon again continuing to distract him. i use my powers to hold him back so that sam could get some good hits in. before i know it sam accidentally pushes me back and the dragon is released from my grip for a second. this lets him grab the iron rod with his hot hand before sam can get another lick in.  i noticed dean getting picked up from where he was trying to get the sword by what looks like another dragon. i get close to the sword enough from me to be able to get it out from were it was. “sam!” i yell giving him the half broken weapon. at least one of us was armed. if only i could kill dragons with my magics this would be a lot easier.  sam cuts the dragon in front of him before turning and stabbing the one that was trying to attack dean. all of us staring at the dead one before turning around just in time for the other to disappear.   we get back to bobby’s i head inside trying to cool down from the hunt. i sigh sitting in the kitchen. sam comes up to me and sits down. he looks at me with a sad smile. i tilt my head a little confused.  “now as near as i can figure it this dates back around the fourteenth century.” bobby says turning to book over as he sits down in his chair. me sam and dean gather around to look at the book. sam and dean are leaned down while i am sat on the side of the desk looking over at it.  “what language is it in?” i ask wondering if maybe i could translate it. good thing about being a witch is that you have to learn multiple languages to perform spells. most of the spells are in latin so my mom taught me since i was in fourth grade which caused me to now be fluent. thanks mom.  “da vinci code.” welp i’m out. don’t know that. sam flips through the pages i look through them noticing something. i think it’s made out of human skin. ew. “real obscure latinate. gonna take me my golden years to translate it.”  sam goes over to get a chair and brings it over to sit down. “oh and uh fyi… that ain’t paper.” bobby says pointing to the book.  “what is it?” dean says with a confused look on his face.  “human skin. right bobby?” i say looking to him as he nods and we both look back to the boys to see slightly disgusted faces.  “okay. i’m fairly clear on this first bit. it basically describes this place. it’s like the backside of your worst nightmares. it’s all blood and bone and darkness. filled with the bodies and souls of all things hungry sharp and nasty.” bobby explains. i take a deep breath i think i know what he’s talking about.  “monsters?” sam questions clarifying what he was thinking.  “it’s monster land. according to this it goes by many names most of which i cant pronounce but i’m thinking you know purgatory.” my heart slightly drops. i mean there’s rumors of that place but i was hoping it was fake.  “purgatory?” dean asks looking at bobby a little weirded out. “awesome. well that is ahem good to know.” dean grabs a glass and the whiskey starting to pour himself some before he continued.  “so you’re saying that these dragon freaks were squatting in the sewers and reading tone poems about purgatory?” dean asks sitting down in the chair that was next to us.  “no dean.” i say rolling my eyes looking back at bobby. i was already picking up that this was a bigger deal.  “they’re reading an instruction manual.” bobby says making dean look at him crazy.  “what?”  “yeah. if you’re nuts enough to want access to a place that gnarly this book will show you how to open a door.” i sigh.  “door to purgatory. i know a demon who would have loved to have known about that. so how do you open the door?” dean asks as we all look to bobby for the answer. bobby flips over the page to see where one was ripped out.  “ask cloverfield. i’m pretty sure he’s got that page. it gets worse.”  “worse?” i ask not really enjoying this subject.  “this ain’t talking about how to take a vacation over there. this is all about opening a door to let something in.”  “bring something here.” sam says in clarification. “what?”  “i’m working on it.” we all exchange looks not excited about what bobby had just told us.  “well can you give us something?” dean asks.  “i got a name.”  “okay.”  “mother?” bobby even questions himself not completely sure.  “mother? mother of what? mother of dragons?” sam asks looking to bobby for answers.  “i wish. it says it a few times here. mother of all.”  “what the hell does &#x27;mother of all’ mean?” dean asks confused as well as all of us.  “i don’t know.” bobby says looking down.  “i can’t believe this.” i say getting up and going to the kitchen.  “what belle?” dean asks concerned.  “this is just too crazy. two days ago i read in one of my grandmothers journal about this place and how when i die i might end up there to now how were are finding out about it.” i say starting to pace walking from the kitchen back to the living room.  “what do you mean when you die you go there? you’re not a monster.” sam says looking at me confused.  “not personally. but literally i guess i am. the perks of being a natural witch are pretty good power that only grows that you don’t even have to work to get but when it comes to death that seems to be the curse. at least that’s what my grandmother thinks. everyone else in my family are practiced so they don’t go there. but i might.” i say starting to ramble looking at the three men fear dropping from my voice. “this is too scary.”,2024-07-12 18:44:38 GMT

What’s more interesting (and I can’t find a lot of vetted information on it yet) is that some of the IP addresses associated with the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025 are based in China–suggesting that despite all the HF’s declarations about how “omg China is a threat to the US!” they sure seem to be working with them. There’s some other bits the CIA might be interested in too…  They also tried to file as a 501©(3) nonprofit illegally lol so now the IRS is interested too.,2024-07-12 22:38:08 GMT

June 13 1995 North - East of Joseph Oregon sitting on the West side of a lone mountain a bright fire illuminates the night a woman’s screams are just out of reach to be heard from the town of Joseph.    “Run Lexi!! Take your sister and run!!” the woman screams to her son crouched down holding his younger sister in his hands. Lexi turns around only to see his mother being dragged into the burning rubble of their former home as she screams in fear. “Lexi!! Where’s your mother?” a man yells as the fire grows to the trees. Lexi with tears in his eyes turns to his father “She said to run”. Fear fills his fathers eyes as he runs to the burning wreckage screaming “LAUREN!!”. No one was the same after what happened that night.   (It’s a little inspired by spn if I’m being honest),2024-07-12 22:09:34 GMT

Summary: You the queen have lost the love of your life Sir Sam and vow never to fall in love with anyone again.  Bingo: a reputation song - king of my heart .  Genre: Angst and fluff. Au!Royal - 4782 words  Warnings: Grief (I think that’s all).  A/N: I’m not fluent in English so a lot of mistakes can happen.  The crowd gathered in the hall looked at you with every new step you took admiring your elegance and your attire. Your head was held high as you walked down the aisle among nobles and commoners ready to take on your responsibilities as queen.   His father the king had died a few weeks before. An unexpected death as he appeared to be in good health. And as his only daughter you were supposed to take over the throne. You weren’t afraid you had been trained and taught to be the ruler of Arcadia since you were a little girl. No one had any doubts that the kingdom would be ruled by a fair queen and everyone looked forward to the future prosperities in store for the kingdom.   You were ready to be queen but you weren’t ready to go your own way without him. If your father’s death was unexpected Sir Sam’s was even more so. The memories of your father’s wake were filled with moments of honor and respect because he had prepared you for this moment but the memories of Sir Sam’s wake were covered in tears and anguish because you expected to spend the rest of your life with him. You wanted him to be your best friend your husband and your king.   You grew up together playing and having fun in the halls of the palace. His father Sir John was head of the guard your father’s great friend and confidant. The king knew that Sir John raised his children with honor and modesty and that’s why he let you be so close to Sam. Sam would never disrespect you.   When you were 13 Sam started writing you love letters and you had already told your father that you were interested in marrying him. You were sure that you would never meet anyone like Sam and your love for each other grew every day. Sam admired you; his gaze was so sweet when he looked at you that everyone in the kingdom knew the feelings you both shared.   When Sir John died bravely defending the king in an attack on the enemy kingdom his eldest son Sir Dean took over the role of chief of the guard after which he appointed his brother as your bodyguard making the two of you even closer.   Suddenly however everything you had came to an end the same night your father died. Sir Sam died a mysterious death his body wasn’t found in its entirety only a few limbs. A horrible death. You couldn’t believe that your love had died in such a brutal way and you swore that when the person responsible for this was found justice would be done.   Here you were about to become queen but without the love of your life by your side.   You sat on the throne. You expected to feel ecstatic as soon as you sat on the throne but you couldn’t have been more indifferent at that moment. Scanning the crowd you came across some familiar faces: Sir Dean and Marquis Castiel who smiled at you and curtsied. Looking at Dean you couldn’t help but think of your brother how proud he would be to be part of your coronation but he wasn’t here he never would be.   The archbishop finally took your crown gently and approached you.   “May I present Y/N Queen of Arcadia” After saying these words the archbishop finally places the crown on your head and you quickly rise from your throne to receive the honors of those present.   “God save the queen!“ Some say.   &quot;Long live the queen!” Others exclaim.   That day your reign began but your life ended the night your great love was killed. You would never love again.   You had already been queen for two years and the kingdom was more prosperous than ever.   “How are the preparations for my meeting with Duke Singer?” You asked your lady-in-waiting Jody duchess and wife of Duke Singer. They both played important roles in your development as queen you always saw them as second parents. The duchess was just finishing putting the tiara on your head and fastening it with clips.   “Everything is in order; the duke is waiting for you in your study.&quot;   &quot;Dear Jody” you said turning back to face her “do you know what this conversation is about? Is there something wrong with the affairs of our kingdom? Another rebellion to the south?” You were worried because the enemy army insisted on plundering the crops in the south.   “Yes I know why but I’d rather my husband told you. Please don’t be anxious Your Majesty. As for the south the enemy army has already been defeated and the people are receiving all the protection they need.&quot;   &quot;That comforts me. I must go and meet Duke Singer now” Jody bowed slightly in reverence.   Ever since Sir Sam was murdered you had asked Sir Dean not to put anyone in his place so you walked alone through the castle corridors as you would normally do in Sam’s company. One of the guards waiting in front of your office door bowed to you and then opened the door where you would meet Duke Singer.   “Your Majesty I’m glad to see you. You’ve been so busy these past few days.&quot;   &quot;The kingdom has been demanding a lot of me lately Your Grace. Sometimes I think I won’t be able to cope with everything on my own but thank heaven I have faithful companions like you to help me.&quot;   &quot;That’s what I wanted to talk to you about Your Majesty” You were confused Duke Singer wanted to talk to you about his help in the kingdom? Were you making him work too hard? Or was he thinking of offering his services to someone else? You’d do anything to stop that from happening “The nobles are charging for a… marriage.&quot;   &quot;That subject again!” You exclaimed as you rolled your eyes and turned to leave the room since you weren’t willing to talk about it again.   “Your Majesty please listen! I’m not asking you to forget your love for Sir Sam God rest his soul you of all people know that i thought of him as a son. I could never ask you to stop loving him that wouldn’t be fair.&quot;   &quot;Then why do you insist on asking me to marry someone? Sam would be my husband the king of my heart and of this kingdom no one can ever take his place!&quot;   &quot;Queen think about it imagine how many benefits our kingdom will get if you get married. You know that many kingdoms give up doing business with Arcadia when they find out that an unmarried queen rules it.&quot;   &quot;They don’t think I can do it but I’ve already proved in these two years that I can.&quot;   &quot;I know you do but think of your people. If you marry a nobleman from another kingdom we can expand our army. Many people and soldiers have already died in the fighting to the south and many more will die if we do nothing. A marriage could be the key to our problems.&quot;   &quot;Are you sure about that Your Grace?&quot;   &quot;I would never ask such a thing of Your Majesty if I didn’t have the purest conviction.&quot;   &quot;You know I trust you with my eyes closed Bobby. I’m willing to consider suitors if it means my people will be safe.&quot;      ”Royal Proclamation    For the attention of all subjects of the Kingdom of Arcadia   It is with great honor and respect that we announce that Her Royal Majesty Queen Y/n is seeking suitors for holy matrimony.   At this auspicious time the royal court invites all worthy and noble-hearted gentlemen to come forward as potential consorts for our beloved queen.“   Ever since it was announced that you were looking for a husband the offers had been pouring in. Thousands of princes lords counts and dukes had come forward with the intention of obtaining your hand in marriage but none of them had pleased you enough.   You knew that none of these gentlemen would receive your love since you swore that it belonged to only one man and that man unfortunately could not claim the position as your husband. However you were looking for a man you could at least put up with for the rest of your life. With marriage you would have to fulfill your role as a wife but it sickened you to think of lying with any of these noblemen or even giving them children.   You were about to give up when Lord Gavin introduced himself. His lands were a little far away and he had few plantations but what caught your eye was his extensive mining of iron silver and gold and his vast army that possessed the most innovative weapons.   &quot;I know about your painful broken heart Your Majesty. I wonder why you took a sudden interest in me” Gavin questioned as you walked through the garden.   “You know very well what my motives were for giving you the chance to get to know me better.&quot;   &quot;My mines and my army of course” he said smugly. “You know Your Highness I don’t judge you for wanting a marriage of convenience. I too lost the woman I loved and swore never to love anyone again just like Your Majesty.&quot;   &quot;You swear? Tell me more.” You’d like to hear Gavin talk about his grief you were hoping to identify with his story and maybe the two of you could make some big agreements based on your feelings.   “There’s not much to tell. I was only a week away from my wedding to her but she suddenly fell ill and passed away soon after.” He sighed as he looked at the horizon your gaze followed his and you imagined Sam’s eyes when you saw the mixture of the sea contracting with the green moss that covered the mountains you wondered if Gavin also remembered his beloved as he looked at the scene “I’ve never felt so much pain it was as if my soul died along with hers. Since then I’ve never been close to any other woman but when I saw the proclamation saying that Your Majesty was looking for a husband I remembered how similar your story is to mine and your promise never to love another man again. So I thought we could take advantage of this situation.&quot;   &quot;And how exactly do you plan to do that Lord? You know that if we get married we’ll have to take on our responsibilities as husband and wife. And it will be impossible to keep our promises…&quot;   &quot;People don’t need to know that we haven’t consummated the marriage.&quot;   &quot;But what about the children? I’m sure we’ll be asked about the generation of an heir.” You asked feeling repulsed at the thought of begetting a son from him.   “Many kingdoms don’t have legitimate heirs these days. Wouldn’t you like to leave the throne to one of Duke and Duchess Singer’s daughters?” You immediately thought of Claire and Alex you imagined that Claire would renounce the throne as eldest daughter because she didn’t like the idea of having that kind of obligation she wanted to be free but Alex might love to be queen. Regardless of which of the two assumed the throne the kingdom would be in good hands.   “I think you may be right if you wish I’ll have our wedding announced and I’ll make sure it happens as soon as possible.&quot;   &quot;I’m happy with your decision Your Majesty” Gavin smiled debauchedly happy that he had managed to convince her. Everything was going according to plan.   After your conversation with Gavin you decided to take a walk by yourself to enjoy the morning sun and think about your decisions. Of course you weren’t happy about getting married to someone other than Sam but this arrangement would be good for both of you and you wouldn’t have to fulfill your role as wife to Gavin. He would just be your sidekick. As you were walking you were startled and two hands stopped you.   “Sir Dean you scared me!&quot;   &quot;Forgive me Your Majesty. I didn’t mean to.&quot;   &quot;You know there’s no need for formalities Dean. We’re friends. What do you want?&quot;   &quot;Are you in love with him Y/n?” He asked his voice coming out lower than usual.   “No of course not Dean! You know that my heart is and always will be your brother Sam’s.&quot;   &quot;Forgive me I don’t want you to think I’m judging you. Sam would like you to move on for this pain in your heart to go away and for you to finally be happy.&quot;   &quot;I would be happy if he were here. But… I’m marrying Gavin it’ll be a marriage of convenience we’ve agreed not to consummate the marriage and we won’t have heirs Claire or Alex will take the throne and…&quot;   &quot;Y/n you don’t have to explain yourself to me.&quot;   &quot;I just want you to know that no one will ever take Sam’s place he’ll always be the love of my life. It was supposed to be him walking me down the aisle.&quot;   &quot;Are you asking for my blessing for this marriage to take place?&quot;   &quot;I feel guilty for saying yes to another man before the crown and God I thought if you agreed I would feel better.&quot;   &quot;You know that no matter what I say this pain won’t go away… but if you want to know what I think about this marriage I think it will be good for the kingdom. I learned about the mines and Lorde’s weaponry. We will have a great advantage against the enemy army and we will be able to free the people from so much suffering. Sam will always be in our hearts but now the kingdom needs the queen to take some action” You agreed Sir Dean was right.   You looked at yourself in the mirror as you tried to hold back the tears in your eyes. You’ve always dreamed of seeing yourself in white ready to become a wife. Sam’s wife. But it wasn’t him you were going to marry tonight and the tears that insisted on welling up in your eyes weren’t of emotion but of sadness. You walked to the safe where you kept all the love letters Sam had written to you.   “My dear Y/n   Today I was admiring the fine silk that the merchant brought for the making of your next ball gown and I couldn’t help but remember how it looked with the softness of your skin. For a moment I was in a reverie remembering our nocturnal caresses. Your body under mine while my hands explored your entire body. My mouth on your breasts while you grabbed my hair and moaned softly so no one could hear soon my mouth was on yours again as I slowly filled you.   I miss nights like this with you my brother asked for reinforcements on the battle line in the South and for a while I had to abandon my post as your bodyguard but I want you to know that I will be by your side again as soon as possible. And we can enjoy our love.   With love your Sam”   “My dearly beloved princess   I was thinking about the words we said today and for me saying I love you wasn’t enough. Y/n you are the sun that lights up my darkest days bringing lightness and warmth to my heart. I dream about you every night and I always wish to be with you in my arms to love and care for you.   No one in the world will be able to overcome this overwhelming love I feel for you I know we are not old enough to get married yet but I am looking forward to that day. The only certainty I have in life is having you in marriage and becoming yours forever.   With all the love in the world your Sam”   You didn’t have time to read a few more letters as you were interrupted by Jody’s presence.   “It’s time your majesty” When the duchess investigated your eyes she knew exactly what was going through your head — You need to be brave Y/n. I’m not saying as your lady-in-waiting take this as mother to daughter advice. The deal you got with Lord Gavin was great you won’t need to break your promise.   “I know… I just” You thought about venting and crying into her lap as you grieved over the loss of Sir Sam but there was no time for that — Nothing. Should we go.“   Your legs shook as you walked down the red carpet alongside Duke Singer your heart racing with each new step and each new thought that you would soon be Lord Gavin’s wife. However with the shred of courage you had left you raised your head and continued walking.   &quot;We are gathered here to unite in marriage Queen Y/n of Arcadia and Lord Gavin of Hellcrest. Lord Gavin do you accept Queen Y/n as your lawfully wedded wife?&quot;   &quot;Yes I accept” He replied smiling. Without explanation that smile gave you goosebumps of fear.   “My queen do you accept Lord Gavin as your lawfully wedded husband?&quot;   Tension was in the air; everyone was eager for your answer. You faced the crowd hoping something would happen so you wouldn’t have to marry Lord Gavin but the only thing that could be heard was the sound of rain hitting the ground. Even the heavens were crying. You took a deep breath looked at the archbishop and then at Gavin and finally looked back at the crowd but something caught your attention… someone.   “Sam” you said softly. Realizing that you had seen him the tall man ran towards the exit but no one seemed to have seen him because when they held your gaze the gentleman had already disappeared into the fog &quot;SAM!” You shouted running down the hall while holding up your dress.   “Majesty!” Duke Bobby ran up to you holding on tightly “What’s going on?”   “Bobby I saw him. Sam is alive!&quot;   &quot;This is impossible!” It was Sir Dean’s turn to exclaim “I know this is hard for you Y/n but it was probably just a mirage. My brother hasn’t been with us for two years!&quot;   &quot;Please let me go. I swear I saw him. He’s here” You tried your best to push away the arms that held you struggling tirelessly against them. These gentlemen should know that nothing can hold a woman in love. You finally managed to escape and ran as fast as you could to try and catch up to your loved one.   The rain and fog obscured your vision but you continued running in the direction where you thought you saw Sam go. Because of the wet ground you slipped but when you were about to fall two strong arms caught you. When you looked down you realized that if he hadn’t restrained you you would have fallen into a huge cliff. You finally looked up and your stomach dropped when you saw Sam’s face looking down at you with concern.   “I got you” he said as he pulled you closer.   “Sam my love you’re alive!” Your hands went to his face brushing away the wet strands that covered his face. Sam’s smile soon appeared on his lips.   “I’m right here my princess… I mean my queen” Sam’s lips quickly met yours his grip tightened on your hair as you lost yourself even more in that kiss. Your hands snaked all over his body to make sure you weren’t dreaming the kiss was long and when it ended you could barely breathe “Come on we have to go.&quot;   &quot;What? Go where?” You looked back and a half dozen men holding torches and swords towards you “What’s going on?&quot;   &quot;We have to go; I need to keep you safe. We’ll talk later” So you started running your feet hurt from the tight shoes but you blindly trusted Sam.   “Come on come in!” Marquis Castiel was waiting for you two near a carriage “Quickly quickly” You entered the carriage and the door soon closed Marquis Castiel sat down next to the coachman and the vehicle began to move quickly.   You finally had a minute to take a deep breath Sam left you to himself and started placing kisses on your head.   “I’m sorry for staying so long for so long and making you believe that I had died. You don’t know how painful it was for me too having to stay away from my loved one for two years.&quot;   &quot;Why did you do that Sam?&quot;   &quot;Because I saw who killed your father. It was all Gavin’s big plan. On the night of the king’s death I saw Gavin attacking him and throwing poison into his mouth it took seconds for your father to die. When I drew my sword to kill Gavin and avenge the king’s death his henchmen attacked me. There were many of them and there was no other knight around. Until Gavin saw you walking along your balcony and pointed a gun in your direction he said I should go with him or else he would shoot you. He kept me imprisoned for a few days hoping that I would give out any secret information about our kingdom but I certainly didn’t.   &quot;If you managed to escape why didn’t you come back to our home and tell me what was happening?” You were confused by so much information.   “Lord Gavin’s men were already infiltrated in your palace; I couldn’t put your security at risk. I don’t know why it took him so long to put the plan into action but it gave me time to think about how I would stop him. After many weeks of travel I managed to reach the kingdom of Hellcrest and talk to King Crowley. I discovered that Gavin’s rank had been demoted from prince to lord and he had lost the right to the throne because he was against the laws of the kingdom.&quot;   The carriage was moving a lot and you got even tighter in Sam’s grip.   &quot;The army that insisted on attacking Southern Arcadia was commanded by Gavin. And it began to spread among the nobles that the Queen of Arcadia should soon find a husband. Until the proclamation was published that you were willing to marry. His plan was to marry you and kill you the same way he killed your father on your wedding night.&quot;   &quot;He knew exactly how to manipulate me telling me about the woman he had lost that he would never fall in love again and about marriage of convenience. He knew exactly what I needed to hear that I was reluctant about marriage so he proposed a marriage of convenience” You looked into Sam’s eyes “Sam I never got over you. I promised to never love another man…&quot;   &quot;I know Y/n. I was aware of everything you were going through during those two years. Dean told me everything.&quot;   &quot;He knew?” Sam casually. Dean had nicely mentioned it to you “So him giving the wedding his blessing was part of your plan?&quot;   &quot;Yes. I told all my discoveries to King Crowley who was disappointed with his son’s new attitudes so he made himself available to help. I came to Arcadia along with Hellcrest’s army to stop Gavin.&quot;   &quot;What’s going on in the palace right now?&quot;   &quot;King Crowley’s soldiers are fighting Gavin’s men.&quot;   &quot;Sam I can’t let my people be in danger! We need to go back there. I can’t run away while people die.&quot;   &quot;My queen I assure you that everything is under control. Gavin must already be dead or imprisoned and his men must have already surrendered. Everything is fine I promise.&quot;   &quot;So now we can live our love?&quot;   &quot;I now pronounce you man and wife!” Sam’s lips brushed against his with delicacy and passion. Married.  “I will always be yours my queen” Sam said as he looked into her eyes.  “You will forever be the king of my heart.”,2024-07-12 22:08:16 GMT

Mechanic Dean x Reader  Chapter Summary: First day of living with Dean everything is going perfect.  Warnings: SMUT! Watch yourself only 18+  Series Masterlist here!! &amp; Main masterlist here!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Today was my first day living with Dean and I felt both excited and nervous.   After he helped me settle in and showed me around his cozy apartment—a place that was quickly starting to feel like home—he had to go back to work. It wasn’t a big place but it had two bedrooms and a nice balcony with a view of the town. The walls were a calming grey colour decorated with art and photos that made it feel warm and inviting.  Even though I was happy to be with Dean I couldn’t shake the fear from past relationships. I was used to feeling like I always messed up or disappointed my partner. This fear made me worry that I might do something to upset Dean or ruin our relationship especially since it was so early.  Deep down I knew Dean was different—he was kind patient and understanding—but old fears still haunted me.  I spent the day searching job opportunities in the town over it was a little bit of a drive but I knew if I wanted to stay here I needed to have a source of income.  I checked the time and my heart pounded in my chest Dean was due to come home in an hour and panic set in as I realized I hadn’t even started dinner—a routine Andrew used to expect every night. But with Dean it was different. I wasn’t sure what he liked or disliked which only added to my anxiety.  I grabbed my phone and dialed his number the ringing making my nerves worse until he finally answered.  “Hey sweetheart how are you doing?” Dean’s voice was strong comfort.  “I’m good. I’m so sorry I forgot to ask what you wanted for dinner tonight” I admitted guiltily.  Dean chuckled softly. “You don’t need to make anything. It’s been a long day so I can pick something up for us on the way home.”  “Oh okay. As long as you’re sure you’re okay with that…” I hesitated needing reassurance.  Dean paused his tone gentle yet firm. “As long as we are okay with that Y/N. Are you okay with that?”  His concern touched me and I smiled biting my lip. “Yeah I am. I can’t wait to see you.”  “Same here sweetheart. See you soon.”  I hung up and headed to the bedroom to grab some clothes eager to shower. As much as I appreciated the motel’s shelter the showers were dreary. I longed for the real water pressure and a chance to unwind.   Stepping into the bathroom I undressed and let the warm water cascade over me.  As I stood there thoughts swirled. Why was I still anxious about things from the past when Dean had consistently shown me kindness and understanding? His reaction to my dinner problem was proof—he wasn’t like Andrew expecting perfection or control. Dean simply cared about what made us both comfortable and happy.  It was strange falling this hard for somebody I’ve known only two weeks. And I wish I could explain it maybe we were in over our heads or maybe we were crazy but there was this pull this deep intense love brewing between us.  I guess I must have spent longer in the shower than I realized because a knock on the door nearly caused me to slip and that’s when I realized Dean was home. He cracked the door open as I peeked out with wet hair.  “Mmm nice wet hair sweetheart” he teased with a chuckle.  I blushed but decided to play along shooting him a mischievous wink. “Maybe you’ll get to see more of wet me later.”  Dean’s eyes widened in surprise and I couldn’t help but laugh at his reaction. His cheeks and ears turned pink as he looked down smirking slightly. “Um… dinner is here. Take your time and relax. Meet me on the balcony.”  I nodded with a smile turning off the shower as Dean frowned slightly. “You didn’t need to come out now.”  “I missed you” I admitted softly. “Just give me a moment to get dressed and I’ll be out there.”  “Okay.” Dean smiled and closed the door leaving me to quickly dry off and get dressed.  I knew Dean wouldn’t mind how I dressed but I hoped tonight might lead to something more so I slipped into some leggings and the oversized t-shirt of his I loved pairing it with lacy black panties and a bra underneath. Hopefully he’d notice and appreciate the effort.  When I stepped onto the balcony I was stunned. Dean had set up candles that flickered gently in the evening breeze casting a warm glow over the table. He was sitting there looking incredibly handsome gazing out at the view.  “You look beautiful as always” Dean greeted me warmly. “Did you enjoy your shower? And is that my shirt?”  I nodded taking my seat across from him. “Yeah the motel showers are terrible. But I really like your shirt.”  He chuckled and handed me my food and drink. “Yeah I can imagine. And please keep it. It looks amazing on you.”  I smiled gratefully before my eyes widened in surprise. He had gotten me exactly what I loved—burgers and a chocolate milkshake. How did he know?  “Everything okay?” Dean’s concerned voice brought me back to the moment. I nodded smiling shyly. “Yeah… how did you know what I liked?”  Dean smirked and winked at me. “I just know you.”  I must have looked puzzled because he laughed softly. “I put the pieces together. You mentioned you love burgers and you used to get milkshakes with your dad when you were young. It’s like a comfort drink for you.”  I couldn’t help but feel touched by his thoughtfulness. Dean had been paying attention to the little details about me things I hadn’t even realized I had shared. It made me feel seen and cared for in a way I hadn’t experienced before.  As we enjoyed our meal together the evening unfolded into a perfect blend of laughter shared stories and stolen glances. Dean’s presence was a comfort his understanding and patience easing the lingering shadows of my past.  “So..” I started staring back at him. “Tell me more about your parents you said that their the only ones you’ve known to move fast like us tell me about that?”  His smile was sad but genuine as he leaned closer “My mom and Dad met at a bus shelter. He asked her for the time and she noticed he had a watch on-totally busted. But she answered anyways and as they sat there dad kept trying to come up with conversations trying to work up the courage to ask her out.”  I smirked at the thought of his parents so cute just like he was.   “Anyways by the time the bus came my mom was waiting for him to get on and he confessed he didn’t need to take the bus he just wanted to speak to the most beautiful girl in town. She fell for him right than and there-he’s a smooth talking bastard.”  I laughed loudly and shook my head “Just like you.”  His cheeks burned red and a laugh escaped his lips “Well thank you sweetheart.”  “So how long have they been together now?”  He smiled looking up to the sky. “They would have been married for 22 years. They got engaged two weeks after they met.”   My eyes widen and I almost spit out my drink “Two weeks?”  He laughed and nodded back “I told you they move fast. When they knew they knew. Just like how I feel with you…”  I couldn’t help but blush at his words. Was this really happening? Were we falling this hard already?  Our conversation flowed from serious topics to lighter ones and before we realized it hours had passed. If it were up to me I would have frozen time to stay in that moment forever.  After helping him tidy up we headed to the bedroom. Nerves fluttered in my stomach because I knew what I wanted tonight. Dean stepped out to grab some water and I grasped the opportunity. I quickly removed my leggings and shirt then climbed onto the bed and lay down ready.  Dean entered the room and smiled at me then his gaze fell upon the little clothing I wore. His jaw dropped and his eyes widened taking in every inch of me that was visible.   I expected to feel self-conscious but instead I just felt his love and passion all around us heating up the room.  I sat up and smiled giving him a playful wink. “Any thoughts?”  He swallowed hard putting the glass down on the dresser before coming towards the bed his eyes locked on mine. “Oh sweetheart I’m having plenty of thoughts right now.. God damn.”  I smirked as my cheeks burned and the butterflies filled my belly. “Well why don’t you get down here and we could act some of them out?”  His breathing hitch and he chuckled climbing onto the bed and slowly on top of me. His knee moved between my legs pressing his body against mine.   My hands moved to his arms pulling him more on top of me wanting him impossibly close. He dipped down as his lips hit mine and this time it was filled with passion and desire.  His hand moved down to my cheek rubbing the skin gently as his other hand trailed down my stomach. His fingers were burning my skin as he moved them lower every part of me was craving more.  His lips moved down to my cheek then my neck then my chest as he began kissing licking and nibbling at the skin he had access to. I couldn’t supress the moan that left my mouth as his hand moved lower tracing my hips and thighs marking me for him.  His eyes locked into mine as his hands went lower watching to make sure I was okay that I was ready. I nodded and bit my lip as he pushed his hand underneath my panties and rested in between my legs where I needed him the most.  His head dropped a deep groan escaping his lips as his fingers played at my entrance feeling how ready I was for him. His lips moved lower licking the spot on my collarbone that he admired as his fingers pushed deeply inside of me.  I held onto his shoulders with a gasp not expecting to be filled so deeply so roughly so irresistibly. He moved his fingers faster inside and harder concentrating on what made me tick what made my back arch and continuing to push me.   I could feel my heart pounding in my ears vision going white as my body trembled underneath him I was so close already and he’s barely touched me.  His fingers pushed harder inside of me as his other pulled my panties completly off moving down to settle between my legs. I knew where this was headed and instantly nerves flooded my system this has never happened before.  My hands were trembling as I reached his cheek his movements stilling as his eyes moving instantly to look at me. “Dean.. you don’t have to do that..”  His eyebrows furrowed in confusion as a dirty smirk spread across his lips. “Do what? Go down on you? Do you not want me to?”  I swallowed hard and closed my eyes “I uh… Nobody’s ever…”  His eyes widened when he realized what I meant his head lifting slightly to stare back at me “I really want to… Can I show you how good it feels? If you don’t like it I can stop..”  I smiled and felt relief wash over me he was doing this because he wanted to not because he felt like he had to. He smirked as his head moved lower licking his fingers before pushing them back into me before he leaned forward licking a strip from the top to where his fingers were.  I shivered as a gasp left my mouth causing him to chuckle. “Feels good?”  I nodded silently and without hesitation his tongue was swirling around my clit stopping to suck while his fingers pumped faster harder deeper.  I moaned loudly into my fist as he pushed me to the breaking point his tongue writing love notes all inside me as he moved his hand to my clit chuckling when my back arched.  This was it the release my body was craving and he knew it. He lifted his head for a moment eyes falling on my body. “C&#x27;mon sweetheart. Let me feel you cum for me.”  I closed my eyes tightly as the pleasure coursed through my body. Flashes of white clouded my vision and my entire body was trembling to the point where Dean held my legs down fingers still pumping deep inside. “Oh fuck yeah that’s it sweetheart let go.”  As I finally came down from the high Dean climbed back over me placing kisses all over my lips and neck a chuckle vibrating against my skin.  I laughed and pulled him on top of me kissing his lips hard and desperately. I needed him I needed to feel him and he knew it. He kissed me harder and groaned into my neck while my hand wrapped moved to the front of his jeans pawing his already solid erection.  He moaned low in his throat as his hand on my shoulder. “Jesus sweetheart your&#x27;e going to kill me.”  I smirked and lifted his head to face me “No i’m just going to fuck you.”  He groaned at my response licked his lips before stripping off his jeans and boxers and climbing back over me. His hand moved lower holding his cock and lining it up with my entrance. His mouth dropped and I knew he was about to ask if I was ready so I quickly wrapped my legs around him pulling him into me pushing him fully inside of me without warning.  He inhaled a deep shaky breath as his head dropped eyes slammed shut. “H-Holy fuck Y/N…”  My smile was wide as I pulled him lower kissing his lips desperatly silently begging him to move. He chuckled low as he sat up slightly hand moving to my hair lips hovering over mine before he pulled out and slammed back in roughly.  My back arched and his hand slipped underneath me pulling me impossibly close as he repeated the action-pulling out and slamming deep inside me deeper than I’ve ever felt.  We were desperate falling apart around each other trying our hardest to hold onto this feeling forever. My moans got louder and more strangled and his growls were just bringing me closer the sight of him like this was a dream come true.  His eyes fluttered open a lazy smile playing at his lips. “Fuck you’re perfect.”  My hand moved to his back scratching the skin gently smirking at the way his eyes lit up. “Dean… I’m so close.”  He hummed in approval as he leaned closer licking the area around my neck before biting it gently. “I’m right behind you baby c&#x27;mon.. give me another one.”  I could feel the pressure building and my entire body was trembling underneath him but he held me dedicated to getting me there. His moans grew louder and breathy as he watched me fall apart and suddenly he couldn’t fall hold on anymore. He let go with me filling me all the way hands gripping at me tightly.  He slowed his movements his forehead resting against mine as the room filled with our heavy breathing and soft sighs.  I smiled up at him tears welling in my eyes. I didn’t mean to get emotional I really didn’t want to but everything felt so right. It was like everything was falling into place like he had rescued me.  He moved to lay beside me his eyes filling with concern as he stared at the tears starting to fall down my cheeks. “Oh sweetheart are you okay?”  “Yeah.. I’m sorry.” I whispered my hands moving to my face to try to hide my eyes from him. He kissed my hands over and over slowly pulling them off so I could see him.  “What’s wrong?”  I shook my head frantically and turned to look at him “Nothing! That was just… really amazing. I’ve never felt that connection before it was a little overwhelming..”  He smirked and lay down beside me pulling me close to his chest. “I’ve never felt a connection like that either. I can’t believe how close I feel to you.”  I kissed his chest and gazed up at him. “I think I love you.”  His smile grew wide as his lips kissed my head “I think I love you too sweetheart. Get some sleep. I’ll be here.”  I nodded resting my head on his chest. Everything finally felt perfect and right in my life and I cherished it. Yet I couldn’t shake the fear that something might take it all away. Deep down I sensed I might be right.  Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it! Chapter 6 coming soon stay tuned!

I only want to hold you Word count: 1676  Tags:   Episode s12e02 Mamma Mia (Supernatural) Hurt No Comfort Implied Sexual Content Implied/Referenced Torture Psychological Torture Hallucinations Witchcraft   Summary:  Sam is shot and captured by the British Men of Letters and tortured for information. He’s not about to give it all up to some assholes with a hot poker and knife not after facing the devil himself and coming out alive.  But unfortunately for Sam they quickly work out no amount of ice baths will get him to talk so they try something else.   Something even the devil himself hadn’t had the balls to try.      &lt;!-- more --&gt; ——————————————————————————     “You see Sam if you answer my questions you walk right out that door.” A pen gestured to the wooden staircase. “I promise.”  Sam swallowed his dry throat practically burning he pulled at the chains silently considering his options. “Pass.”  “Sam-” The voice tried.  “You can ask me any kind of question you want. The answer is going to be the exact same screw you.” His voice was rough his face void of any emotion.   “You want to get mad? You want to get mean?” He leant forward in his chair well as much as he could with his arms chained behind his back his eyes narrowing. “I’ve been tortured by the devil himself. So you you’re just an accent in a pantsuit.” He tilted his head mockingly a menacing smile that would cause anyone to turn tail and run. “What can you do to me?”     A pen clicked.      The sound of a faucet.     Running water.      The cold like needles digging into his skin his muscles seizing up his bones aching.      “Screw you.”     The sudden burning feeling of heat on his foot flames eating away at the skin.      “Screw you.”     The voices loud and imposing his mind and body screaming at him. The glass cutting through his palm like it had so many times before his blood pouring down his arm.      “Screw you.”     An electric shock coursing through his body.      “Screw you.”     And then nothing.      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Sam’s eyes lazily flickered open the sound of covers rustling causing him to roll over grabbing at the warm body next to him a reluctant groan filling the dark room as he pulled his angel in close to his chest tucking him under his chin.  “We have to get up some time sweetheart.” Gabriel whispered rubbing his nose against the length of Sam’s neck. “Old Deano will be throwing a fit if he finds out you haven’t briefed me on those names yet.”     “All you have to do is give me the names of the hunters Sam.”  “Screw you.”      Sam flinched slightly as a sudden burst of pain shot up his leg he shook it off his attention going back to Gabriel. “Please don’t bring up my brother when we are literally lying in my bed naked.” Sam’s nose wrinkled slightly. “How would you like it if I brought up Cas right now?”  “Okay point taken.” The archangel chuckled craning his head so he could press an apologetic kiss to the space behind Sam’s ear causing the hunter to shiver slightly the action making his body tense with pain. Sam couldn’t help but frown with confusion not that he was given much time to form any thoughts instantly distracted by the way Gabriel leaned up lips tracing the shell of his ear as he whispered. “Anyway do you know how long I’ve been trying to get you like this? Not about to let you put the seven layers of plaid back on after I finally got it off you.”  Sam rolled his eyes fondly his cheeks pleasantly warm from the gentle hand that was skating up and down his arm in a comforting manner. “It wasn’t seven you ass.”  “It most certainly was” Gabriel teased turning around fully in Sam’s arms so that he could plant his hands on Sam’s warm chest Sam reluctantly rolling onto his back so that Gabriel could lie down on top of him the angel’s arms folded on the hunter’s chest as his chin rested on them. “And anyway” He smirked “You love my ass.”   Sam made a noncommittal hum his hand automatically going to Gabriel’s hair his blunt nails scratching at the base of the angel’s neck the angel instantly arching into the touch like a love starved cat. Sam couldn’t believe how lucky he was that he got to have this to hold Gabriel.   It was so domestic the pair of them laying in bed cocooned by the warmth of Sam’s covers Gabriel snapping up some clothes for them much to both their dismay. “Wouldn’t have to Samsquatch if you weren’t shaking so much.” He chuckled thumb brushing against the small pout on Sam’s face.   Sam frowned. “Not sure why it’s pretty warm in here.”      “What a cold shower? Is that the best you can do?”      He pressed a light kiss to the pad of Gabriel’s thumb rolling his eyes again as he tugged at the white t-shirt that Gabriel was wearing. “But if you were really worried about me being cold you would have also given me a shirt as well not just some extremely hideous plaid pyjama bottoms.”  The angel’s cheeks became a dusted pink an innocent look on his face “Well that’s what I’m here for sweetheart it’s my job to keep you warm.” He smiled leaning up to give Sam a peck on the lips that the hunter quickly returned. “And don’t diss the pyjamas” He whispered against Sam’s lips. “With those on we’re matching.”  Sam looked down quickly noticing that the angel wasn’t lying they both wore the same pair of ugly green and pink with strips of yellow plaid pj bottoms. Like a couple his mind supplied for him the thought making his cheeks warm and his heart ache.  “Be glad I stopped there” Gabriel snickered clearly not noticing the sudden revelations that Sam was having. “Could have made you wear a shirt now couldn’t I? Imagine how you would look in a green and pink plaid shirt?”   Sam didn’t say anything staring silently at the fabric.  “You like them?” Gabriel’s voice dropped to a whisper his voice suddenly unsure.  The change in Gabriel’s confident nattering snapped Sam out of his thoughts without hesitation Sam breathed “I love them.” His hand returned to the angel’s hair so that he could tug him down into a kiss one that hopefully showed just how much the gesture meant to him.  This must be love he couldn’t help but think as he felt Gabriel’s relieved laugh vibrate through his throat and chest the pair so intertwined that Sam could feel every breath that he took every sound that he made.   The soft smile on his face quickly faltered though his eyes looking up at the angel that straddled his waist tracing every inch of Gabriel’s face checking to see if anything was missing if anything wasn’t quite right if it could all just be a dream or god forbid a hallucination.      “The names Sam. How many hunters are in the network?”  “Screw you.”      It was like it wasn’t up to Sam any time he found himself smiling or a wondrous warmth spread through his chest he could practically feel it drain from his body chased away by an all consuming doubt.  Sam couldn’t help but fall into the trap his mind running circles around him as fear consumed him his smile buried under years of memories of grief. So distracted that he jumped when Gabriel’s warm fingers closed around his wrist the motion an attempt at grounding him in the moment the angel trying to pull him from the depths of his mind.   Gabriel looked at him head tilted in concern as his thumb brushed the soft skin of Sam’s arm in a calming manner. “What’s going on in that big moose sized head of yours sweetheart?”   Sam sighed his voice was small almost broken as he whispered the question he feared most. “You are here right? With me?”  The words seemed to shatter the angel the look of bliss on his face quickly replaced with one of pain. “Sam” He whispered quietly the low tone not quite hiding the hurt behind his careful words. “I have done many things but this isn’t a trick I would pull on you.”   Sam looked away from the former Trickster the air in the room suddenly thick as he tried to see where he was nothing was easily identifiable in the dark no matter how much time he gave his eyes to adjust.   “Hey no” Gabriel’s voice hardened as he lifted his head reaching for Sam’s face with his hands gently pushing the hunter to look back at him. “None of that.” He cupped Sam’s face his thumb brushing the dark bags under the hunter’s eyes. “I am here we are here together.”     “Is it possible that anyone could have been compromised? Bought?”   “Screw you.”     “I- I don’t know if we are” Sam whispered leaning into the touch craving it fearing it would be ripped away. “If you are.”   Gabriel leaned forward resting his forehead to Sam’s their noses brushing against each other. “Sweetheart there is nowhere else I would rather be. Warm and safe with you.”      Gabriel where are you?  Please Gabe.  I’ll see you later sweetheart.      “No.” Sam choked that all familiar wave of grief and defeat washing through him. “No you aren’t Gabriel. You aren’t my Gabriel.” Sam leaned up pressing his forehead harder against the angel’s his hand slipping it his hair once more securing Gabriel in his hold.   “And that’s okay” He whispered his voice shaking his entire body trembling. “Because right now I just want to hold you just a little while longer.”   “Sam-“  “Please.” Sam begged forcing his body to stay relaxed to stay in the moment. “It’s been so long I forgot Gabe I’m forgetting you.” A tear slid down his cheek. “I can’t forget you Gabriel let me stay.”     “Then answer the question Sam.” A voice echoed around him the sound distant just out of reach. “Tell me what I want to know and you can stay there with him for as long as you want.”     “You know what to do sweetheart.” The figment of Gabriel whispered. “You know what’s right.”   “I don’t-”  “Yes you do” He insisted the conviction in his voice startling. “I’ll be here Sam not gonna let you forget me any time soon.”   Fingers brushed Sam’s cheek wiping the tears that had sprung forth soft murmurs urging him to do the right thing on his lips.      “Screw you.”  A sigh. “I really thought you would be smarter than that Sam oh well.”,2024-07-13 01:28:17 GMT

Mechanic Dean x Reader  Chapter Summary: First day of living with Dean everything is going perfect.  Warnings: SMUT! Watch yourself only 18+  Series Masterlist here!! &amp; Main masterlist here!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Today was my first day living with Dean and I felt both excited and nervous.   After he helped me settle in and showed me around his cozy apartment—a place that was quickly starting to feel like home—he had to go back to work. It wasn’t a big place but it had two bedrooms and a nice balcony with a view of the town. The walls were a calming grey colour decorated with art and photos that made it feel warm and inviting.  Even though I was happy to be with Dean I couldn’t shake the fear from past relationships. I was used to feeling like I always messed up or disappointed my partner. This fear made me worry that I might do something to upset Dean or ruin our relationship especially since it was so early.  Deep down I knew Dean was different—he was kind patient and understanding—but old fears still haunted me.  I spent the day searching job opportunities in the town over it was a little bit of a drive but I knew if I wanted to stay here I needed to have a source of income.  I checked the time and my heart pounded in my chest Dean was due to come home in an hour and panic set in as I realized I hadn’t even started dinner—a routine Andrew used to expect every night. But with Dean it was different. I wasn’t sure what he liked or disliked which only added to my anxiety.  I grabbed my phone and dialed his number the ringing making my nerves worse until he finally answered.  “Hey sweetheart how are you doing?” Dean’s voice was strong comfort.  “I’m good. I’m so sorry I forgot to ask what you wanted for dinner tonight” I admitted guiltily.  Dean chuckled softly. “You don’t need to make anything. It’s been a long day so I can pick something up for us on the way home.”  “Oh okay. As long as you’re sure you’re okay with that…” I hesitated needing reassurance.  Dean paused his tone gentle yet firm. “As long as we are okay with that Y/N. Are you okay with that?”  His concern touched me and I smiled biting my lip. “Yeah I am. I can’t wait to see you.”  “Same here sweetheart. See you soon.”  I hung up and headed to the bedroom to grab some clothes eager to shower. As much as I appreciated the motel’s shelter the showers were dreary. I longed for the real water pressure and a chance to unwind.   Stepping into the bathroom I undressed and let the warm water cascade over me.  As I stood there thoughts swirled. Why was I still anxious about things from the past when Dean had consistently shown me kindness and understanding? His reaction to my dinner problem was proof—he wasn’t like Andrew expecting perfection or control. Dean simply cared about what made us both comfortable and happy.  It was strange falling this hard for somebody I’ve known only two weeks. And I wish I could explain it maybe we were in over our heads or maybe we were crazy but there was this pull this deep intense love brewing between us.  I guess I must have spent longer in the shower than I realized because a knock on the door nearly caused me to slip and that’s when I realized Dean was home. He cracked the door open as I peeked out with wet hair.  “Mmm nice wet hair sweetheart” he teased with a chuckle.  I blushed but decided to play along shooting him a mischievous wink. “Maybe you’ll get to see more of wet me later.”  Dean’s eyes widened in surprise and I couldn’t help but laugh at his reaction. His cheeks and ears turned pink as he looked down smirking slightly. “Um… dinner is here. Take your time and relax. Meet me on the balcony.”  I nodded with a smile turning off the shower as Dean frowned slightly. “You didn’t need to come out now.”  “I missed you” I admitted softly. “Just give me a moment to get dressed and I’ll be out there.”  “Okay.” Dean smiled and closed the door leaving me to quickly dry off and get dressed.  I knew Dean wouldn’t mind how I dressed but I hoped tonight might lead to something more so I slipped into some leggings and the oversized t-shirt of his I loved pairing it with lacy black panties and a bra underneath. Hopefully he’d notice and appreciate the effort.  When I stepped onto the balcony I was stunned. Dean had set up candles that flickered gently in the evening breeze casting a warm glow over the table. He was sitting there looking incredibly handsome gazing out at the view.  “You look beautiful as always” Dean greeted me warmly. “Did you enjoy your shower? And is that my shirt?”  I nodded taking my seat across from him. “Yeah the motel showers are terrible. But I really like your shirt.”  He chuckled and handed me my food and drink. “Yeah I can imagine. And please keep it. It looks amazing on you.”  I smiled gratefully before my eyes widened in surprise. He had gotten me exactly what I loved—burgers and a chocolate milkshake. How did he know?  “Everything okay?” Dean’s concerned voice brought me back to the moment. I nodded smiling shyly. “Yeah… how did you know what I liked?”  Dean smirked and winked at me. “I just know you.”  I must have looked puzzled because he laughed softly. “I put the pieces together. You mentioned you love burgers and you used to get milkshakes with your dad when you were young. It’s like a comfort drink for you.”  I couldn’t help but feel touched by his thoughtfulness. Dean had been paying attention to the little details about me things I hadn’t even realized I had shared. It made me feel seen and cared for in a way I hadn’t experienced before.  As we enjoyed our meal together the evening unfolded into a perfect blend of laughter shared stories and stolen glances. Dean’s presence was a comfort his understanding and patience easing the lingering shadows of my past.  “So..” I started staring back at him. “Tell me more about your parents you said that their the only ones you’ve known to move fast like us tell me about that?”  His smile was sad but genuine as he leaned closer “My mom and Dad met at a bus shelter. He asked her for the time and she noticed he had a watch on-totally busted. But she answered anyways and as they sat there dad kept trying to come up with conversations trying to work up the courage to ask her out.”  I smirked at the thought of his parents so cute just like he was.   “Anyways by the time the bus came my mom was waiting for him to get on and he confessed he didn’t need to take the bus he just wanted to speak to the most beautiful girl in town. She fell for him right than and there-he’s a smooth talking bastard.”  I laughed loudly and shook my head “Just like you.”  His cheeks burned red and a laugh escaped his lips “Well thank you sweetheart.”  “So how long have they been together now?”  He smiled looking up to the sky. “They would have been married for 22 years. They got engaged two weeks after they met.”   My eyes widen and I almost spit out my drink “Two weeks?”  He laughed and nodded back “I told you they move fast. When they knew they knew. Just like how I feel with you…”  I couldn’t help but blush at his words. Was this really happening? Were we falling this hard already?  Our conversation flowed from serious topics to lighter ones and before we realized it hours had passed. If it were up to me I would have frozen time to stay in that moment forever.  After helping him tidy up we headed to the bedroom. Nerves fluttered in my stomach because I knew what I wanted tonight. Dean stepped out to grab some water and I grasped the opportunity. I quickly removed my leggings and shirt then climbed onto the bed and lay down ready.  Dean entered the room and smiled at me then his gaze fell upon the little clothing I wore. His jaw dropped and his eyes widened taking in every inch of me that was visible.   I expected to feel self-conscious but instead I just felt his love and passion all around us heating up the room.  I sat up and smiled giving him a playful wink. “Any thoughts?”  He swallowed hard putting the glass down on the dresser before coming towards the bed his eyes locked on mine. “Oh sweetheart I’m having plenty of thoughts right now.. God damn.”  I smirked as my cheeks burned and the butterflies filled my belly. “Well why don’t you get down here and we could act some of them out?”  His breathing hitch and he chuckled climbing onto the bed and slowly on top of me. His knee moved between my legs pressing his body against mine.   My hands moved to his arms pulling him more on top of me wanting him impossibly close. He dipped down as his lips hit mine and this time it was filled with passion and desire.  His hand moved down to my cheek rubbing the skin gently as his other hand trailed down my stomach. His fingers were burning my skin as he moved them lower every part of me was craving more.  His lips moved down to my cheek then my neck then my chest as he began kissing licking and nibbling at the skin he had access to. I couldn’t supress the moan that left my mouth as his hand moved lower tracing my hips and thighs marking me for him.  His eyes locked into mine as his hands went lower watching to make sure I was okay that I was ready. I nodded and bit my lip as he pushed his hand underneath my panties and rested in between my legs where I needed him the most.  His head dropped a deep groan escaping his lips as his fingers played at my entrance feeling how ready I was for him. His lips moved lower licking the spot on my collarbone that he admired as his fingers pushed deeply inside of me.  I held onto his shoulders with a gasp not expecting to be filled so deeply so roughly so irresistibly. He moved his fingers faster inside and harder concentrating on what made me tick what made my back arch and continuing to push me.   I could feel my heart pounding in my ears vision going white as my body trembled underneath him I was so close already and he’s barely touched me.  His fingers pushed harder inside of me as his other pulled my panties completly off moving down to settle between my legs. I knew where this was headed and instantly nerves flooded my system this has never happened before.  My hands were trembling as I reached his cheek his movements stilling as his eyes moving instantly to look at me. “Dean.. you don’t have to do that..”  His eyebrows furrowed in confusion as a dirty smirk spread across his lips. “Do what? Go down on you? Do you not want me to?”  I swallowed hard and closed my eyes “I uh… Nobody’s ever…”  His eyes widened when he realized what I meant his head lifting slightly to stare back at me “I really want to… Can I show you how good it feels? If you don’t like it I can stop..”  I smiled and felt relief wash over me he was doing this because he wanted to not because he felt like he had to. He smirked as his head moved lower licking his fingers before pushing them back into me before he leaned forward licking a strip from the top to where his fingers were.  I shivered as a gasp left my mouth causing him to chuckle. “Feels good?”  I nodded silently and without hesitation his tongue was swirling around my clit stopping to suck while his fingers pumped faster harder deeper.  I moaned loudly into my fist as he pushed me to the breaking point his tongue writing love notes all inside me as he moved his hand to my clit chuckling when my back arched.  This was it the release my body was craving and he knew it. He lifted his head for a moment eyes falling on my body. “C&#x27;mon sweetheart. Let me feel you cum for me.”  I closed my eyes tightly as the pleasure coursed through my body. Flashes of white clouded my vision and my entire body was trembling to the point where Dean held my legs down fingers still pumping deep inside. “Oh fuck yeah that’s it sweetheart let go.”  As I finally came down from the high Dean climbed back over me placing kisses all over my lips and neck a chuckle vibrating against my skin.  I laughed and pulled him on top of me kissing his lips hard and desperately. I needed him I needed to feel him and he knew it. He kissed me harder and groaned into my neck while my hand wrapped moved to the front of his jeans pawing his already solid erection.  He moaned low in his throat as his hand on my shoulder. “Jesus sweetheart your&#x27;e going to kill me.”  I smirked and lifted his head to face me “No i’m just going to fuck you.”  He groaned at my response licked his lips before stripping off his jeans and boxers and climbing back over me. His hand moved lower holding his cock and lining it up with my entrance. His mouth dropped and I knew he was about to ask if I was ready so I quickly wrapped my legs around him pulling him into me pushing him fully inside of me without warning.  He inhaled a deep shaky breath as his head dropped eyes slammed shut. “H-Holy fuck Y/N…”  My smile was wide as I pulled him lower kissing his lips desperatly silently begging him to move. He chuckled low as he sat up slightly hand moving to my hair lips hovering over mine before he pulled out and slammed back in roughly.  My back arched and his hand slipped underneath me pulling me impossibly close as he repeated the action-pulling out and slamming deep inside me deeper than I’ve ever felt.  We were desperate falling apart around each other trying our hardest to hold onto this feeling forever. My moans got louder and more strangled and his growls were just bringing me closer the sight of him like this was a dream come true.  His eyes fluttered open a lazy smile playing at his lips. “Fuck you’re perfect.”  My hand moved to his back scratching the skin gently smirking at the way his eyes lit up. “Dean… I’m so close.”  He hummed in approval as he leaned closer licking the area around my neck before biting it gently. “I’m right behind you baby c&#x27;mon.. give me another one.”  I could feel the pressure building and my entire body was trembling underneath him but he held me dedicated to getting me there. His moans grew louder and breathy as he watched me fall apart and suddenly he couldn’t fall hold on anymore. He let go with me filling me all the way hands gripping at me tightly.  He slowed his movements his forehead resting against mine as the room filled with our heavy breathing and soft sighs.  I smiled up at him tears welling in my eyes. I didn’t mean to get emotional I really didn’t want to but everything felt so right. It was like everything was falling into place like he had rescued me.  He moved to lay beside me his eyes filling with concern as he stared at the tears starting to fall down my cheeks. “Oh sweetheart are you okay?”  “Yeah.. I’m sorry.” I whispered my hands moving to my face to try to hide my eyes from him. He kissed my hands over and over slowly pulling them off so I could see him.  “What’s wrong?”  I shook my head frantically and turned to look at him “Nothing! That was just… really amazing. I’ve never felt that connection before it was a little overwhelming..”  He smirked and lay down beside me pulling me close to his chest. “I’ve never felt a connection like that either. I can’t believe how close I feel to you.”  I kissed his chest and gazed up at him. “I think I love you.”  His smile grew wide as his lips kissed my head “I think I love you too sweetheart. Get some sleep. I’ll be here.”  I nodded resting my head on his chest. Everything finally felt perfect and right in my life and I cherished it. Yet I couldn’t shake the fear that something might take it all away. Deep down I sensed I might be right.  Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it! Chapter 6 coming soon stay tuned!

I only want to hold you Word count: 1676  Tags:   Episode s12e02 Mamma Mia (Supernatural) Hurt No Comfort Implied Sexual Content Implied/Referenced Torture Psychological Torture Hallucinations Witchcraft   Summary:  Sam is shot and captured by the British Men of Letters and tortured for information. He’s not about to give it all up to some assholes with a hot poker and knife not after facing the devil himself and coming out alive.  But unfortunately for Sam they quickly work out no amount of ice baths will get him to talk so they try something else.   Something even the devil himself hadn’t had the balls to try.      &lt;!-- more --&gt; ——————————————————————————     “You see Sam if you answer my questions you walk right out that door.” A pen gestured to the wooden staircase. “I promise.”  Sam swallowed his dry throat practically burning he pulled at the chains silently considering his options. “Pass.”  “Sam-” The voice tried.  “You can ask me any kind of question you want. The answer is going to be the exact same screw you.” His voice was rough his face void of any emotion.   “You want to get mad? You want to get mean?” He leant forward in his chair well as much as he could with his arms chained behind his back his eyes narrowing. “I’ve been tortured by the devil himself. So you you’re just an accent in a pantsuit.” He tilted his head mockingly a menacing smile that would cause anyone to turn tail and run. “What can you do to me?”     A pen clicked.      The sound of a faucet.     Running water.      The cold like needles digging into his skin his muscles seizing up his bones aching.      “Screw you.”     The sudden burning feeling of heat on his foot flames eating away at the skin.      “Screw you.”     The voices loud and imposing his mind and body screaming at him. The glass cutting through his palm like it had so many times before his blood pouring down his arm.      “Screw you.”     An electric shock coursing through his body.      “Screw you.”     And then nothing.      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Sam’s eyes lazily flickered open the sound of covers rustling causing him to roll over grabbing at the warm body next to him a reluctant groan filling the dark room as he pulled his angel in close to his chest tucking him under his chin.  “We have to get up some time sweetheart.” Gabriel whispered rubbing his nose against the length of Sam’s neck. “Old Deano will be throwing a fit if he finds out you haven’t briefed me on those names yet.”     “All you have to do is give me the names of the hunters Sam.”  “Screw you.”      Sam flinched slightly as a sudden burst of pain shot up his leg he shook it off his attention going back to Gabriel. “Please don’t bring up my brother when we are literally lying in my bed naked.” Sam’s nose wrinkled slightly. “How would you like it if I brought up Cas right now?”  “Okay point taken.” The archangel chuckled craning his head so he could press an apologetic kiss to the space behind Sam’s ear causing the hunter to shiver slightly the action making his body tense with pain. Sam couldn’t help but frown with confusion not that he was given much time to form any thoughts instantly distracted by the way Gabriel leaned up lips tracing the shell of his ear as he whispered. “Anyway do you know how long I’ve been trying to get you like this? Not about to let you put the seven layers of plaid back on after I finally got it off you.”  Sam rolled his eyes fondly his cheeks pleasantly warm from the gentle hand that was skating up and down his arm in a comforting manner. “It wasn’t seven you ass.”  “It most certainly was” Gabriel teased turning around fully in Sam’s arms so that he could plant his hands on Sam’s warm chest Sam reluctantly rolling onto his back so that Gabriel could lie down on top of him the angel’s arms folded on the hunter’s chest as his chin rested on them. “And anyway” He smirked “You love my ass.”   Sam made a noncommittal hum his hand automatically going to Gabriel’s hair his blunt nails scratching at the base of the angel’s neck the angel instantly arching into the touch like a love starved cat. Sam couldn’t believe how lucky he was that he got to have this to hold Gabriel.   It was so domestic the pair of them laying in bed cocooned by the warmth of Sam’s covers Gabriel snapping up some clothes for them much to both their dismay. “Wouldn’t have to Samsquatch if you weren’t shaking so much.” He chuckled thumb brushing against the small pout on Sam’s face.   Sam frowned. “Not sure why it’s pretty warm in here.”      “What a cold shower? Is that the best you can do?”      He pressed a light kiss to the pad of Gabriel’s thumb rolling his eyes again as he tugged at the white t-shirt that Gabriel was wearing. “But if you were really worried about me being cold you would have also given me a shirt as well not just some extremely hideous plaid pyjama bottoms.”  The angel’s cheeks became a dusted pink an innocent look on his face “Well that’s what I’m here for sweetheart it’s my job to keep you warm.” He smiled leaning up to give Sam a peck on the lips that the hunter quickly returned. “And don’t diss the pyjamas” He whispered against Sam’s lips. “With those on we’re matching.”  Sam looked down quickly noticing that the angel wasn’t lying they both wore the same pair of ugly green and pink with strips of yellow plaid pj bottoms. Like a couple his mind supplied for him the thought making his cheeks warm and his heart ache.  “Be glad I stopped there” Gabriel snickered clearly not noticing the sudden revelations that Sam was having. “Could have made you wear a shirt now couldn’t I? Imagine how you would look in a green and pink plaid shirt?”   Sam didn’t say anything staring silently at the fabric.  “You like them?” Gabriel’s voice dropped to a whisper his voice suddenly unsure.  The change in Gabriel’s confident nattering snapped Sam out of his thoughts without hesitation Sam breathed “I love them.” His hand returned to the angel’s hair so that he could tug him down into a kiss one that hopefully showed just how much the gesture meant to him.  This must be love he couldn’t help but think as he felt Gabriel’s relieved laugh vibrate through his throat and chest the pair so intertwined that Sam could feel every breath that he took every sound that he made.   The soft smile on his face quickly faltered though his eyes looking up at the angel that straddled his waist tracing every inch of Gabriel’s face checking to see if anything was missing if anything wasn’t quite right if it could all just be a dream or god forbid a hallucination.      “The names Sam. How many hunters are in the network?”  “Screw you.”      It was like it wasn’t up to Sam any time he found himself smiling or a wondrous warmth spread through his chest he could practically feel it drain from his body chased away by an all consuming doubt.  Sam couldn’t help but fall into the trap his mind running circles around him as fear consumed him his smile buried under years of memories of grief. So distracted that he jumped when Gabriel’s warm fingers closed around his wrist the motion an attempt at grounding him in the moment the angel trying to pull him from the depths of his mind.   Gabriel looked at him head tilted in concern as his thumb brushed the soft skin of Sam’s arm in a calming manner. “What’s going on in that big moose sized head of yours sweetheart?”   Sam sighed his voice was small almost broken as he whispered the question he feared most. “You are here right? With me?”  The words seemed to shatter the angel the look of bliss on his face quickly replaced with one of pain. “Sam” He whispered quietly the low tone not quite hiding the hurt behind his careful words. “I have done many things but this isn’t a trick I would pull on you.”   Sam looked away from the former Trickster the air in the room suddenly thick as he tried to see where he was nothing was easily identifiable in the dark no matter how much time he gave his eyes to adjust.   “Hey no” Gabriel’s voice hardened as he lifted his head reaching for Sam’s face with his hands gently pushing the hunter to look back at him. “None of that.” He cupped Sam’s face his thumb brushing the dark bags under the hunter’s eyes. “I am here we are here together.”     “Is it possible that anyone could have been compromised? Bought?”   “Screw you.”     “I- I don’t know if we are” Sam whispered leaning into the touch craving it fearing it would be ripped away. “If you are.”   Gabriel leaned forward resting his forehead to Sam’s their noses brushing against each other. “Sweetheart there is nowhere else I would rather be. Warm and safe with you.”      Gabriel where are you?  Please Gabe.  I’ll see you later sweetheart.      “No.” Sam choked that all familiar wave of grief and defeat washing through him. “No you aren’t Gabriel. You aren’t my Gabriel.” Sam leaned up pressing his forehead harder against the angel’s his hand slipping it his hair once more securing Gabriel in his hold.   “And that’s okay” He whispered his voice shaking his entire body trembling. “Because right now I just want to hold you just a little while longer.”   “Sam-“  “Please.” Sam begged forcing his body to stay relaxed to stay in the moment. “It’s been so long I forgot Gabe I’m forgetting you.” A tear slid down his cheek. “I can’t forget you Gabriel let me stay.”     “Then answer the question Sam.” A voice echoed around him the sound distant just out of reach. “Tell me what I want to know and you can stay there with him for as long as you want.”     “You know what to do sweetheart.” The figment of Gabriel whispered. “You know what’s right.”   “I don’t-”  “Yes you do” He insisted the conviction in his voice startling. “I’ll be here Sam not gonna let you forget me any time soon.”   Fingers brushed Sam’s cheek wiping the tears that had sprung forth soft murmurs urging him to do the right thing on his lips.      “Screw you.”  A sigh. “I really thought you would be smarter than that Sam oh well.”,2024-07-13 01:28:17 GMT

Well I probably won’t tag 10 people because I don’t have 10 people to tag 😬 but I’ll pass on the gifs! I wish I could do 10 for each show lol     1. Supernatural. I haven’t actually finished it to the end.. Although I read all about it and I’m not sure I will ever finish it. However I’ve watched almost to the end 8 million trillion times. As the story goes - if you want good plot and story do the first 5 seasons. Anything after that jumps the shark but it jumps it so WELL.     2. Doctor Who. another one where I haven’t kept up with the recent seasons. Right or wrong I just couldn’t grasp the doctor in Jodie although she’s a great actor. Tennant’s my doctor.           3. Downton Abbey. I even liked both movies lol        4. Andor. I really really really hope the second season is as good as the first 🤞🏻:     5. Friends. oh good Lord it’s gonna be hard to not fill this post with all the wonderful jokes. I’ve passed my love of this show on to my nieces and nephews and I’m so proud 😁     6. West Wing. OMG I can’t say enough about this show. I love it so much I’ve watched it so many times. It’s genius.     7. Run BTS. And all the other BTS shows. I love them all. OMG I love these guys so much. I can’t express it.     8. Stranger Things. The only show I’ve had a party to binge watch the newest season for. And I’m gonna do it again.     9. My Father Is Strange. I love this family so much. Except the oldest daughter’s mother in law.. whoever wrote this character has ABSOLUTELY had a narcissist in their life she was so perfectly maddening it was triggering. But not enough to keep me from watching the show over and over.     10. Coffee Prince. Oof.. a classic. ❤️,2024-07-13 02:54:42 GMT

147,Supernatural,['my bloody valentine'  'castiel'  'dean winchester'  'sam winchester'  'spn'  'spn fanart'],colorlessjay,Supernatural’s My Bloody Valentine  but it’s high school drama  Imagine this:   It’s valentine’s day and Sam’s baffled that his usually flirty charming and outgoing big brother is suddenly so closed off about it. What’s more interesting though is the amount of ugly breakups happening around school just days before Valentine’s.   Dean finding it suspicious takes the investigation as an excuse to bottle up some repressed feelings about the day. Whatever’s going on it’s about to go down today  &lt;!-- more --&gt; So the investigation begins as the two brother try to find the source of these nasty love quarrels. Along the way they find hints that the ‘Good Ones’ at student council (Angels and heaven) might have something to do with it so the brothers get their &#x27;spy on the inside angel’ friend Castiel to help.   Unfortunately it’s not who they thought it would be. And the further into the investigation the three got the more trouble they dug themselves into.   It leads to Castiel forming a weird love for chocolate (Something he’s never been allowed to have and now is easily distracted by). Sam having to ask help from Ruby a girl Sam broke up with and who Dean’s been trying to get Sam away from after she got expelled. And Dean having to unearth the crushing thoughts of his own loneliness and the fears of dying alone and loveless.,2024-07-13 10:42:04 GMT

Dean finding it suspicious takes the investigation as an excuse to bottle up some repressed feelings about the day.

Unfortunately it’s not who they thought it would be. And the further into the investigation the three got the more trouble they dug themselves into.   It leads to Castiel forming a weird love for chocolate (Something he’s never been allowed to have and now is easily distracted by). Sam having to ask help from Ruby a girl Sam broke up with and who Dean’s been trying to get Sam away from after she got expelled.

Boredom strikes the youngest in the household and since Y/N is growing up the Winchester boys have become her guinea pigs. What’s gonna happen when she convinces Sam Dean and Bobby to let her give them a makeover so they can too feel like ‘pretty princesses’.      Y/N is 9 years old Sam is 9 years old and Dean is 13 years old.     BASED ON:     The Old Testament Series.     Genesis Primis: A Supernatural Rewrite (Dean Winchester x Reader) by @dianawinchester03      💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄     &lt;!-- more --&gt;   Third Person POV        “Hey Uncle Bobby??” Y/N peered through the side of the door into Bobby’s living room. He was sat on the couch nursing a glass of whiskey. Sam and Dean were watching Looney Tunes on his crummy old TV. All heads turned to her “What’s up kiddo?” Bobby asked the little girl affectionately.     Y/N hid her makeup kit her daddy bought for her for Christmas behind her back a cheeky smile on her face.     A smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth at the look on her face. He couldn’t help but have a soft spot for the girl and he could tell that look meant she was up to no good. He leaned back in his chair and folded his hands in front of him watching her with a mixture of amusement and suspicion.     “What are you hiding there kiddo?” Bobby asked raising an eyebrow at her. “Can I do your makeup?” She asked them sweetly blinking her eyes slightly. A sweet smile spread across her face as she moved back and forth on her heels and toes. The color drained from Sam and Deans faces.     Both Sam and Dean’s heads snapped up at her request their eyes widening in a mix of horror and reluctance. They looked at each other helplessly before turning back to Bobby silently pleading for him to intervene.     Bobby chuckled at the reactions of the boys before turning his gaze back to Y/N. He stroked his beard for a moment contemplating the request. “Eh why not?” He said giving in with a shrug.     “Yayyy!!” She exclaimed excitedly running into the room. She ushered Bobby to the ground flat infront of the couch doing the same for the boys. “Now sit still I don’t want to poke your eyes out” She warns the Winchesters.      Bobby chuckled and perched himself in front of the couch trying to keep his face straight despite the amused twinkle in his eyes. He looked over at Sam and Dean who were both sitting on the couch looking like they were about to be tortured. Sam was tensing up while Dean was eyeing Y/N’s makeup kit skeptically.     “Great just what we need. Y/N/N turning us into doll faces” Dean muttered under his breath. “Watch it charming. Before &#x27;accidentally’ I smear lipstick on your eyes” She narrowed her eyes at her friend warningly. Unzipping the bag to get started on Bobby’s face.     Bobby couldn’t help but chuckle at Y/N’s sassy response. Reminding him a bit of her mother. Dean held up his hands in surrender trying to look serious but failing miserably. The corners of his mouth were betraying him threatening to break into a grin.     Meanwhile Sam was trying hard not to laugh at his brother who looked as if he was about to faint at the prospect of being turned into a &#x27;doll face’ by a y/n.         -        After she was done with Bobby’s face up she grinned proudly. The old man’s beard was now covered with black eyeshadow lips painted a rosy pink and his eye lids coated with messy purple dust. She then moved over to Sam. “Your turn” She smiled menacingly. Holding up the eyeshadow brush and lipstick.     Bobby’s face was a work of art a masterpiece of colorful chaos. He couldn’t help but laugh at the sight of himself in the mirror taking the good-natured teasing like a champ.     Sam on the other hand was looking like he would rather face a horde of demons than allow a his best friend to touch his face with that makeup brush.     His eyes widened as she turned her attention to him next a mixture of fear and resignation on his face. He glanced over at Bobby who had a look of amusement plastered all over his face clearly enjoying the boy’s predicament. Sam gulped and reluctantly sat in front of her. But he knew better than to argue so he reluctantly sat himself in front of her.     Dean on the other hand was having a field day. He was sitting on the couch watching Sam squirm with glee a huge grin on his face.         -        Sam’s look didn’t take too long she topped his mop head with a pretty pink bow to the side as the finishing touch. His eyelids sported an orange eyeshadow his lips smeared with the red lipstick. Sam’s face was now a canvas of colorful chaos courtesy of Y/N’s ‘artistic’ skills. He tried to look offended but the pink bow in his hair was ruining the effect.     She smiled proudly again before turning to Dean hands on her hips. “Ready charming?” Dean who had been watching Sam’s transformation with a mixture of horror and amusement was now dreading his turn. He looked at Y/N with a mix of fear and resignation knowing he was next in line for the makeup chair.     He put on a brave face trying to look like he was ready to face whatever Y/N was going to do to him. “Bring it princess”. He challenged. And boy did he regret it.     Y/N smirked at Dean’s challenge knowing full well that he should never have challenged her. She grabbed her kit and approached him a mischievous gleam in her eyes. She sat down in front of Dean eyeing his face with a critical eye.     He swallowed hard realising that he might have bitten off more than he could chew. But there was no backing out now and he knew it.        -        Within minutes Dean’s faces was transformed into exactly what he quoted earlier a doll face. His cheeks her compact with dark pink blush his eyelids coated with sparkly (emphasis on sparkly) light pink eyeshadow. His lips smeared with her brightest shade of pink lipstick. The teenage boy looked with he came straight out of a Barbie doll collection.      But it didn’t end there. Just like Sam she topped his head with a white bow before handing him the hand-held mirror.     Dean was stunned into silence as he looked at his reflection in the mirror. He then let out of the cartoonish scream his lungs could muster up. He looked like a character straight out of a Barbie movie a far cry from hunting monster and fighting for his life.     The pink eyeshadow and blush on his cheeks were so over the top it was almost comical and the bright pink lipstick on his lips made him look like a clown.     His brother Sam was trying his hardest not to burst out laughing. The look on Dean’s face was priceless a mixture of horror disbelief and a touch of &#x27;oh God why me?’.     Bobby meanwhile was having a hard time holding back his laughter. He had tears in his eyes as he tried to keep a neutral expression but the sight of Dean looking like a Barbie doll was almost too much to handle. He let out a snort of laughter before catching himself trying to maintain a serious facade.     “Oh man you look… interesting son” Bobby managed to say his voice cracking with held-back laughter. “Who’s the pretty princess now?” Y/N smiled widely a twinge of mischief but also victory on her face.     Sam couldn’t hold it in anymore. He burst into hysterical laughter falling back onto the couch holding his stomach as he laughed uncontrollably at the sight of his big brother looking like a Barbie doll.     Dean on the other hand was at a loss for words. His face was a mixture of anger embarrassment and shock. He looked like he wanted to retaliate but he couldn’t find a single way to defend his &#x27;pretty’ appearance.     Bobby was enjoying himself laughing heartily at the boys’ predicament. Dean scoffed “You two are just jealous I look prettier” He retorted sassily aiding to the act. Putting on a high pitched voice snapping his fingers in a ‘Z’ formation.     Sam’s laughter got even louder at Dean’s sassy response tears streaming down his face as he tried to catch his breath. Bobby on the other hand was nearly rolling on the floor laughing his face turning red.     Bobby was watching the scene unfold clearly enjoying the show. He had a smile on his face watching the banter between the three kids. He chuckled wiping away a tear from laughing so hard.     He was happy to know that even with everything these children had gone through and are still going through. They still found a way to make each other and him laugh.     “Well I’ll be damned you actually pull off princess look Dean” He teased watching the boys try to act like tough hunters while looking so pretty. “You’re darn straight Robert” Y/N sassed back earning a joking glare from her Uncle Bobby.     Dean rolled his eyes at Bobby’s comment trying to play it cool despite the embarrassment. He crossed his arms still maintaining the high-pitched voice and the sassy attitude. “Yeah yeah laugh it up you two. Just remember who can still kick your asses in this doll face.”     Sam was still giggling on the floor trying to catch his breath from laughing too hard. He wiped away the tears from his eyes and tried to get himself together. “Seriously man you’re like a Ken Doll come to life.”     The creaking of the front door opening caused them all to freeze in place eye wide with fear when in walked their fathers F/N L/N and John Winchester.     Their fathers stood in the doorway staring at the spectacle before them. There was silence in the room as both men took in the scene before them. Bobby Sam and Dean all froze unsure how to explain the situation.     John and F/N scanned the room their eyes falling on each person. Their gazes landed on the boys and they froze as they took in the sight of both Sam and Dean wearing makeup and bows in their hair.     “Daddy look I made everyone pretty” Y/N said excitedly running into her fathers arms.      Both fathers were stunned for a moment before they snapped out of it. John’s eyes were wide as saucers as he stared at his sons struggling to digest the sight in front of him. F/N on the other hand was holding back laughter trying to keep a straight face.     As Y/N ran into F/N’s arms he picked her up with a chuckle and held her close. “Yeah I can see that baby.” He replied the corners of his mouth twitching in amusement.      “What do you think Uncle John?” Y/N asked John feigning innocence while internally praying he wouldn’t burst into a fit of rage. She knew if she put on her puppy dog eyes with John he’d take it easier on the boys.     John’s eye twitched as he stared at the two boys his face a mixture of shock anger and disbelief. Sam and Dean tensed up waiting for the inevitable outburst from their grumpy dad. But then Y/N piped up feigning innocence and hitting John with her puppy dog eyes.     His face softened a bit the anger in his eyes replaced with a mixture of resignation and annoyance. As F/N shot his friend a warning glare not to yell at the kids or his little girl as they were only having fun.     “It’s… colorful” he said his voice strained as if he was trying hard to keep his cool.     Sam and Dean exchanged glances relieved that John hadn’t erupted into a fit of rage. But they were still bracing themselves expecting the worst. They knew John was old school and expected his sons to be tough masculine hunters.     Meanwhile Bobby chuckled internally knowing that John’s reaction could have been a hell of a lot worse. He watched the scene unfold enjoying the chaos.     A hint of a smile twitched on John’s face as he leaned down infront of his eldest son to get a better look “Is that glitter?” He couldn’t help but snort with a cocked eyebrow.     This made everyone burst out into laughter including F/N and himself as Dean’s face flushed with embarrassment.        💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄        Authors Note: I know I promised everyone a new chapter on Genesis Primis soon but I’m having so much fun with the prequel😂     This one was actually not my idea it was requested by @karrah89 so a big thanks to you love.

Read at your own risk. Oral three-some/ mention of four-some vulgar language   A/N: thank you so much for reading this is posted on AO3. I enjoyed writing this a lot so I hope you enjoy it as well. I recently started watching supernatural again and couldn’t help myself anyway ENJOY!!! 💕✨      It was an unusually slow night at the bar with only a handful of patrons scattered about nursing their drinks and chatting quietly. As the door swung open the bar’s calm atmosphere was shattered and my gaze was drawn to the trio like a magnet. The two men their suits a stark contrast to the casual attire of the other patrons exuded an air of confidence and authority. The taller man with his long hair and chiseled features seemed to embody the phrase “tall dark and handsome” while his companion sporting a Tex-turned-crew cut appeared more rugged and rough around the edges. The young woman dressed in a fitted dress that accentuated her curves trailed behind them with an air of quiet compliance. As they approached the bar their eyes scanned the room with an unspoken understanding as if they were on a mission.     My gave warm and welcoming smile before I asked “What can I get ya?” My hands moved on their own quickly whipping up a tequila shot and pushing it forward to the shorter man. His smirk was a mixture of amusement and mischief and I felt a shiver run down my spine as our eyes met.     “I’ll take a whiskey on the rocks.” He shot me a quick wink before slamming the empty shot glass down on its rim. I nodded grabbing a cup and filling it with ice before looking to the taller one.     As I poured the whiskey with a gentle flourish I turned to him with a sly smile my fingers drumming a tantalizing rhythm on the counter. “And what about you?” I purred my voice husky as I raised an eyebrow my free hand resting suggestively on my hip hoping my tight fitted clothes would draw him in closer. He gave me a slight uncomfortable look before glancing at their female companion who stood between them not exactly paying attention to me. I kept my flirtatious smile up but deep own I was hurt and taken aback by the look he gave me. Something was off with this one it only seemed to make me want him more. I’ll just have to up my game.     With a courteous tone “I’ll just have a draft” his eyebrows arching slightly as he did so his lips compressing into a subtle line. My eyes locked onto his my mind whirling with tantalizing thoughts as I looked him over again. I couldn’t help but bite my lip my thoughts conjuring up images of him in a different light – one that left me trembling with anticipation and my heart racing with excitement. My hand reached under the bar slightly bent over knowing my breast will definitely catch his interest. With a quick pull slightly bouncing I pop the bottle cap off and placed it in front of him. His gaze averted me before he turned around once more scanning the bar. I hid my frown turning to the petite woman but before my lips even parted she spoke up.       “I’ll take a shot whatever you prefer” she said her voice as smooth as honey yet devoid of any warmth or flirtation. Her words hung in the air and I noticed her gaze linger on me waiting for a response. Without thinking I crafted a buttery nipple and slid it across the bar to her. A faint furrow appeared on my brow as I turned away feeling an inexplicable tension in my chest. There was something unsettling about her something that piqued my curiosity. I’d met many people before effortlessly reading their emotions and intentions but this trio was different. I needed a breath of fresh air. I looked to my coworker giving him a quick way to take over the bar before I slipped out to the storage room then out the back door to the empty alley way.      I lit a cigarette and took a long drag savoring the bitter taste as I paused to inhale the toxins. The cool night air filled my lungs and I let out a slow exhale feeling the stress of the evening’s events begin to dissipate. As I stood in the alleyway lost in thought I shake everything off dropping the half cigarette and stepping it out. I made my way back inside deciding to take a chance on striking up a conversation.      “So you guys aren’t from around here are you?” I give my best smile watching the three. I noticed the paperwork spread out on the counter top of the bar as the woman began to quickly shuffle it back together into the folder she had.     “Uh no we aren’t.” The taller one gave another tight lipped smile placing his empty bottle in front of me. I quickly pop another one from him trading for the empty one.      “I see” the tension seemed to rise in my chest but they seemed as calm as daisies. “Well if you’re staying for a bit longer I’d love to show you around.” The shorter one seemed to chuckle lightly leaning on the bar a flirtatious smile playing on his lips.      “I’d love to” he paused waiting for me.      “Oh Amy.” I smile softly his eyes trailing me up and down.     “Amy.” He repeated softly that earned an elbow jab in his ribs. He hissed glancing at the women but the taller one hid his amusement by drinking his beer. “well I’m Dean and that’s my brother Sam.” He jesters to him and his brother while his other had loosened his tie like he hated wearing it. I raised a brow taking note that they were brothers I wouldn’t have guessed that. Dean opened his mouth but was cut off.      “I’m Y/N.” Her voice never changed from earlier. My brows raised slightly but quickly shaking the expression away. I study her a small moment while her gaze was fixed elsewhere. Her skin was flawless not a scar or pimple in sight long hair pulled in a tight pony tail curves of her body well accentuated by her dress. I couldn’t help the slight jealousy I had building up in my chest by looking at her. I finally shook the thoughts away pressing a smile.      “Well Sam Dean and Y/N” I began “If you need anything while in town you know where to find me.”      ———     I watched as the trio finished their drinks and left the bar and I couldn’t help but feel an unexplainable urge to follow them. I excused myself to my coworker claiming I needed to leave early and for him to close up without me. My mind racing with a growing sense of curiosity. Without being seen I slipped out of the bar and into my car the engine purring to life as I blended into the night. I kept a discreet distance my eyes fixed on the Impala as it led me to a rundown motel on the outskirts of town. As they pulled into the parking lot my brow furrowed once more. My curiosity was sparked by the unusual choice of a motel on the outskirts of town a place that seemed to be perpetually shrouded in a thin layer of neglect and disrepair.. The shorter man emerged from the vehicle his movements calculated as he unlocked the door to room 217. The other two followed their gazes scanning the area with an air of caution before disappearing into the dimly lit room. My eyes lingered on the door my mind whirling with questions. What were they doing here? And why did I feel an unshakeable sense of unease as I watched them disappear into the shadows?     I hesitated grappling with the conflicting thoughts racing through my mind. I knew I shouldn’t be here and I certainly shouldn’t have followed them but I had. I quietly closed my car door my footsteps silent as I crossed the parking lot to the opposite side of the motel. The forest loomed behind the motel a dark and foreboding presence. A light flickered on in one of the windows illuminating the room I assumed was theirs. I crept closer crouching low to peer through the glass. Dean sat on the bed’s edge flipping through channels on the TV while his brother hunched over his laptop at the table. My brow furrowed in confusion wondering where their female companion had vanished to. Just as I was pondering this the bathroom door swung open and she emerged her robe clutched tightly around her small frame. I ducked just in time holding my breath as she turned towards the window. My heart pounded in my chest like a drum my breaths coming in short gasps as I feared she might have seen me. I remained frozen for a few tense moments before slowly turning back to peer in my eyes widening and my mouth parted a small gasp. Y/N’s robe was off her body and she stood before Dean naked. I couldn’t believe what I was witnessing. Why is she naked in front of them both?      “What the fuck?” I let the words fall from my lips. Quickly I glance behind me seeing only the forest still standing silently. I turn slowly to look through the window my hands pressing to the brick of the shabby motel reminding me this is real what was happening right before my eyes was indeed real.     “Dean” she said her arms crossing over her breasts. A small smirk playing on Deans lips as he tossed the remote onto the other bed his attention fixed solely on her. Her expression clearly showed she was upset but I struggled to make sense of the situation. “Do you like her more?” she demanded. Dean’s gaze flicked to Sam who watched with an air of amusement his hands clasped together in a relaxed pose as he leaned back into his seat. My brow furrowed at Sam’s state of relaxation while Y/N stood there.      “Who?” Dean finally replied after a long pause then snapped his fingers “OOH! The woman on the tv?” He playfully teased going to reach out for her waist but she pulled away giving him a threatening glare that I could even feel through the glass. “The women at the bar?” He raised a brow still having that teasing smirk. I watched as Y/N just stared at him for a moment before slowly swaying her way to Sam who openly removed his clasped hands and letting her take a seat in his lap. His hands finding themselves resting under her breast and the other wrapped around her frame to grip her hip. I bite back a whimper my chest tightening seeing how large his hands were compared to any other mans. Just one hand engulfed her body a snippet of jealously filled my chest.     I watched as Sam nuzzled his face into the crook of her neck her lips parting and letting a soft moan escape them. He then pulled away slightly giving his brother a look before attacking her neck once more while his hand cupped her breast and the other gripped her hip tightly pulling her closer to his chest. Dean only tightened his jaw his adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed saliva. Y/N only continued to whimper and moan softly keeping steady eye contact with Dean. I couldn’t pull my eyes away while Sam only moved her to sit directly on his erection and spread her legs for dean to watch in silent pain. Sam’s long fingers found their way between her folds his middle and ring finger gently caressing her clit. I swallowed the salvia building up in the back of my throat. I felt like a creep watching him fondle her but I couldn’t tear my eyes away. At this point I was to invested and I had to admit aside form the jealousy I wanted to watch.     “Y/N” Deans voice pulled my attention to him. Sam stopped to see what his brother had to say. She eyed him sitting up purposely grinding herself against Sam to earn a grunt from the taller one. I could see the dying begging look from here Dean wanted her too. “I want you” He began again “only you.” His voice raspy and deep with a hint of pleading behind it as if he might even choke if she said no. She eyed him for a bit before lifting a finger curling it allowing him to come over. He stood hesitating before taking a few steps in front of them. Sam’s hands lifted towards her breasts once more cupping them while his finger and thumb pinched her nipples letting them roll between his fingers. Dean lowered himself between her legs one hand on her knee while his lips pressed to the other leaving a trail of kisses into her inner thigh. She gasped slightly at the soft touch of his tongue lightly dragging on her out folds teasing her before his tongue dove deeply into her. Another moan came from her louder than the last she went to close her legs on him but his hands held them apart. Sam grabbed her wrists in one hand and his other held her throat.      “Shh” Sam cooed in her ear “you’ll wake the neighbors.” He then tilted her head up so their lips met. Dean moaned into her his lips pulling away with a popping kiss his lips and chin glistening from the mixture of her wetness and his saliva.      “I love the way you taste.” The comment hung in the air while he leaned back down his tongue working faster to please her. Her hips bucking with the friction earning a throaty moan into Sam’s mouth who savored it with his own moan in response. Her leg lifted to push dean away his head tilted with a pleased smile. “All done?” He propped her foot on his shoulder holding her ankle.      She shook her head as her lips parted “I’m not even close.” A small smirk played across her lips. Dean and Sam shared a lustful look to each other Dean pulling her off his brother’s lap to connect their lips while Sam begins to remove his clothes. Sam pulls her away from Dean catching her lips deepening the kiss while Dean glared at his brother removing his own clothes. With swift motion dean stood behind Y/N kissing the side of her neck and shoulder his hands finding their way to her breast. Sam continued to kiss her stealing every moan and breath that escaped her. I finally looked away in disbelief pressing my back to the cold brick wall of the motel. Their voices echoed through the window each moan sending a shiver down my spine. A loud “yes” and “oh god” from Y/N brought me to look back through the glass. My lids couldn’t get any wider Sam leaning against the wall held Y/N just by her thighs her legs spread apart while dean stood between her. His hands gripped her thighs just below Sam’s larger ones. My eye stuck on their cocks slowly moving in an out of her the way her chest arched and her eyes rolled back. A ghostly feeling ran through the lower parts of my body as if I could feel it the pain and pleasure being received by the brothers.     “I guess they startd without me.” A rugged raspy voice followed by the swooshing of wind startled a yelp out of me throwing myself away from the window to fall on my butt. My eyes darted to a man in a trench coat who only watched through the window the erection clearly showing in his pants. I continued to blink looking to him when he finally laid his eyes on me. I sat there shaking seen as I had been found by this man who appeared from no where. He approached me my heart beating loud by how close he knelt down before me. He raised a hand two fingers pressed to my forehead “Goodnight.” Was the last thing I heard my eyes fluttering close and the cold grass caught me.,2024-07-13 18:06:45 GMT

Boredom strikes the youngest in the household and since Y/N is growing up the Winchester boys have become her guinea pigs. What’s gonna happen when she convinces Sam Dean and Bobby to let her give them a makeover so they can too feel like ‘pretty princesses’.      Y/N is 9 years old Sam is 9 years old and Dean is 13 years old.     BASED ON:     The Old Testament Series.     Genesis Primis: A Supernatural Rewrite (Dean Winchester x Reader) by @dianawinchester03      💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄     &lt;!-- more --&gt;   Third Person POV        “Hey Uncle Bobby??” Y/N peered through the side of the door into Bobby’s living room. He was sat on the couch nursing a glass of whiskey. Sam and Dean were watching Looney Tunes on his crummy old TV. All heads turned to her “What’s up kiddo?” Bobby asked the little girl affectionately.     Y/N hid her makeup kit her daddy bought for her for Christmas behind her back a cheeky smile on her face.     A smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth at the look on her face. He couldn’t help but have a soft spot for the girl and he could tell that look meant she was up to no good. He leaned back in his chair and folded his hands in front of him watching her with a mixture of amusement and suspicion.     “What are you hiding there kiddo?” Bobby asked raising an eyebrow at her. “Can I do your makeup?” She asked them sweetly blinking her eyes slightly. A sweet smile spread across her face as she moved back and forth on her heels and toes. The color drained from Sam and Deans faces.     Both Sam and Dean’s heads snapped up at her request their eyes widening in a mix of horror and reluctance. They looked at each other helplessly before turning back to Bobby silently pleading for him to intervene.     Bobby chuckled at the reactions of the boys before turning his gaze back to Y/N. He stroked his beard for a moment contemplating the request. “Eh why not?” He said giving in with a shrug.     “Yayyy!!” She exclaimed excitedly running into the room. She ushered Bobby to the ground flat infront of the couch doing the same for the boys. “Now sit still I don’t want to poke your eyes out” She warns the Winchesters.      Bobby chuckled and perched himself in front of the couch trying to keep his face straight despite the amused twinkle in his eyes. He looked over at Sam and Dean who were both sitting on the couch looking like they were about to be tortured. Sam was tensing up while Dean was eyeing Y/N’s makeup kit skeptically.     “Great just what we need. Y/N/N turning us into doll faces” Dean muttered under his breath. “Watch it charming. Before &#x27;accidentally’ I smear lipstick on your eyes” She narrowed her eyes at her friend warningly. Unzipping the bag to get started on Bobby’s face.     Bobby couldn’t help but chuckle at Y/N’s sassy response. Reminding him a bit of her mother. Dean held up his hands in surrender trying to look serious but failing miserably. The corners of his mouth were betraying him threatening to break into a grin.     Meanwhile Sam was trying hard not to laugh at his brother who looked as if he was about to faint at the prospect of being turned into a &#x27;doll face’ by a y/n.         -        After she was done with Bobby’s face up she grinned proudly. The old man’s beard was now covered with black eyeshadow lips painted a rosy pink and his eye lids coated with messy purple dust. She then moved over to Sam. “Your turn” She smiled menacingly. Holding up the eyeshadow brush and lipstick.     Bobby’s face was a work of art a masterpiece of colorful chaos. He couldn’t help but laugh at the sight of himself in the mirror taking the good-natured teasing like a champ.     Sam on the other hand was looking like he would rather face a horde of demons than allow a his best friend to touch his face with that makeup brush.     His eyes widened as she turned her attention to him next a mixture of fear and resignation on his face. He glanced over at Bobby who had a look of amusement plastered all over his face clearly enjoying the boy’s predicament. Sam gulped and reluctantly sat in front of her. But he knew better than to argue so he reluctantly sat himself in front of her.     Dean on the other hand was having a field day. He was sitting on the couch watching Sam squirm with glee a huge grin on his face.         -        Sam’s look didn’t take too long she topped his mop head with a pretty pink bow to the side as the finishing touch. His eyelids sported an orange eyeshadow his lips smeared with the red lipstick. Sam’s face was now a canvas of colorful chaos courtesy of Y/N’s ‘artistic’ skills. He tried to look offended but the pink bow in his hair was ruining the effect.     She smiled proudly again before turning to Dean hands on her hips. “Ready charming?” Dean who had been watching Sam’s transformation with a mixture of horror and amusement was now dreading his turn. He looked at Y/N with a mix of fear and resignation knowing he was next in line for the makeup chair.     He put on a brave face trying to look like he was ready to face whatever Y/N was going to do to him. “Bring it princess”. He challenged. And boy did he regret it.     Y/N smirked at Dean’s challenge knowing full well that he should never have challenged her. She grabbed her kit and approached him a mischievous gleam in her eyes. She sat down in front of Dean eyeing his face with a critical eye.     He swallowed hard realising that he might have bitten off more than he could chew. But there was no backing out now and he knew it.        -        Within minutes Dean’s faces was transformed into exactly what he quoted earlier a doll face. His cheeks her compact with dark pink blush his eyelids coated with sparkly (emphasis on sparkly) light pink eyeshadow. His lips smeared with her brightest shade of pink lipstick. The teenage boy looked with he came straight out of a Barbie doll collection.      But it didn’t end there. Just like Sam she topped his head with a white bow before handing him the hand-held mirror.     Dean was stunned into silence as he looked at his reflection in the mirror. He then let out of the cartoonish scream his lungs could muster up. He looked like a character straight out of a Barbie movie a far cry from hunting monster and fighting for his life.     The pink eyeshadow and blush on his cheeks were so over the top it was almost comical and the bright pink lipstick on his lips made him look like a clown.     His brother Sam was trying his hardest not to burst out laughing. The look on Dean’s face was priceless a mixture of horror disbelief and a touch of &#x27;oh God why me?’.     Bobby meanwhile was having a hard time holding back his laughter. He had tears in his eyes as he tried to keep a neutral expression but the sight of Dean looking like a Barbie doll was almost too much to handle. He let out a snort of laughter before catching himself trying to maintain a serious facade.     “Oh man you look… interesting son” Bobby managed to say his voice cracking with held-back laughter. “Who’s the pretty princess now?” Y/N smiled widely a twinge of mischief but also victory on her face.     Sam couldn’t hold it in anymore. He burst into hysterical laughter falling back onto the couch holding his stomach as he laughed uncontrollably at the sight of his big brother looking like a Barbie doll.     Dean on the other hand was at a loss for words. His face was a mixture of anger embarrassment and shock. He looked like he wanted to retaliate but he couldn’t find a single way to defend his &#x27;pretty’ appearance.     Bobby was enjoying himself laughing heartily at the boys’ predicament. Dean scoffed “You two are just jealous I look prettier” He retorted sassily aiding to the act. Putting on a high pitched voice snapping his fingers in a ‘Z’ formation.     Sam’s laughter got even louder at Dean’s sassy response tears streaming down his face as he tried to catch his breath. Bobby on the other hand was nearly rolling on the floor laughing his face turning red.     Bobby was watching the scene unfold clearly enjoying the show. He had a smile on his face watching the banter between the three kids. He chuckled wiping away a tear from laughing so hard.     He was happy to know that even with everything these children had gone through and are still going through. They still found a way to make each other and him laugh.     “Well I’ll be damned you actually pull off princess look Dean” He teased watching the boys try to act like tough hunters while looking so pretty. “You’re darn straight Robert” Y/N sassed back earning a joking glare from her Uncle Bobby.     Dean rolled his eyes at Bobby’s comment trying to play it cool despite the embarrassment. He crossed his arms still maintaining the high-pitched voice and the sassy attitude. “Yeah yeah laugh it up you two. Just remember who can still kick your asses in this doll face.”     Sam was still giggling on the floor trying to catch his breath from laughing too hard. He wiped away the tears from his eyes and tried to get himself together. “Seriously man you’re like a Ken Doll come to life.”     The creaking of the front door opening caused them all to freeze in place eye wide with fear when in walked their fathers F/N L/N and John Winchester.     Their fathers stood in the doorway staring at the spectacle before them. There was silence in the room as both men took in the scene before them. Bobby Sam and Dean all froze unsure how to explain the situation.     John and F/N scanned the room their eyes falling on each person. Their gazes landed on the boys and they froze as they took in the sight of both Sam and Dean wearing makeup and bows in their hair.     “Daddy look I made everyone pretty” Y/N said excitedly running into her fathers arms.      Both fathers were stunned for a moment before they snapped out of it. John’s eyes were wide as saucers as he stared at his sons struggling to digest the sight in front of him. F/N on the other hand was holding back laughter trying to keep a straight face.     As Y/N ran into F/N’s arms he picked her up with a chuckle and held her close. “Yeah I can see that baby.” He replied the corners of his mouth twitching in amusement.      “What do you think Uncle John?” Y/N asked John feigning innocence while internally praying he wouldn’t burst into a fit of rage. She knew if she put on her puppy dog eyes with John he’d take it easier on the boys.     John’s eye twitched as he stared at the two boys his face a mixture of shock anger and disbelief. Sam and Dean tensed up waiting for the inevitable outburst from their grumpy dad. But then Y/N piped up feigning innocence and hitting John with her puppy dog eyes.     His face softened a bit the anger in his eyes replaced with a mixture of resignation and annoyance. As F/N shot his friend a warning glare not to yell at the kids or his little girl as they were only having fun.     “It’s… colorful” he said his voice strained as if he was trying hard to keep his cool.     Sam and Dean exchanged glances relieved that John hadn’t erupted into a fit of rage. But they were still bracing themselves expecting the worst. They knew John was old school and expected his sons to be tough masculine hunters.     Meanwhile Bobby chuckled internally knowing that John’s reaction could have been a hell of a lot worse. He watched the scene unfold enjoying the chaos.     A hint of a smile twitched on John’s face as he leaned down infront of his eldest son to get a better look “Is that glitter?” He couldn’t help but snort with a cocked eyebrow.     This made everyone burst out into laughter including F/N and himself as Dean’s face flushed with embarrassment.        💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄        Authors Note: I know I promised everyone a new chapter on Genesis Primis soon but I’m having so much fun with the prequel😂     This one was actually not my idea it was requested by @karrah89 so a big thanks to you love.

Read at your own risk. Oral three-some/ mention of four-some vulgar language   A/N: thank you so much for reading this is posted on AO3. I enjoyed writing this a lot so I hope you enjoy it as well. I recently started watching supernatural again and couldn’t help myself anyway ENJOY!!! 💕✨      It was an unusually slow night at the bar with only a handful of patrons scattered about nursing their drinks and chatting quietly. As the door swung open the bar’s calm atmosphere was shattered and my gaze was drawn to the trio like a magnet. The two men their suits a stark contrast to the casual attire of the other patrons exuded an air of confidence and authority. The taller man with his long hair and chiseled features seemed to embody the phrase “tall dark and handsome” while his companion sporting a Tex-turned-crew cut appeared more rugged and rough around the edges. The young woman dressed in a fitted dress that accentuated her curves trailed behind them with an air of quiet compliance. As they approached the bar their eyes scanned the room with an unspoken understanding as if they were on a mission.     My gave warm and welcoming smile before I asked “What can I get ya?” My hands moved on their own quickly whipping up a tequila shot and pushing it forward to the shorter man. His smirk was a mixture of amusement and mischief and I felt a shiver run down my spine as our eyes met.     “I’ll take a whiskey on the rocks.” He shot me a quick wink before slamming the empty shot glass down on its rim. I nodded grabbing a cup and filling it with ice before looking to the taller one.     As I poured the whiskey with a gentle flourish I turned to him with a sly smile my fingers drumming a tantalizing rhythm on the counter. “And what about you?” I purred my voice husky as I raised an eyebrow my free hand resting suggestively on my hip hoping my tight fitted clothes would draw him in closer. He gave me a slight uncomfortable look before glancing at their female companion who stood between them not exactly paying attention to me. I kept my flirtatious smile up but deep own I was hurt and taken aback by the look he gave me. Something was off with this one it only seemed to make me want him more. I’ll just have to up my game.     With a courteous tone “I’ll just have a draft” his eyebrows arching slightly as he did so his lips compressing into a subtle line. My eyes locked onto his my mind whirling with tantalizing thoughts as I looked him over again. I couldn’t help but bite my lip my thoughts conjuring up images of him in a different light – one that left me trembling with anticipation and my heart racing with excitement. My hand reached under the bar slightly bent over knowing my breast will definitely catch his interest. With a quick pull slightly bouncing I pop the bottle cap off and placed it in front of him. His gaze averted me before he turned around once more scanning the bar. I hid my frown turning to the petite woman but before my lips even parted she spoke up.       “I’ll take a shot whatever you prefer” she said her voice as smooth as honey yet devoid of any warmth or flirtation. Her words hung in the air and I noticed her gaze linger on me waiting for a response. Without thinking I crafted a buttery nipple and slid it across the bar to her. A faint furrow appeared on my brow as I turned away feeling an inexplicable tension in my chest. There was something unsettling about her something that piqued my curiosity. I’d met many people before effortlessly reading their emotions and intentions but this trio was different. I needed a breath of fresh air. I looked to my coworker giving him a quick way to take over the bar before I slipped out to the storage room then out the back door to the empty alley way.      I lit a cigarette and took a long drag savoring the bitter taste as I paused to inhale the toxins. The cool night air filled my lungs and I let out a slow exhale feeling the stress of the evening’s events begin to dissipate. As I stood in the alleyway lost in thought I shake everything off dropping the half cigarette and stepping it out. I made my way back inside deciding to take a chance on striking up a conversation.      “So you guys aren’t from around here are you?” I give my best smile watching the three. I noticed the paperwork spread out on the counter top of the bar as the woman began to quickly shuffle it back together into the folder she had.     “Uh no we aren’t.” The taller one gave another tight lipped smile placing his empty bottle in front of me. I quickly pop another one from him trading for the empty one.      “I see” the tension seemed to rise in my chest but they seemed as calm as daisies. “Well if you’re staying for a bit longer I’d love to show you around.” The shorter one seemed to chuckle lightly leaning on the bar a flirtatious smile playing on his lips.      “I’d love to” he paused waiting for me.      “Oh Amy.” I smile softly his eyes trailing me up and down.     “Amy.” He repeated softly that earned an elbow jab in his ribs. He hissed glancing at the women but the taller one hid his amusement by drinking his beer. “well I’m Dean and that’s my brother Sam.” He jesters to him and his brother while his other had loosened his tie like he hated wearing it. I raised a brow taking note that they were brothers I wouldn’t have guessed that. Dean opened his mouth but was cut off.      “I’m Y/N.” Her voice never changed from earlier. My brows raised slightly but quickly shaking the expression away. I study her a small moment while her gaze was fixed elsewhere. Her skin was flawless not a scar or pimple in sight long hair pulled in a tight pony tail curves of her body well accentuated by her dress. I couldn’t help the slight jealousy I had building up in my chest by looking at her. I finally shook the thoughts away pressing a smile.      “Well Sam Dean and Y/N” I began “If you need anything while in town you know where to find me.”      ———     I watched as the trio finished their drinks and left the bar and I couldn’t help but feel an unexplainable urge to follow them. I excused myself to my coworker claiming I needed to leave early and for him to close up without me. My mind racing with a growing sense of curiosity. Without being seen I slipped out of the bar and into my car the engine purring to life as I blended into the night. I kept a discreet distance my eyes fixed on the Impala as it led me to a rundown motel on the outskirts of town. As they pulled into the parking lot my brow furrowed once more. My curiosity was sparked by the unusual choice of a motel on the outskirts of town a place that seemed to be perpetually shrouded in a thin layer of neglect and disrepair.. The shorter man emerged from the vehicle his movements calculated as he unlocked the door to room 217. The other two followed their gazes scanning the area with an air of caution before disappearing into the dimly lit room. My eyes lingered on the door my mind whirling with questions. What were they doing here? And why did I feel an unshakeable sense of unease as I watched them disappear into the shadows?     I hesitated grappling with the conflicting thoughts racing through my mind. I knew I shouldn’t be here and I certainly shouldn’t have followed them but I had. I quietly closed my car door my footsteps silent as I crossed the parking lot to the opposite side of the motel. The forest loomed behind the motel a dark and foreboding presence. A light flickered on in one of the windows illuminating the room I assumed was theirs. I crept closer crouching low to peer through the glass. Dean sat on the bed’s edge flipping through channels on the TV while his brother hunched over his laptop at the table. My brow furrowed in confusion wondering where their female companion had vanished to. Just as I was pondering this the bathroom door swung open and she emerged her robe clutched tightly around her small frame. I ducked just in time holding my breath as she turned towards the window. My heart pounded in my chest like a drum my breaths coming in short gasps as I feared she might have seen me. I remained frozen for a few tense moments before slowly turning back to peer in my eyes widening and my mouth parted a small gasp. Y/N’s robe was off her body and she stood before Dean naked. I couldn’t believe what I was witnessing. Why is she naked in front of them both?      “What the fuck?” I let the words fall from my lips. Quickly I glance behind me seeing only the forest still standing silently. I turn slowly to look through the window my hands pressing to the brick of the shabby motel reminding me this is real what was happening right before my eyes was indeed real.     “Dean” she said her arms crossing over her breasts. A small smirk playing on Deans lips as he tossed the remote onto the other bed his attention fixed solely on her. Her expression clearly showed she was upset but I struggled to make sense of the situation. “Do you like her more?” she demanded. Dean’s gaze flicked to Sam who watched with an air of amusement his hands clasped together in a relaxed pose as he leaned back into his seat. My brow furrowed at Sam’s state of relaxation while Y/N stood there.      “Who?” Dean finally replied after a long pause then snapped his fingers “OOH! The woman on the tv?” He playfully teased going to reach out for her waist but she pulled away giving him a threatening glare that I could even feel through the glass. “The women at the bar?” He raised a brow still having that teasing smirk. I watched as Y/N just stared at him for a moment before slowly swaying her way to Sam who openly removed his clasped hands and letting her take a seat in his lap. His hands finding themselves resting under her breast and the other wrapped around her frame to grip her hip. I bite back a whimper my chest tightening seeing how large his hands were compared to any other mans. Just one hand engulfed her body a snippet of jealously filled my chest.     I watched as Sam nuzzled his face into the crook of her neck her lips parting and letting a soft moan escape them. He then pulled away slightly giving his brother a look before attacking her neck once more while his hand cupped her breast and the other gripped her hip tightly pulling her closer to his chest. Dean only tightened his jaw his adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed saliva. Y/N only continued to whimper and moan softly keeping steady eye contact with Dean. I couldn’t pull my eyes away while Sam only moved her to sit directly on his erection and spread her legs for dean to watch in silent pain. Sam’s long fingers found their way between her folds his middle and ring finger gently caressing her clit. I swallowed the salvia building up in the back of my throat. I felt like a creep watching him fondle her but I couldn’t tear my eyes away. At this point I was to invested and I had to admit aside form the jealousy I wanted to watch.     “Y/N” Deans voice pulled my attention to him. Sam stopped to see what his brother had to say. She eyed him sitting up purposely grinding herself against Sam to earn a grunt from the taller one. I could see the dying begging look from here Dean wanted her too. “I want you” He began again “only you.” His voice raspy and deep with a hint of pleading behind it as if he might even choke if she said no. She eyed him for a bit before lifting a finger curling it allowing him to come over. He stood hesitating before taking a few steps in front of them. Sam’s hands lifted towards her breasts once more cupping them while his finger and thumb pinched her nipples letting them roll between his fingers. Dean lowered himself between her legs one hand on her knee while his lips pressed to the other leaving a trail of kisses into her inner thigh. She gasped slightly at the soft touch of his tongue lightly dragging on her out folds teasing her before his tongue dove deeply into her. Another moan came from her louder than the last she went to close her legs on him but his hands held them apart. Sam grabbed her wrists in one hand and his other held her throat.      “Shh” Sam cooed in her ear “you’ll wake the neighbors.” He then tilted her head up so their lips met. Dean moaned into her his lips pulling away with a popping kiss his lips and chin glistening from the mixture of her wetness and his saliva.      “I love the way you taste.” The comment hung in the air while he leaned back down his tongue working faster to please her. Her hips bucking with the friction earning a throaty moan into Sam’s mouth who savored it with his own moan in response. Her leg lifted to push dean away his head tilted with a pleased smile. “All done?” He propped her foot on his shoulder holding her ankle.      She shook her head as her lips parted “I’m not even close.” A small smirk played across her lips. Dean and Sam shared a lustful look to each other Dean pulling her off his brother’s lap to connect their lips while Sam begins to remove his clothes. Sam pulls her away from Dean catching her lips deepening the kiss while Dean glared at his brother removing his own clothes. With swift motion dean stood behind Y/N kissing the side of her neck and shoulder his hands finding their way to her breast. Sam continued to kiss her stealing every moan and breath that escaped her. I finally looked away in disbelief pressing my back to the cold brick wall of the motel. Their voices echoed through the window each moan sending a shiver down my spine. A loud “yes” and “oh god” from Y/N brought me to look back through the glass. My lids couldn’t get any wider Sam leaning against the wall held Y/N just by her thighs her legs spread apart while dean stood between her. His hands gripped her thighs just below Sam’s larger ones. My eye stuck on their cocks slowly moving in an out of her the way her chest arched and her eyes rolled back. A ghostly feeling ran through the lower parts of my body as if I could feel it the pain and pleasure being received by the brothers.     “I guess they startd without me.” A rugged raspy voice followed by the swooshing of wind startled a yelp out of me throwing myself away from the window to fall on my butt. My eyes darted to a man in a trench coat who only watched through the window the erection clearly showing in his pants. I continued to blink looking to him when he finally laid his eyes on me. I sat there shaking seen as I had been found by this man who appeared from no where. He approached me my heart beating loud by how close he knelt down before me. He raised a hand two fingers pressed to my forehead “Goodnight.” Was the last thing I heard my eyes fluttering close and the cold grass caught me.,2024-07-13 18:06:45 GMT

The lights are off and the house is locked up much to his disappointment. He can’t explain the urge he has to see you again it’s a need that has nothing to do with purpose and everything to do with desire.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Where is she? He asks Dean but the other man remains stubbornly silent.  He’s been this way since the two of you shared a moment in that field in Mill’s Park. Quiet reclusive. Michael thinks seeing you in that state hurt the other man in a way the Archangel can’t comprehend. He wants to though he wants to understand the emotions Dean feels when he’s with you he wants to experience them.  He spends ten minutes surveying the outside of your house taking in the nuances that personalise it. You have a wildflower wreath on the door that Dean helped you make in the fall last year and rose bushes that were planted long before you were a twinkle in your Papa’s eye. He runs his fingers over the velvet petals before he plucks one and carries it with him inside the house.  There’s been changes since Dean was last here over Christmas. A new rug underneath the oak coffee table a fresh pitcher of yellow tulips in the kitchen he set the rose down amongst them before he heads into the kitchen to rifles through the cupboards. He takes out your favourite mug before filling up the kettle in order to make coffee. It’s as he’s waiting for it to boil that he sees the calendar attached to the fridge the one you leave there for Dean so he knows where you are on the occasions he turns up.  Fire Tower is written under today’s date. It appears you’ll be there for several days.  He feels a pang then somewhere in his chest and he realises in some sort of odd sort of way that he misses you. He considers making an appearance but he knows instinctively that his presence will wreak havoc up there it’s best to leave that alone for now.  It doesn’t take long for him to find himself in your bedroom. His eyes fixate on the bed and he reaches for Dean’s memories only for a door to slam shut in his head.  They’re not for you his captive snaps and he wants to laugh because really Dean has no choice in the matter but he still can’t help resisting. It becomes a tug of war between the two of them each yank of the door becoming more desperate more violent until Michael tires of the game and completely obliterates the damn thing.  The memories they all come spilling out then scattering across his mind like pictures before they form into videos and then suddenly he’s right there face buried in the curve of your throat as he fucks you from behind and the things he’s saying to you…  They’re enough to make an Archangel blush.  Dean tries to snatch them back but it’s too late because Michael’s already moving onto the next one and the next one experiencing them in a raw maddening rush of euphoria and ecstasy.  Is this what it feels like for you? He asks Dean. Is this what it feels like to fall in love?  But the other man’s retreated again and Michael can feel his anguish vibrating through his mind as he begins to search through the drawers of your dresser eager to learn more about your tastes. His fingertips brush across a pair of dark mauve panties and he’s thrown back into another memory.  His mouth ghosting over the underwear the press of the material against his tongue as you hit that high your taste flooding his senses.  Before he even knows what he’s doing he’s half naked tangled up in your sheets his face pressed into your pillow inhaling the scent of sunshine and gardenias that clings to your skin. His pants have been shoved down his hips and he’s fucking those panties like he’s inside your wet cunt as another of Dean’s memories overtake him.  “Christ you feel so good baby.” He whispers his palm coming to rest on your throat squeezing just a little and your breath hitches as you tighten around him. “Gonna come for me aren’t you? That’s it honey I’m right here with you.”  Michael climaxes into his hand silver streaks staining those pretty panties as he spills his release into them. He stays there like that gripping them in his fist as he stretches out amongst your sheets. His entire body relaxes and the sensation of being surrounded by you lulls him into a drowsy sated state.  Is this what it’s like? He asks Dean again.  And once again Dean he refuses to answer.  Love Dean? Don’t miss any of his stories by joining the taglist here.  Interested in supporting me?

He won’t fire me.”  “But he won’t be thrilled that on our first night living together you slept in” I pointed out.  His smile faded a troubled look crossing his face as he stared at the ceiling. Sitting up I asked “You haven’t told him we moved in together?”  Dean sat up taking my hand. “No. Why bother? He doesn’t support us.”  I sighed worrying about Dean’s relationship with his father. “Dean I want you to have a good relationship with your dad.”  “Our relationship is complicated Y/N” he admitted squeezing my hand. “It has nothing to do with you or us.”  Bullshit.“ I whispered.   I knew I was overreacting but the thought that I might be ruining lives weighed heavily on me. All I wanted was for Dean to feel loved especially since it was clear he wasn’t getting that from his dad. Dean clearly looked up to him and I hated that my presence seemed to prevent him from feeling that pride.  &quot;Was the fight in the office the first fight you had about me or was there another before?” I asked gently.  He sighed wiping his face. “Before. The day I dropped off the car after the Andrew incident.”  I sighed heavily and buried my head in my hands. “What was the fight about?”  He sighed too drawing closer and taking my hand in his. “Y/N… You really don’t need to hear this. It’s only going to make you feel worse.”  Shaking my head I met his gaze directly. “No I need to know.”  “Okay…” He hesitated before continuing. “It was because Andrew was supposed to interview my dad but after the motel incident we lost the opportunity. My dad was furious that I got involved in the drama between you and Andrew…”  I nodded slowly squeezing his hand in reassurance.   Then a memory flashed through my mind: our first date when I noticed a cut on his lip and a bruise on his cheek. He hadn’t had those injuries before he dropped off the car.   Memories flooded back—Dean’s bruises on our first date. My heart raced. “Dean those bruises… were they from your dad?”  He swallowed hard his head bowing slightly. “Yeah.”  My heart shattered as panic rushed within me. He had been hurt because of me and that thought was unbearable especially after what happened with Andrew.  “No no… Sweetheart please breathe” he urged gently.  Tears welled up in my eyes. “I-I can’t believe I did this to you…”  His expression fell pained. “You did nothing to me sweetheart. It wasn’t you. My dad and I have had our differences for a long time and it’s not the first time things have turned physical.”  I wanted to hear him to take in the words he was saying but all I could see was flashes from my past every time Andrew told me it was my fault this was happening now that Dean was the one getting hit I believed it. It was my fault.  “Y-Yes but for him to hit you… because of me… I can&#x27;t…” I gasped for air feeling like my chest was tightening my ears ringing.   I collapsed to the floor and Dean quickly followed pulling me onto his lap. “Whoa wait no Y/N breathe!”   I looked up into his eyes seeing concern and pity and I despised it. I hated feeling so reliant like such a burden.   His hand moved soothingly up and down my back his gaze locked onto mine as he took slow deep breaths silently urging me to follow suit. Without thinking I mirrored his breathing feeling the tension ease and the air flow back into my lungs.  He sighed with relief and then gently rested his chin on my head. “Sweetheart I want you to know that it wasn’t your fault. I wouldn’t change a thing. Did I like that John hit me? No but it’s not the first time and won’t be the last. It has nothing to do with you. He’s just a jerk when he doesn’t get his way.”  I nodded wiping my eyes. “I wish things were different for you. I wish he didn’t hurt you.”  Dean swallowed hard his face becoming serious as he composed himself. When I looked into his eyes I saw tears forming. “Dean?”  “This is the first time I’ve really talked about John… my dad hitting me. And it’s the first time someone has cared enough to wish it was different. Usually people just tell me to toughen up and deal with it but they don’t know about the hitting.”  I held him tighter. “However you handle it you’re still a man. It’s okay to be hurt by it. It’s okay to hate him for it. It’s okay to not be okay.”  He nodded kissing my head gratefully. “Thank you. Do you feel any better?”  “A little. I’m sorry I freaked out…”  He shook his head helping me to stand a reassuring smile on his face. “I understand sweetheart. Fists violence abuse—it’s a trigger. If it’s happening to someone close to you it can cause panic. Don’t apologize… and thank you again for what you said.”  I kissed him gently and hugged him close. “Now you really should get ready before you get into trouble.”  He winked heading to the bathroom to dress. It only took a few minutes for him to get ready and grab his lunch before kissing me goodbye and leaving.  Alone I sighed deeply. I did feel somewhat relieved but I couldn’t shake the discomfort of how violence seemed to be a common response in our town. Where had communication and understanding gone? Where was the compassion?  The day dragged on slowly. I cleaned the entire apartment and searched for jobs without any success. I updated my resume and watched TV and it wasn’t even evening yet. Dean wouldn’t be off work for a few hours and I knew I had to do something before I went stir-crazy being alone here.  I quickly got dressed and headed to my car. I figured I might as well pick up dinner or do some shopping—anything to pass the time. Just as I was about to start the car my phone rang in the cup holder. I frowned at the unknown number flashing on the screen but I answered it anyway.  “Hello?”  The voice hesitated before speaking. “Hello.. Is this Y/N?”  I froze recognizing the voice and anxiety began to creep in. It was John.I tried to keep the shake out of my voice   “Um yeah it’s me. Is this John?”  “Yeah. I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment. Can we meet up?”  “Uh sure. Do you want me to come to the shop?”  There was a brief silence making me even more nervous.  “No I’d rather not involve Dean in this and you know how he gets when he’s protective.”  “Got it… Okay how about the coffee place around the corner?”  “Sounds good. See you in about 10 minutes.”  I hunt up the phone and took a deep breath wondering why John wanted to meet in person. Did Dean tell him we were living together? Was he going to confront me about something?  The uncertainty made me drive quickly spotting him already seated inside the coffee shop. I put on my best poker face and walked inside greeting him with a gentle smile. He returned the smile but I could tell he was a little uneasy about this meeting as he motioned for me to sit across him from in the booth.  As I sat down the air thickened with awkwardness and my nerves began to rise.  “So I just wanted to apologize for how I spoke to you the first time we met. I hope you understood where I was coming from” John started.  I nodded. “Yeah and I’m sorry I haven’t left Dean. I couldn’t.”  He raised his hand reassuringly. “No don’t. Dean told me about you guys moving in together this morning and I’m happy for you guys. I don’t get it but I’m happy. But I do have a huge favour to ask.”  I nodded for him to continue my anxiety growing.  “Andrew has been ignoring my calls but I finally got through to him when I mentioned that you were dating Dean” John explained.  My heart sank as fear gripped me.  “He said he’ll agree to do the interview the review the news segment but only if you’re willing to talk to him. Just one conversation with him for closure” John continued.  I froze. Why did Andrew want to talk to me? Did he actually want closure? Naturally I wanted to refuse to tell Andrew off. But here was Dean’s father asking me for a favour. This could be my chance to prove I’m a good person.  “Now I know that’s a lot to ask but—” John began but I cut him off.  “I’ll do it” I said firmly.  He looked surprised. “Really?”  “Yeah. You’re right it’s good for your business and this drama between me and Andrew has nothing to do with you. If talking to him is the only way to clear things up and help you out then I’ll do it.”  John stood up moved to my side of the booth and pulled me into an unexpected hug. I laughed and hugged him back. It felt good to be appreciated even though the thought of facing Andrew made my heart race.  After saying our goodbyes I left the diner and pulled out my phone dialing the familiar number that always made me cringe.  “Hello Y/N.” Andrew spoke knowingly.  “Hi Andrew. I just finished talking to John. I’ll talk to you if you give him the interview and the segment.” I replied firmly.  “Okay deal. Can you come by the house?” He questioned.  I hesitated “Maybe it’s better somewhere in public..” He sighed and I could feel the frustration rising.   “Y/N your stuff is still here. Come talk grab your stuff and you can go.”  I hesitated for a moment. Being at his house with no witnesses wasn’t a comforting thought. But John knew my where I was going. “Okay I’ll be there in 15.”  I hung up and dialed John’s number immediately. He picked up quickly.  “Hello?” John answered.  “Hey it’s Y/N. I’m on my way to Andrew’s. Um I hate to ask this but can you try calling me in about an hour? And if I don’t answer can you come by the house? Or send help?” I requested urgently.  John sighed as he paused finally realizing maybe I wasn’t making everything up after all. “Yeah for sure. I’m sorry I asked you to do this.. and please don’t tell Dean yet he will be pissed.”  “Don’t apologize. I understand I won’t tell Dean. Just please call me in an hour” I pleaded.  “I will” John assured me before we hung up.  I ended the call and started my car heading towards the familiar house that always filled me with anxiety.   I wasn’t sure why Andrew had insisted on talking or why he’d used John as a middleman but I knew I had to do this for him. For Dean. For myself. I needed to get closure to say goodbye to the pain of the past. To do something big for others and myself.  As I pulled up I stared at the house. It looked charming from the outside and no one would suspect the nightmares hidden behind those gray walls. But I knew. I knew the darkness that lived within.  The walk to the door felt endless each step heavy with fear. When I finally knocked time seemed to quicken.  Andrew greeted me with a smirk. “Y/N come on in.”  I managed a smile and entered glancing around at the unchanged surroundings. My clothes were still in a hamper as if time had stood still in this place. Did he even live here anymore?  Sitting down on the couch I waited for Andrew to join me. He sat across from me his expression unreadable. “How have you been?” he finally asked.  “I’ve been alright… How about you?”  He smirked avoiding the question with an angry look. “So I hear you’re living with Dean now.”  I nodded feeling the tension rise. “Yeah for a few weeks.”  He sighed a hint of frustration in his voice. “This is getting ridiculous Y/N. You must know people are talking.”  “Talking about what?”  “About you leaving a news reporter for a mechanic. It doesn’t reflect well on you or me for that fact.”  I felt anger flare up inside me. “I don’t care what people say. I’m happy.”  He rolled his eyes. “Are you really? Happier than you were with us?”  “Andrew…”  “No let’s talk about this. Are you really happier now than when it was us? What did I do so wrong?” Andrew’s voice was edged with disbelief.  I couldn’t meet his eyes gripping my fists tightly. “You hurt me.”  He shook his head “You know your not innocent here. You always pushed me. We fight is that enough to throw everything away?.”  I stood up the anger boiling over. “Yes! It was enough because you beat me until your fists were covered in my blood and then you made me believe it never happened. You made everyone think I was worthless and a liar and that it was my fault. I’m glad I left.”  He scoffed advancing towards me. “I have much more at stake than you do Y/N. What do you have? A family that barely acknowledges you? No friends? A mechanic as a boyfriend? I moved here hoping to build a future with you. If you slander my name it could destroy my career. Do you not understand that?”  I lowered my head as fear flowed through me at his distance “I understand but I haven’t gone around spreading lies about you. I’ve only defended myself when others accused me. No offense Andrew but I don’t care enough about you to ruin your career.”  He rolled his eyes and sat down burying his head in his hands pretending to be upset. This was his tactic after every major argument—break down apologize beg for forgiveness make me believe it was my fault. But this time it wouldn’t work.  “Why did you want to talk to me?” I asked my voice steadier now.  “Because I want you back. I want the rumours the fights the drama to stop. You and I have a history. Can’t you just come back home?”  I shook my head staring at the floor. “This isn’t my home. Dean is my home. You messed up. You hurt me. You tried to destroy my life. I’m not coming back.”  He looked at me his expression hardening. “Never?”  “Never.”  He nodded standing up and wiping his hands on his pants. “Fine. Your stuff is still upstairs. Let’s go get it and I’ll help you load it into your car.”  I nodded cautiously and followed Andrew upstairs to our old room. He moved with intentional slowness his behavior unsettling. Deep down I sensed danger but I was too overwhelmed to act on it.   Checking the time I realized John would call in about 15 minutes. I held onto the hope that I would be safe then.  But Andrew’s anger was overflowing he was disgusted by the fact that I would choose Dean over him he couldn’t understand what he did wrong or he didn’t care.  Once we got into the bedroom he turned towards me a sinister grin on his face. “I’ve changed my deal. I’ll do the segment and the interview only if you come home to me.”  I froze as the anger bubbled “That wasn’t the deal. You said if I came to talk to you.”  He smirked and rolled his eyes “Yeah becuase I needed you to come here. Do we have a deal or not?”  I didn’t even hesitate there was no way this was happening. “Absolutely not this is done.”  Turning to walk away fear rose as I felt his hand gripping my arm tightly “Our conversation isn’t fucking done do not walk away from me.”  “Andrew let go of me!” I shouted horror filling my body as he pulled me closer hand closing around my throat squeezing the sides tightly.  I panicked and acted fast raising my knee to kick him before I rushed out of the bedroom as fast as my feet would take me.  I reached the top of the stairs when I felt a force push me from behind. Time seemed to slow as I tumbled down the stairs landing with a painful thud at the bottom.   Andrew stood at the top looking down at me with a cruel grin. I struggled to move feeling intense pain throughout my body. My legs were numb my head throbbed and the taste of blood filled my mouth. I feared I had broken my entire body.  My phone rang and I strained to reach it but Andrew was quicker. He descended the stairs snatching it away and covering my mouth to keep me quiet. He answered the call with a falsely calm attitude.  “Hello John. Yeah everything’s fine. Y/N is just in the bathroom. Oh and tell Dean that Y/N decided to come back to me. I’ll definitely be doing your interview. Talk later bye.”  Tears streamed down my face as Andrew ended the call. I rested my head back praying desperately that John wouldn’t believe Andrew’s lies that he would sense something was terribly wrong.   Please I pleaded silently please see through this. Please John save me.  Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed it! Chapter 7 coming soon stay tuned!  Like comment and reblog feedback is my fuel 💕,2024-07-13 21:17:55 GMT

373,Supernatural,['us politics'  'donald trump'  'destiel'  '2024 us elections'],anthroposeen,i think its important for people to not lose hope or unity right now as we get closer to november and the polls  the assassination attempt is going to make trump a martyr for the republican party and it will increase turn out from undecided voters and centrists so now is the time for left-leaning voters to actually find unity amongst ourselves and VOTE!! if trump was able to lose his position in 2020 the first president to lose reelection in decades then we can keep him out of the white house again but only if we take action  unfortunately we find ourselves in a position to vote for the lesser of two evils again but if there isnt a concentrated effort made to vote together then trump will have enough backing to make it back into the presidency. im not saying the 2 party system is productive and im not saying that biden is an ethical and good leader (his actions against palestine are abhorrent and we need to hold him accountable for the complicity in genocide) but things will not improve under trump- he will continue the support of the ethnic cleansing of palestine and make life worse for underprivileged americans under project 2025.   the deadline for voter registration is in october registering is easy and you can do it online! and i encourage everyone eligible to use their vote to keep him out of office,2024-07-14 00:59:11 GMT

4,Supernatural,['idle speaks'  'john winchester'  'spn'],idledreams4,ok this is a hot take: but you guys need to be nicer to John   He was doing his best  Sure not every decision was the best possible one. But we ALL make mistakes.   His entire life got flipped upside in one night   He lost EVERYTHING the night Mary died  He wanted to be there for the boys he really did. He wanted to keep them safe and as far away from the truth as he could for as long as possible. Unfortunately those two things conflict  Think about it; if your significant other or someone you care deeply about was ripped away from you and you knew the monster that took them from you was out there: would you not do everything in your power to bring them to justice?  But it wasn’t just Mary he lost that night.   He lost the love of his life yes. But his entire world changed.   You all seem to forget that he wasn’t a hunter. That night where he lost Mary was his first encounter with any sort of monster (that he would remember at least.)      I don’t know about the rest of you but I’ve read both John’s journal and Bobby’s guidebooks. So I’ve seen so many things that never made it into the show.   I’ve seen all the regret and the pain and the desperation that the boys never did     John was a mess after the fire. For the first few weeks he was almost never sober.   He had no idea what he was doing. Mary’s journals had largely been destroyed so he had little to go off of.   Bobby got him on his feet at least  He felt so bad about everything the boys had to go through.  He felt terrible for all the responsibilities Dean took on   I can’t tell what broke his heart more: hearing baby Sammy crying for his mother or realizing that he had stopped.      Everything that John did was for the boys  He wanted to kill that demon so they could have a normal life  He knew he’d be living in constant fear until Azazel was dead and worse: that the boys his boys would be in danger.   And he couldn’t have that.      Look I’m not saying he was perfect. There’s a lot that never should have happened. But he doesn’t deserve the hatred you all seem to have for him. He was just a desperate father trying to protect his kids.,2024-07-14 04:52:19 GMT
98,Supernatural,['dean winchester'  'spn fanfic'  'dean winchester x reader'  'dean winchester smut'],stvrfir0,We can’t be safe forever.  Demon Dean Winchester x fem reader     you sprint down the hallway of the Bunker the flashing red light and accompanying alarm making this feel exactly like a horror movie. How the hell had it come to this!? Dean was after you he wanted you in more ways than just the usual sense of the word and if he caught you. “Come on sweetheart you can’t hide from me!” Dean’s voice echoes eerily through the halls his accompanying laugh sending shivers down your spine. You’re on your own and so so screwed.      Y/n was running down the halls as her heels click. The Bunker halls echo with the sound of your heels against the tiles signalling your every movement to the one hunting you. He grins to himself as he stalks in your general direction eyes narrowed and focused solely on catching up with you. “Here little mouse…..” he sings out licking his lips as he hears you get farther away the thrill of the chase getting to him a little.     Y/n throws her heels a different direction  Deans eyebrows shoot up in surprise as he hears the heels clatter down a hallway to his left. “Clever little thing” he murmurs changing directions. He keeps his footsteps as quiet as possible wanting to try and catch you unaware. His heart beats with excitement his eyes practically glowed with the thrill of hunting you down   He reaches the end of the new hallway his eyes darting around for any sign of you. He spots the discarded heels on the floor by a row of bookshelves a pleased smirk growing on his face as he slowly and silently pads closer to the area  He crouches next to your abandoned heels lightly running his fingers over the thin straps. He shakes his head affectionately and murmurs a soft “cheeky minx” to himself his mind already imagining exactly what you looked like in the rest of that dress and trying desperately to rein his thoughts in.  He stays knelt in front of the shoes for a moment his mind still spinning. He scoffs and shakes his head looking up and taking in the sight before him. Rows and rows of books all carefully placed on their respective shelves.   Deans eyes scan the rows of bookshelves a sly smirk on his face. He knows you’re somewhere near he can feel it in his bones. He stands up moving silently down the long row keeping his eyes and ears open for any sign of you.   He stops and cranes his head slightly hearing a soft sound come from a few rows over. His smirk grows and he moves towards the sound. You were going to be in so much trouble…he couldn’t wait to catch you.   Dean reaches the end of the row he was in and carefully peeks down the next his hands clenching and unclenching in anticipation. He can hear you moving amongst the rows your soft and cautious footsteps ringing out in the quiet Bunker. He steps from the shadows his eyes immediately narrowing as he sees you standing with your back to him.   He takes a few slow and purposeful steps forward a wide smirk on his face. “No point in hiding sweet cheeks. I’ve already found you..” he murmurs his voice taking on a darker huskier tone. His eyes rake up and down your figure enjoying how his favourite black dress hugs your curves in all the right places. His tongue swipes across his bottom lip at just the sight of you. Y/n gulps “we can talk about this…”   Dean continues to advance moving closer and closer until he has you backed up against a bookshelf your back pressed against the wooden surface. His hands come up to land against the bookshelf on either side of your head effectively trapping you. He leans in his body flush against yours his voice low and dangerous “We can talk about it afterwards. There’s something else I want to do first….”   He moves closer his chest now pressed against yours his head lowering so he can speak directly into your ear “You have no idea what you’re doing to me sweet stuff…walking around looking like that and thinking I wouldn’t just lose it and hunt you down…..” His hands come down from the shelf his left hand gripping your hip firmly the other tangling into your hair and gently tugging so your head tilts back giving him a perfect view of your now exposed neck and collarbones. Y/n groans “ow..”   Deans eyes rake down the expanse of smooth flawless skin in front of him his grip a little tighter in your hair “Shhh….don’t give me these pretty little sounds sweetheart” He smirks and moves his head down nuzzling just below your ear his warm breath washing over your skin in a way that sends a shiver down your entire spine  He continues nuzzling at your neck his nose gently tracing over the soft skin. His teeth graze against your pulse point before his mouth sucks in the flesh determined to leave a nice big mark where everyone would see it - a warning to anyone who thought they could touch you only one man got to do that.   He brings the hand on your hip up to your shoulder his fingers slipping under the thin strap of the dress. He moves his head up to look at you his pupils blown wide and his breathing coming in fast and heavy. A small growl escapes him “Damnit…how’d you get this on by yourself…” Y/n smiles “it’s a girl thing”   He groans softly his tongue darting out to wet his bottom lip as he tugs at the strap trying to figure out a way to get the dress off you. His eyes roam over the deep v-neck the material stretching over your gorgeous curves “You’ve been holding out on me sweetheart….I should punish you for letting this other people see my girl like this….”  He growls again in frustration trying to pull the strap down but the angle and tightness of the dress makes it impossible. He presses even closer the hand on your hip sliding down behind you gripping your ass in a firm grip.   Deans hands move to your waist suddenly his grip tight as he spins your body around quickly so your back is to him. His left hand goes back to your hair his right hand on your hip and he pulls your body back against his hard cock forcing you to bend forward towards the bookshelf in front of you Y/n gasp “Dean!”   His hand is still tangled in your hair keeping your head tilted back so he can speak directly in your ear. You can feel his chest rising and falling against your back his breathing heavy as he growls lowly “You have no idea how many times I’ve imagined how this would go you and me up against the bookshelf in the library my hands all over you….”  The hand on your hip moves further up his fingertips tracing over the bare skin at the bottom of the dress. He’s breathing faster now his voice raspier as he struggles to control himself “I didn’t think you’d be so damn stubborn. You’ve put me through hell for the last few weeks you know that? Walking around like this teasing the hell out of me and then running away….it drives me crazy sweetheart…..”   He moves closer his hips pressing against you the hardness of his cock as he grinds slowly against you. The hand at your hip moves higher until his fingers are toying with the edge of your panties. He tugs gently the fabric riding up a little the action making the strap of your dress slip down further exposing even more skin to his hungry eyes. Y/n gasp and moans “Dean…”   Hearing the sound of your gasp and moan only spurs him on. He groans in response his hand leaving your hair and coming up to your chin tilting your head to the side giving him access to your neck “You like teasing me then princess? Is that what it is? You like knowing what you do to me how you make me come undone…” His teeth graze against the sensitive skin below your ear his tongue tracing a path down the side of your neck.   His other hand is still toy with the top of your panties. His fingertips tracing lightly over the lace. His breathing is faster now his hips still grinding against yours trying to relieve some of the aching he’s feeling. “You drive me crazy you know that? Everything you do what you wear…it’s driving me mad….” He groans his tongue tracing a path from the back of your earlobe up to the top of your shoulder  He pulls the strap of your dress down again giving him access to your shoulder. He places kiss after kiss down the exposed skin “You’re mine. No one elses. I’ll prove it….” He lifts his head and runs his nose up the side of your neck breathing in your intoxicating scent before his teeth nip at your ear.   The hand at your hip moves around to the front his fingers tracing over the soft material of the dress his palm resting over your stomach. He slides it down slightly fingers finding the edge of the dress and slowly pushing it up exposing more of your bare skin to his lust filled eyes.  “I need to see you sweetheart I need to touch you….” He murmurs against your skin his palm rubbing slow circles over your stomach so close to where you need him. His left hand comes up fingers tracing over the soft skin on the back of your neck.  He spins you around again so you’re facing him this time. The hand on your stomach moves to your hip holding you in place while he looks you up and down his eyes roaming over every inch of exposed skin drinking in the sight of you in your current state. A low growl escapes his lips again his desire for you so clear in his eyes.   His mouth crashes against yours in a bruising kiss his tongue seeking yours as his hips grind against you his body aching. He pulls away from the kiss his lips moving to your ear his voice a low ragged whisper.   His hips move again his body rubbing against you just right his breath coming out in ragged gasps his mind so lost to pleasure that coherent words seem a difficult task one that requires more brain power than he’s currently capable of filling you up.  He can’t take it anymore the feeling of you rubbing against him the sounds of your moans and the taste of your skin driving him wild. He positions himself at your entrance the tip of him just resting against you his hardness aching to be inside   Y/n looks at him “please..” He meets your gaze his eyes so clouded with lust it’s difficult to see any green. He can’t hold back much longer but he can’t help but tease you one more time. His hands grip your hips holding them firmly in place his body still pressed against you.“Mmm you’re gonna have to beg a little harder than that sweetheart….”  Y/n looks at him “please I need you” He groans as your whine his hips jerking forward almost of their own accord his body struggling to hold back. But he restrains himself his hands digging into your hips his voice coming out in a low dangerous growl. “Please what sweetheart? You have to be specific”  Y/n sighs “I need you..” He groans again his body reacting to your words desperate to give you what you’re begging for but still he holds back. He leans down his lips next to your ear his voice low and intense “And what are you going to give me in return sweetheart?”  Y/n smiles softly “anything you want..” He groans low his body pressing even harder against you his hips grinding against you again the feeling of him just at your entrance driving him wild “You’re being pretty naughty sweetheart….giving yourself to me like that… letting me do whatever I want…” He mutters his lips running over your neck his teeth gently nipping at the skin  He groans at your desperate actions struggling to hold himself together much longer. With one final hard grind against you he finally gives in and pulls his hips back just enough to position himself at your entrance but he doesn’t push in just yet his eyes still looking into yours his voice a low rough hiss “Are you sure sweetheart?”  Y/n nods “mhm” He moans at your eagerness his arms wrapping around you holding you against him as he slowly pushes himself inside of you his lips going to your neck his eyes shutting again as he fights to hold onto what little sanity he has left “Oh god sweetheart…” He moans his voice muffled as he buries his face in your shoulder  He stops for a moment pausing once he buried himself completely inside you every breath coming out in a ragged gasp his head still buried against your shoulder his body practically shaking with the effort to hold back to give you time to adjust to him. Y/n breaths heavily “mmm yes”   He groans and moves slowly pulling back just a little before thrusting forward again his teeth nipping at your shoulder his body taking over instincts taking control as he picks up a slow steady rhythm. Y/n moans “mmm please go faster..”   He groans low at your words his brain struggling to understand what you’re saying. He can’t think straight anymore every cell in his body focused on the feel of you the sound of your moans the taste of your skin. “You want me to go faster sweetheart?” Y/n nods “yes please..” she touches his cheek   He groans again his body responding to your touch. He looks into your face your skin flushed your eyes half-lidded lips parted and he almost loses all control. A low growl escapes his throat his hands gripping your hips tighter as he starts to thrust into you faster his breathing becoming rapid and ragged  The sound of your scream makes his head swim his mind so overwhelmed with the feel of you with the sound of your voice the sight of your body responding so beautifully to his touch that he can’t do anything but moan your name “Oh sweetheart….you feel so damn good….” He groans  Y/n moans “don’t… don’t stop” The words send a shock straight to his core his hips start moving even faster than before his body taking on a life of it’s own chasing after the pleasure pushing the limits of his self-control. It’s all he can do to keep himself from completely losing all self-control “Fuck sweetheart….I don’t think I could even if you begged me too….” He gasps out the words his voice low and rough   Y/n moans “I’m so close” He can tell you’re close from the sounds of your moans the way your body is responding to him how your hands are grasping at him desperately and it takes everything he has left to hold it together “Come for me sweetheart…I want to feel you come for me…”  The feeling of you coming undone around him finally pushes him over the edge he gasps out your name holding you tight against him as he rides out his own orgasm his body trembling and shuddering waves of pleasure coursing through him his mind going blank as he loses himself completely in the pleasure of you  Y/n moans “come for me dean” she says softly your words send a thrill through him he’s already so close but the sound of you begging him pushes him even closer to the edge “Oh sweetheart….I’m so close….” He gasps his voice ragged strained with the effort to hold on  His body is taut with tension every muscle strained with the effort to hold back but he can’t resist any longer your words and the feel of filling you up.  He groans loudly overwhelmed by pleasure as he finally comes shuddering against you his hand grasping your hips so tightly you’re sure he’ll leave fingerprints behind his whole body tense as he rides out the waves of pleasure his mind completely blank focused only on you  Y/n groans and moans. He collapses against you his body shaking for a few moments as he comes down from the high of his orgasm his breath coming out in ragged gasps his head buried against your neck his arms wrapped tight around you  Y/n gasp and closes her eyes as she felt his come inside of her “that’s was so good” He groans at you words still too spent to form a coherent thought let alone a proper response. He holds you tight against him his heart beating furiously his mind still in a daze from the sheer intensity of what just happened  Eventually his breathing began to slow and his mind starts to clear. He slowly lifts his head to look at you his gaze meeting yours his expression still full of lust but there’s something else now something soft and tender a hint of vulnerability that surprises even him  Y/n smiles softly and kisses his forehead. He closes his eyes melting a little at the soft kisses you place on his forehead. He lets out a quiet sigh moving so he’s lying next to you rather than on top of you his arms still wrapped around you holding you close against him. There’s a moment of silence as he gathers his thoughts his heart finally starting to return to a normal pace,2024-07-14 04:50:53 GMT

TW/CW: Abuse (by Reader’s father) Mention of Dean hitting Reader Dean doubting himself Mentions of injuries (bruises welt etc.) Angst Angst Angst Dean Winchester x Reader  Requested?: No  Word Count: 1979  A/N: Idek where this came from. It sorta spawned from me wishing Dean could show up &amp; rescue me from my dog shit life (I’m not being abused I just have a lot of bullshit going on with my parents) &amp; also just me feeling angsty as fuck. Anyway I hope you enjoy the read. REQUESTS ARE OPEN! Much love to all!  (Y/N)’s POV     John Winchester was a hard ass at times but he was never cruel. I think that’s why when his teenage son Dean returned from what was supposed to be a quick grocery store run with myself around the same age in tow claiming “Her dad is a monster. We have to help her” he couldn’t just ignore me &amp; send me on my way. He visibly stowed his anger at Dean’s tardiness &amp; observed me. I’m sure he took note of the bruises scattered across the little bit of skin I had visible some were old some were new. He probably noticed the split lip paired with a blossoming black eye. Yet he ushered me into the car with orders for Sam &amp; Dean to stay put.     When he pulled into my driveway my face felt warn with embarrassment. From the outside my house looked like no one had lived there in years. He walked me to the front door &amp; knocked. When there was no response he knocked again.     I looked up at him “He’s probably asleep.” I opened the door &amp; walked in. Inside the house was spotless. When I entered my father stirred on the couch &amp; sat up.     He was very clearly drunk as he slurred his words “Where the hell have you been girl?”   &lt;!-- more --&gt;  I looked down at my shopping bags in my hands “I went out to get milk &amp; bread.”     My father rubbed his eyes still having not noticed John standing just outside the front door “Ain’t you got something to clean? Make yourself useful &amp; get me beer first.”     I hid my face from John as I shuffled over to the fridge &amp; retrieved a beer as instructed. I walked over to the couch &amp; handed it to him “What would you like me to clean?”     He looked up at me furious “Are you dumb? You should be able to figure out how to clean by now.” Dean was right this man is a monster. I took a few steps back &amp; looked around me for something to clean.     In the blink of an eye my father jumped up from the couch &amp; grabbed my arm “Get your useless ass into the kitchen &amp; wash those damn dishes” he yelled before shoving me so hard toward the counter that I lost balance &amp; hit the floor. John rushed over &amp; offered his hand to me as my father lazily wandered over to the couch &amp; plopped down. I gently took John’s hand &amp; was hauled to my feet.     Suddenly my father noticed John’s presence “Who the hell are you?” John said nothing &amp; simply pulled the me to the front door placing himself between me &amp; my father who was still plastered on the couch. Before the door shut behind us I heard my father grumble “Good riddance. She’s worthless anyway.” Tears rushed to my eyes but I fought them back as John pulled me toward the car. Once we were safely inside he sped back toward the motel.     There was never a missing person’s report filed or police involvement. My father never bothered to look for me. People we encountered never questioned why I was with the Winchesters. It seemed everyone assumed I was their daughter &amp; sister. Sure life on the road was never easy &amp; sometimes John was hard on me but I would much rather stay with the Winchesters than to go back to my father. At some point I stopped only giving my first name when introducing myself &amp; began introducing myself as (Y/N) Winchester. They were the closest thing I had ever had to a family.     I am pulled back to the present at the faint sound of voices outside my bedroom door. They’re too quiet to make out what is being said but I roll over grabbing my headphones to play music to drown them out completely.   Dean’s POV     “What are you doing?” Sam asks shaking me from my thoughts. I stay silent. “Dean what’s wrong? Why are you sitting outside of (Y/N)’s door in the middle of the night?” I look down at my lap. “She tried to get you to talk to her didn’t she?” I nod. “What’d you do? Yell at her?”     I clench my jaw “And hit her.”     Sam is taken aback “You-” It’s quiet. “You can’t apologize to her if you’re just sitting out here on your ass.”     “She’s hasn’t cried” I mumble.     “How do you know?” Sam asks.     “When she ran out of the room I realized what I did &amp; followed her. By the time I made it to her door she had already shut it.”     “So you-”     “I’ve been sitting here trying to convince myself to knock &amp; she hasn’t cried at all”     “You know when she doesn’t cry she’s-”     “I know” I grit my teeth “She’s angry.”     “Well like I said you can’t make it right sitting out here.”     “Not long after she left her dad &amp; hit the road with us I promised her that I’d never let anything happen to her. I’d always protect her.”     “Dean-”     “I hit her Sam. I’m no better than that piece of shit that calls himself her father.”     “Dean don’t. That man let a stranger walk out of his house with her. He didn’t give two shits that he hurt her. He wouldn’t be sitting outside her bedroom door nearly in tears trying to convince himself to apologize. You’re better than that guy. You’re her best friend &amp; you need to talk to her.” I tossed Sam’s words around in my head for a few moments before he walked off saying “If you do decide to get up &amp; knock I might think about rescuing you when she beats the shit out of you.”     “I deserve whatever she does to me” I mumble to myself.   (Y/N)’s POV     After a few hours of listening to music my headphones beep that they’re dying. I pull them off &amp; toss them toward the end of the bed making a mental note to charge them later. For a few moments all I can hear is the music still playing through my dying headphones. Then there’s a knock at the door. I hold my breath hoping they’ll go away. I’m sure it’s Dean but I’m hoping it’s Sam. If I face Dean right now I might kill him. Okay maybe not kill but definitely maim.     Another knock sounds. I begrudgingly toss the covers off of my legs &amp; get up. As I pad over to the door the knocker speaks “(Y/N) please let me in. I am so unbelievably sorry. I know I don’t deserve it but please let me check on you.” I’m quiet mentally arguing with myself about whether I should open the door or not. “Okay… I understand. I’ll leave you alone.”     I rush to open the door. His head shoots up to look at me. The worry &amp; fear on his face hurts my heart. I know Dean. I know him better than I know myself sometimes which is why I never expected the outburst from him that I got. I clench my jaw “I’m fine.” Dean scans my face before breaking eye contact &amp; looking down at his feet. I leave the door open &amp; return to sit on the end of my bed. He stays put at the open door so I give him a look that says “Well come in.”     He begins making his way to me “(Y/N) I-” he drops to his knees in front of me &amp; drops his head into his hands “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what came over me &amp; I know that’s no excuse but please know I never wanted to hurt you I just got angry.” When he looks up again there is tears in his eyes. His voice cracks as he reaches up “Can I?”     I nod. He gently runs the pad of his thumb over the welt &amp; slowly forming bruise on my cheek. I notice his jaw clench as he pulls his hand away “Let’s hear it…”     I tilt my head at him with confusion on my face “Hear what?”     “How you never want to see me again &amp; I’m a piece of shit. I’m sure you’re probably wanting to give me a couple good right hooks for what I did” his voice is small &amp; quiet as he continues “I deserve it.”     I think for a moment “You’re right. I want to beat the shit out of you. The crazy &amp; scary thing is I’d rather crawl into your lap &amp; you hold me like we used to do when I would wake up screaming from a nightmare about my father. I want you to tell me everything is okay &amp; that you’re here &amp; you’ll keep me safe.” I let my words hang in the air for a second &amp; it breaks my heart to see him break a little too. “But… you hit me Dean… You’re supposed to make sure no one ever hurts me but you hurt me. I want so badly to just brush it off &amp; move on but I can’t. Every instinct in my bones is screaming that I can’t trust you.”     He nods solemnly “I understand. I’ll leave you alone.”     He stands to leave but I grab his arm “Contrary to my usual belief my instincts aren’t winning this time.” I tug him to sit beside me on the bed “Dean you’re the most important person in my life. Somedays you’re all that keeps me going… I can’t lose you not when I know that outburst is not who you are.” He’s quiet but a look of hope grows on his face. I continue “I forgive you.”     A small smile graces his features “Thank you. You don’t know how much this means to me. I promise I will never hurt you again. I promise I’ll do better.” I nod &amp; we’re left in silence for a few moments before he speaks again “You were trying to get me to tell you why I’ve been distant lately.” I nod he takes a deep breath “I-… I’ve been trying to distance myself from you because… because I love you (Y/N). It terrifies me because I know you deserve better &amp; I know you don’t feel the same way so I was hoping distancing myself would make those feelings go away but if anything it made them worse &amp; I was just super frustrated that it wasn’t working so when you came to me asking what’s wrong I just exploded.” he pauses “I’m sorry you got caught in the blast radius.”     I take his hand in mine “I’m gonna break this down piece by piece. First of all idk how on earth you think I’m gonna find anyone better than you. You always take care of me &amp; keep me safe. You know me better than anyone. You understand me better than anyone. I won’t find that anywhere else. Second of all how dare you assume I don’t feel the same way” I giggle “When did you become a mind reader? Thirdly why didn’t you just tell me you needed space? I would’ve understood. I didn’t enjoy just being left in the cold by my best friend &amp; the man I love.”     He looks me in the eye “I don’t deserve you ya know that?” I shrug. He chuckles “I’m sorry I didn’t just say something. I’ll add it to my list of things to be better about.”     I squeeze his hand “While you’re at it add stop doubting yourself to the list.” I place my free hand on his cheek “I wish you could see yourself the way I do.”     He leans his forehead against mine “I love you (Y/N)”     I smile “I love you too Dean.”   More Dean Winchester  Masterlist,2024-07-14 04:43:16 GMT

Who else could I pair Adam with except canon Michael?  Enjoy this short one-shot that shows how I imagine their love-story started in the very depths of hell.   Community label due to some references of what is happening in hell between Lucifer and Sam.   Summary:   Adam struggles in the cage as Lucifer imparts particularly sadistic torture on his older half-brother Sam in the cage in hell and as he fights his own psyche he finds himself transported to a beautiful space and supported by an unexpected ally that may have the potential to become far more than a formerly unwelcome visitor in his body. Or how the love story of Michael and Adam may have started.  Link to the fic on AO3: Does This Help?  Or read on below full fic posted under the keep reading bar.      &lt;!-- more --&gt; At first Adam was angry angry that Sam his goodie-two-shoes saving people hunting things older half-brother got them into this mess. Mess being the cage in the deepest reaches of hell where no normal demon even dared to set foot lest they be vaporized by Lucifer’s wrath that could reach beyond the cage but could not facilitate his freedom. That fact alone was all it took some days and on others he would lecture the cowering tall Winchester with the floppy brown hair about his life of failures.  The cage was a complete mind-fuck for the human psyche that much Adam knew to be true add to that the sharing of your own God-given body with an archangel who was about as warm and fluffy as a metal rod and you had a situation that was not only untenable it was bound to break anyone no matter how strong they were.  It had been well over fifty years by now and over time Adam and Michael found a sort of truce with one another in that they were not surrendering to the ferocious but ultimately impotent anger of Lucifer nor did they subscribe to Sam’s wailing agonized suffering that seemed to dictate his every day of existence down here.  Most days they acted like the neighbours who pretended that it wasn’t their business that what happened over at the Jones’ was not their responsibility. However today Adam could not pretend could not compartmentalize himself away from Sam’s suffering.  Lucifer was imposing particularly sadistic tortures on the former hunter that was nothing more than a whimpering pet his soul long ago ripped frazzled and flailed into shreds of consciousness that may never be whole again even if they were saved by someone anyone today. He picked Sam apart body part by body part would only continue once his once perfect vessel would name the part removed out loud a psychological mind game that Sam had long ago been broken by as it meant he had a literal say in his torment continuing.  Adam was flustered anxious crying fitfully as every one of Sam’s pained noises ripped across his ear drums like nails on a chalkboard he wanted to jump out of his skin be anywhere but here and all of a sudden he was.  The scene reminded him of the one beach vacation his mom ever managed to make happen for them. Santa Monica beach in California he felt the sun warm on his skin heard the waves as they broke on the sandy shore and curled his toes in the sand to test that this was in fact real.  “I’m afraid it’s not 100% real but it’s something I learned form my little brother Gabriel. He liked to escape whenever the arguments between Luci and I got too loud for him. He’d fabricate a world pocket with his grace make it move sound and feel just like the real thing.”  “Why would you take me here if we only have to go back to reality after all. You can’t keep this up forever can you?”  “No but your body seemed … stressed like you were what’s the word; hyperventilating?”  “I was“ he hoped Michael calling it his body and not their vessel counted for something.  “Does this help would you like it to look different?” It was almost endearing to Adam how considerate Michael was trying to be.  “Yes it does Michael thank you and no this is really nice” little did Adam know that this gesture of protectiveness would be the first plot-point in a highly unconventional love story that would span over a thousand years.,2024-07-14 06:57:47 GMT

You and the Winchesters frequented second-hand shops; your clothing got ruined pretty often so you had to buy cheap. That’s also why you wore so much flannel it was easy to find here.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; The boys hadn’t joined you on this shopping trip so you were left to peruse the store without Dean getting onto you for &#x27;getting distracted by the dead people stuff’. I mean in your defense wasn’t that kind of part of your job?  As you looked through the men’s clothing for a replacement jacket for Sam something on one of the end caps caught your eye. You went over and picked up the deep emerald green suit tie. It reminded you of Dean’s pretty green eyes.   In the years you had been hunting with the brothers you had developed quite a crush on the older Winchester. Crush? Let’s face it. You were in love with him and you had alway loved his beautiful eyes.   You almost wanted to buy the tie for him. You rolled your eyes at the thought. It’s not like the boys were big on gift-giving. Debating for a moment you decided he could wear it with his &#x27;fed threads’ ‐as he called your fake FBI suits- and tossed it in the cart before you could second guess yourself.   “Honey I’m home” you greeted in a sing-song tone as you entered the motel room you were sharing with the boys.   Digging in your bag you handed Sam the jacket you had gotten him and he thanked you. Dean looked up from where he sat at the end of one of the beds cleaning his gun.   “I got you something too” you said dropping the tie onto the bed next to him.  He picked it up and looked at you with a brief look of confusion.   “It matches your eyes.”  Why did you say that? You internally cringed feeling the heat rise in your face. Instead of looking at him you stuffed your new clothes into you duffle bag.   “Thanks Sweetheart” Dean said a sweet smile gracing his lips.   “I’m going to take a shower.” You hurried into the bathroom and shut the door behind you. Really you wanted to run away from this situation so he didn’t see how flustered you were.   “Awww” Sam said in a mocking tone as soon as the bathroom door shut behind you.   You may have missed how Dean blushed when you said that but Sam didn’t and he wasn’t going to miss the opportunity to tease his older brother. He knew that Dean had had feeling for you for years but was too blind to realize that you felt the same.  “Shut up” Dean said brushing off his bothers’ teasing. He ran his fingers over the fabric of the tie and smiled to himself. He knew he would keep it forever.,2024-07-14 06:49:27 GMT

Sam wastes no time in removing the rest of Benny’s cumbersome clothes leaving him completely bare for him to see.

Sam buries himself between the burly man’s legs tongue licking him over in one unabashed spit-slick sweep.

His nose brushes against the wiry soft hairs against Benny’s pelvis breathing in the aroma of his gas station soap and salty sweat Benny himself tasting almost earthy and damp. Sam seals his lips over the hardened nub of the man’s clit licking and flicking with his tongue in intervals as he creates a perfect suction the man above swearing in a slew of French and English.   He adds a finger then two curling up against his sweet spot as he continues to lavish Benny in feverish licks and suctions. The vampire pulses and throbs around him the taste of him growing headier and heavier spurring Sam on as he adds another finger and rams them in and out harder and faster savoring the screams of pleasure as he buries his face even deeper. A sudden rush of hot and vicious fluid coats Sam’s chin and lips thick and dripping down his neck as Benny’s muscular thighs squeeze around his head. Benny sounds vaguely out of breath whimpering at the sudden onslaught of overstimulation as Sam licks him clean. “A’ight s’nough get up here.” Benny asks thickly his accent rough as gravel as he tugs at Sam’s hair.   Sam goes crawling up Benny’s overheated body and nipping at his collarbone before capturing his lips humming as big and calloused hands roved over his body thighs moving to wrap around his waist and bracket them together.

Who else could I pair Adam with except canon Michael?  Enjoy this short one-shot that shows how I imagine their love-story started in the very depths of hell.   Community label due to some references of what is happening in hell between Lucifer and Sam.   Summary:   Adam struggles in the cage as Lucifer imparts particularly sadistic torture on his older half-brother Sam in the cage in hell and as he fights his own psyche he finds himself transported to a beautiful space and supported by an unexpected ally that may have the potential to become far more than a formerly unwelcome visitor in his body. Or how the love story of Michael and Adam may have started.  Link to the fic on AO3: Does This Help?  Or read on below full fic posted under the keep reading bar.      &lt;!-- more --&gt; At first Adam was angry angry that Sam his goodie-two-shoes saving people hunting things older half-brother got them into this mess. Mess being the cage in the deepest reaches of hell where no normal demon even dared to set foot lest they be vaporized by Lucifer’s wrath that could reach beyond the cage but could not facilitate his freedom. That fact alone was all it took some days and on others he would lecture the cowering tall Winchester with the floppy brown hair about his life of failures.  The cage was a complete mind-fuck for the human psyche that much Adam knew to be true add to that the sharing of your own God-given body with an archangel who was about as warm and fluffy as a metal rod and you had a situation that was not only untenable it was bound to break anyone no matter how strong they were.  It had been well over fifty years by now and over time Adam and Michael found a sort of truce with one another in that they were not surrendering to the ferocious but ultimately impotent anger of Lucifer nor did they subscribe to Sam’s wailing agonized suffering that seemed to dictate his every day of existence down here.  Most days they acted like the neighbours who pretended that it wasn’t their business that what happened over at the Jones’ was not their responsibility. However today Adam could not pretend could not compartmentalize himself away from Sam’s suffering.  Lucifer was imposing particularly sadistic tortures on the former hunter that was nothing more than a whimpering pet his soul long ago ripped frazzled and flailed into shreds of consciousness that may never be whole again even if they were saved by someone anyone today. He picked Sam apart body part by body part would only continue once his once perfect vessel would name the part removed out loud a psychological mind game that Sam had long ago been broken by as it meant he had a literal say in his torment continuing.  Adam was flustered anxious crying fitfully as every one of Sam’s pained noises ripped across his ear drums like nails on a chalkboard he wanted to jump out of his skin be anywhere but here and all of a sudden he was.  The scene reminded him of the one beach vacation his mom ever managed to make happen for them. Santa Monica beach in California he felt the sun warm on his skin heard the waves as they broke on the sandy shore and curled his toes in the sand to test that this was in fact real.  “I’m afraid it’s not 100% real but it’s something I learned form my little brother Gabriel. He liked to escape whenever the arguments between Luci and I got too loud for him. He’d fabricate a world pocket with his grace make it move sound and feel just like the real thing.”  “Why would you take me here if we only have to go back to reality after all. You can’t keep this up forever can you?”  “No but your body seemed … stressed like you were what’s the word; hyperventilating?”  “I was“ he hoped Michael calling it his body and not their vessel counted for something.  “Does this help would you like it to look different?” It was almost endearing to Adam how considerate Michael was trying to be.  “Yes it does Michael thank you and no this is really nice” little did Adam know that this gesture of protectiveness would be the first plot-point in a highly unconventional love story that would span over a thousand years.,2024-07-14 06:57:47 GMT

You and the Winchesters frequented second-hand shops; your clothing got ruined pretty often so you had to buy cheap. That’s also why you wore so much flannel it was easy to find here.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; The boys hadn’t joined you on this shopping trip so you were left to peruse the store without Dean getting onto you for &#x27;getting distracted by the dead people stuff’. I mean in your defense wasn’t that kind of part of your job?  As you looked through the men’s clothing for a replacement jacket for Sam something on one of the end caps caught your eye. You went over and picked up the deep emerald green suit tie. It reminded you of Dean’s pretty green eyes.   In the years you had been hunting with the brothers you had developed quite a crush on the older Winchester. Crush? Let’s face it. You were in love with him and you had alway loved his beautiful eyes.   You almost wanted to buy the tie for him. You rolled your eyes at the thought. It’s not like the boys were big on gift-giving. Debating for a moment you decided he could wear it with his &#x27;fed threads’ ‐as he called your fake FBI suits- and tossed it in the cart before you could second guess yourself.   “Honey I’m home” you greeted in a sing-song tone as you entered the motel room you were sharing with the boys.   Digging in your bag you handed Sam the jacket you had gotten him and he thanked you. Dean looked up from where he sat at the end of one of the beds cleaning his gun.   “I got you something too” you said dropping the tie onto the bed next to him.  He picked it up and looked at you with a brief look of confusion.   “It matches your eyes.”  Why did you say that? You internally cringed feeling the heat rise in your face. Instead of looking at him you stuffed your new clothes into you duffle bag.   “Thanks Sweetheart” Dean said a sweet smile gracing his lips.   “I’m going to take a shower.” You hurried into the bathroom and shut the door behind you. Really you wanted to run away from this situation so he didn’t see how flustered you were.   “Awww” Sam said in a mocking tone as soon as the bathroom door shut behind you.   You may have missed how Dean blushed when you said that but Sam didn’t and he wasn’t going to miss the opportunity to tease his older brother. He knew that Dean had had feeling for you for years but was too blind to realize that you felt the same.  “Shut up” Dean said brushing off his bothers’ teasing. He ran his fingers over the fabric of the tie and smiled to himself. He knew he would keep it forever.,2024-07-14 06:49:27 GMT

Also it was incredibly weird for a lady who was in her 50s to walk up to me after my Misha op and ask if I was flustered from meeting him. Like ma&#x27;am. He is literally older than my dad.  Finally some hellers/cockles shippers or just those who are obsessed with Misha and Jensen need to tone it down. I’m all for open expression in Fandom and shit but going to a con where you’re meeting/seeing some of your favorite actors and wearing a shirt that says “my ideal weight is Jensen ackles on top of me” (as an example there were others) is strange. I would never do that at all but at least not around my idol.  The con was cool and I did ask Jensen during my autograph if he would slap batman (also asked Ice-T this) and he gave the most bewildered look and said no.

(I would have spoken earlier but I was still riding the high of meeting Misha and Jensen)   At the con it immediately felt weird that there was only one panel at a time. (Yes I’m aware of limited spacing and timings for photos and autos). At other conventions I have gone to there’s often two or more panels happening around the same time.  Also it was incredibly weird for a lady who was in her 50s to walk up to me after my Misha op and ask if I was flustered from meeting him. Like ma&#x27;am. He is literally older than my dad.  Finally some hellers/cockles shippers or just those who are obsessed with Misha and Jensen need to tone it down. I’m all for open expression in Fandom and shit but going to a con where you’re meeting/seeing some of your favorite actors and wearing a shirt that says “my ideal weight is Jensen ackles on top of me” (as an example there were others) is strange. I would never do that at all but at least not around my idol.  The con was cool and I did ask Jensen during my autograph if he would slap batman (also asked Ice-T this) and he gave the most bewildered look and said no. The assistant next to him said yes so props to her.,2024-07-14 11:02:15 GMT

You rolled your eyes and dug some papers out of your bag handing them to him. “What’s that?”  “A campus map doofus and you orientation schedule. I told you to print it. Wifi on campus can be shitty” you said.   “Yes mom” he said making a show out of it.  “Freshman orientation is over in Jub Hall. Giant banner in front of it on the quad. Can’t miss it” said a guy walking past.   “Thanks” said Lonnie taking the papers and jogging off.   “I’ll meet you back here for dinner!” you shouted.  “Yeah see ya!” he said running off. You shook your head the guy smiling.  “It’s a great school. He’ll like it here” said the young guy. You smiled taking a deep breath. “First one?”  “Hm?”  “First kid at college?” You narrowed your eyes and dropped your jaw the guy swallowing.  “You think I’m his mom? I’m his sister. He was being sarcastic.” You scoffed and headed back for the parking lot the guy groaning. “Yeah I look old enough to be his mother thanks a lot.”  “No no I was thinking must have been a teen…” he trailed off as you spun around. “Preg…”  “Oh so I’m not older just a teen mom. Got it.”   “Sorry” he said. “I just…sorry.” He took off past you and you calmed down for a minute before walking to your car. You had to laugh when you saw the guy kicking a flat tire at the car next to yours. He looked up and sighed. “Today’s not my day.”  “It’s fine. I get it” you said tossing a few empty boxes in the back of your SUV. “Lonnie is my kid brother. I take care of him.”  “I got a little brother myself. He’s in the law school here.”  “Moving him in?”  “No. I uh I work here. Worked here” he said. “Department cuts.”  “For how much they’re charging tuition I would hope that’s not true.”  “Didn’t like the job very much anyways” he said.   “You need a ride or…”  “Nah I got a spare in the trunk. Like I said just not my day.”  “Well I have a feeling my brother is ditching me for dinner tonight. First round’s on me for your shitty day.”  “I’m the one that should be buying you one after assuming.”  “You can buy me one after. Unless you’re gonna call me old again.” He smiled cocking his head. “Don’t push it.”  “Elk Tavern has some pretty good food.”  “Elk Tavern is a very nice restaurant.”  “Good. So you’re local.”  “Never said I wasn’t. There you go assuming things again pretty boy.”  “I assume we can get that drink over dinner?” You rolled your eyes leaning back against your car. “Come on. At least my day won’t be completely shitty that way.”  “Alright. Elk Tavern. Eight.” You started to turn and head towards the door when you paused. “Put the reservation under Impala.”  He smirked stepping aside as you backed out.   “What’s your number? Or you know name” he asked when you shifted into drive. You smiled the guy raising an eyebrow. “Oh that’s how you’re gonna play it?”  “If you want the answer to that you better fix that tire in time for your date.”  “Alright sassy. But I want that number after you inevitably fall for my charm tonight. Deal?”  “You got a deal casanova” you laughed. “See you later.”  “Not such a crappy day after all” he said before you drove off grinning.  _______,2024-07-14 16:50:27 GMT

Watching how Cas never looks scared or sad or disappointed or like he’s expecting a response from Dean.  “I’d like to plan out my part in this/But you’re such a narcissist/You’ll probably do it next week/I don’t get a choice in the matter/Why would I? It’s only the death of me” This is Dean reflecting on the confession. Dean suppresses every feeling until it becomes anger so of course he is angry about Cas’ choice. He wishes he had a choice in what happened the opportunity to react to what Cas is saying or try and change the outcome of the situation but he didn’t because Cas made his decision and in making that decision he made Dean’s for him as well. And because Dean can’t tell Cas how he feels or save him he feels like he died right alongside him.  “The death of me was so quiet/No friends and family allowed/Only my murderer you and the priest/Who told you to go to Hell” This is Dean after Cas’ death. He is the only one who knows what Cas’ sacrifice was the only one who truly knows what happened and what Cas gave for him. To everyone else Cas’ death was quiet and uneventful. But it killed Dean watching Cas die killed him in one way or another.  “And the funny thing is I would’ve married you/If you’d have stuck around/I feel more free than I have in years/Six feet in the ground” This is Dean letting himself die on that rebar in the finale. He wanted to spend the rest of his life with Cas whether he has admitted to himself if that’s romantic or friendship and he can’t imagine living the rest of his life without him. As he dies he finally feels free from his guilt and his grief. He thinks he might get to see Cas again.,2024-07-14 18:58:51 GMT

24,Supernatural,['ugh just listen to it i’m screaming'  "why is the line “and the funny thing is i would have married you if you'd have stuck around” the most tragic line ever"  'dean winchester'  'spn'  'spn fandom'  'spn season 15'  '15.18'  'despair'  '15.18 despair'  'supernatural fandom'  'castiel'  'destiel'  'deancas'  'dean x cas'  'casdean'  'cas x dean'  'doomsday lizzy mcalpine'  'lizzy mcalpine'],lovealwayssay,Doomsday by Lizzy McAlpine is literally Cas sacrificing himself for Dean and then Dean letting himself die a month later on that piece of rebar.  “Doomsday is close at hand/I’ll book the marching band/To play as you speak&quot; is Billie chasing Dean and Cas through the bunker both of them knowing they don’t have a way out of the situation.  “I’ll feel like throwin’ up/You’ll sit and stare/Like a goddamn machine” is Dean watching Cas confess to him knowing that it’s a goodbye and unable to stop it. Watching how Cas never looks scared or sad or disappointed or like he’s expecting a response from Dean.  “I’d like to plan out my part in this/But you’re such a narcissist/You’ll probably do it next week/I don’t get a choice in the matter/Why would I? It’s only the death of me” This is Dean reflecting on the confession. Dean suppresses every feeling until it becomes anger so of course he is angry about Cas’ choice. He wishes he had a choice in what happened the opportunity to react to what Cas is saying or try and change the outcome of the situation but he didn’t because Cas made his decision and in making that decision he made Dean’s for him as well. And because Dean can’t tell Cas how he feels or save him he feels like he died right alongside him.  “The death of me was so quiet/No friends and family allowed/Only my murderer you and the priest/Who told you to go to Hell” This is Dean after Cas’ death. He is the only one who knows what Cas’ sacrifice was the only one who truly knows what happened and what Cas gave for him. To everyone else Cas’ death was quiet and uneventful. But it killed Dean watching Cas die killed him in one way or another.  “And the funny thing is I would’ve married you/If you’d have stuck around/I feel more free than I have in years/Six feet in the ground” This is Dean letting himself die on that rebar in the finale. He wanted to spend the rest of his life with Cas whether he has admitted to himself if that’s romantic or friendship and he can’t imagine living the rest of his life without him. As he dies he finally feels free from his guilt and his grief. He thinks he might get to see Cas again.,2024-07-14 18:58:51 GMT

GTFO! First time we see Sam believing in ‘if there’s bad out there there must be good too’ Familiar faces: the receptionist at the hospital is the same actress who plays the angel Hannah in S8. The teacher at the pool is the veterinarian Toni Bevell pays to treat Sam’s gunshot wound in S12. Layla’s mother is Dr. Hess the headmistress of BMoL in S12 the delimma of choice: Layla’s life vs doing the greater good Dean gets pissed at Sam for taking him to a healer who using reaper to trade lives. In Sam’s defence he didn’t know about it until after Dean was healed. Mind you Sam did this out his faith in there being some good out there. But in later seasons Dean does reckless things to save Sam and that’s okay because he cares?! Hell no! Dean you gotta follow what you preach man! Tarot black altar and dark magic! Yes! Yes! Yes! Why did SPN decide to change a wrinkly grim looking perfect reaper to pretty women in later seasons?! No!
