18,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'alicent hightower'  'criston cole'  'olivia cooke'  'fabien frankel'  'helaena targaryen'  'phia saban'  'alicole'  'daeron targaryen'],strawberrycarat,Also rewatching the episodes I’ve been realize I really don’t care about AlicentxCole (since in real life people who think have the highest moral ends up being super hypocrite ) what it bothers me is truly the timing.   Like in ep. 1. It would’ve been more impactant the last scene IF they didn’t showed us in the middle Criston going down on Alicent (it would’ve been a plot twist - but we already knew so it only took protagonism from Helaena and Jaehaerys)  In ep. 2. Was it really necessary to end up with that couple (AGAIN) ? It would’ve been more touching to see Aegon crying and Alicent trying to get close to him but been unable to give comfort to her son (and that would’ve been cool as an ending)  Also hopefully the rumours are not true (regarding Daeron’s parentage because it wouldn’t make sense since Daeron is a dragon rider) and hopefully they don’t add a possible pregnancy plot with Alicent 😫,2024-07-07 20:56:56 GMT
1,House of the Dragon,['i have a hard time watching shows with genuinely disgusting people'  'he makes my stomach hurt'  'garbage human -1000/10'  'house of dragon spoilers'],morehoarbehaviof,i’m watching the new season and i would just like to reiterate that i HATE Ser Cristin Cole. I think he’s a disgusting sack of flesh that projects his own issues with his “purity”onto others. he holds on so desperately to an image of what he wishes he could be but knows that he isn’t. he’s disgusting. throw the whole thing away.,2024-07-07 20:52:55 GMT
160,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'aemond targaryen'],livmondcole,Confirmed that what Aemond drank in the brothel was poppy milk. I always knew it it’s the first theory/assumption I got right. Good that they have clarified this it has given rise to many different opinions. This is quite interesting does he take it for himself to open up emotionally or is it given to him to calm him down and keep him under control?,2024-07-07 20:52:33 GMT
25,House of the Dragon,['crazy fan theory'  'hotd'  'ewan mitchell'  'aemond targaryen'  'matt smith'  'daemon targaryen'  'alys rivers'  'gayle rankin'],strawberrycarat,I was re watching the last episode and I got a crazy fan theory.   What if Alys Rivers deceives Daemon and ends up sleeping with him? When Aemond comes and takes her as a war prize she deceives him too and tells him it’s his child (it’s Deamon’s) so he ends up trusting her and she leads him to his death (with Daemon in God’s eye battle)  THEN! What if Viserys is truly dead in the series after the attack? (Rhaenyra and Daemon’s son) if he truly gets lost in the sea AND Alys awaits for Aegon to claim the throne and she makes her son seem as Viserys? Then Daenerys bloodline would come from Daemon and Alys,2024-07-07 20:50:45 GMT

They show up for a plot beat then disappear again to the point that you’d never know some major characters have dragons they have significant bonds with.  GoT ignores the whole ‘winter is coming’ plot as long as it can then takes care of it in a single episode for the iron throne plot   You have magic! The gods are real! There are motherfucking dragons! You can have a gritty fantasy that still enjoys the fantastical elements I promise you.,2024-07-07 20:47:08 GMT

Over time their friendship changed but since they never had the courage to admit their feelings they gradually began to distance themselves from each other. When Jacaerys is promised to Baela their relationship is no longer the same. They both blame each other for what happened and continue to minimize their interactions until their father promises her hand in marriage to someone else.‟  A/N: Request written by anon. A very interesting concept that I thoroughly enjoyed writing.  Please remember that english is not my native language I do not use it on a daily basis so mistakes can or will happen.  Work contains smut so minors do not interact.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; -Since she found out  she has not spoken a word to me…she hates me - the young prince lamented to his mother  Princess Rhaenyra  who watched him carefully  furrowing her eyebrows in consternation.  -You yourself said that you have hatred for her  why now your indifference to her has changed so drastically? - his mother remarked looking for every single emotion that bubbled up inside him wanting to understand what was hidden in the mind of her eldest son.  -I never hated her - he denied  closing his eyes and sighing heavily  frustrated -She is the one who hates me. She barely talks to me  and when she does it’s as if ice falls out of her mouth instead of words.  -And why that bothers you now my sweet boy? - Rhaenyra said softly coming up to him and putting her hand on his shoulder - What happened that now  so suddenly you crave her attention and acceptance?  Jacaerys was silent for a while looking into the distance through the chamber window. Eventually he turned to his mother his eyes filled with helplessness and anger  which slowly took control over his body.  He wanted to scream  he wanted to break everything within his reach and turn it into dust. But he did nothing and without a word  he walked away.  His steps were rapid  almost violent and hard. He walked through the corridors of Dragonstone as if the beast possessed his flesh  leaving behind a raw anger and tension that made the air heavier. And before he could chase away the fog that clouded his mind  he found himself in the chamber of his sister - Y/n Velaryon.  His dark eyes wandered involuntarily through the empty chamber  while his hands touched things that belonged to her. Stuck in an ocean of memories  he paused at the wooden desk his fingers gliding over the material adorning the covers of old books  some closed  some open on pages  which she had read many times along with him  when they were still full of innocence.  He let himself remember  until his gaze rested on a piece of paper hidden between the pages. And before he could think about the subsequent consequences and implications  his hand uncover a letter  a letter regarding her…and the betrothal with Samwell Blackwood’s son.  -Why are you here? - suddenly a female voice called out  a voice belonging to his younger sister  who was standing in the threshold of the chambers  looking at him  frowning her eyebrows.  -You can’t marry him - he said  looking at her like an enraged animal ignoring her question - You can’t - he repeated his body yet again being controlled by anger.  Her eyes rested on the paper  that was held by the young man in a disturbingly strong grip.  -How dare you tell me what to do? - she asked him  her voice dangerously cold -How dare you?!  -I dare to tell you what to do because I am your brother -he growled  clenching his hand into a fist  in which there was a letter.  -Brother? - she made an ironic sound - Our mother may have taken me under her care and raised me as her own but that does not mean that you are my brother no brother should be indifferent cruel and cold as you are - she stated and every word she spoke sounded like a sea of daggers that were cutting his body.  Jacaerys moved towards her trapping her between the heavy wooden door and her own body.  -You talk about coldness and indifference? You are a hypocrite - he muttered furrowing his thick eyebrows in annoyance - You are the one who destroyed the bond we once had. From the moment Baela was promised to me you decided to destroy everything that was between us.  -If this is what you think - she scoffed her eyes and voice devoid of emotions - If I make you so unhappy you should be glad that I’m leaving for the Riverlands. You won’t have to listen to me anymore you won’t have to see me.  -Do you truly think that’s far enough? Do you think that there is a corner of this Earth that you could travel to far away enough to free me from this torment? - he muttered  looking into her siren eyes that seemed to draw him in.  They were both breathing harshly  words hanging heavy between them.  -What do you want me to do? - she whispered feeling the air between them getting hotter -What do you want me to do to end your torment? - she asked  looking at him with misty eyes.  -I want you…to be mine - he replied - From the moment you let me touch your soft skin from the moment you let me hear your voice from the moment you let me admire your beautiful face I wanted you to be mine. Please dear sister  please let me be mine. Don’t leave me just be mine and I will be yours.  In response the woman embraced his jaw with her warm palm and moving closer to him she let her full lips brush his.  -Nyke emagon va moriot issare aōhon Jacaerys (I have always been yours Jacaerys) - she confessed quietly  closing her eyes as his lips began to press against hers  desperate to feel her even closer  even more intensely.  Wet kisses spread over her lips  cheeks and jawline  leaving a trail of saliva behind. Jacaerys kissed her everywhere he could  marking her face with his mouth.  They were both needy  oh so needy. Every touch  every caress every whimper  every moan was more desperate than the last.  -Jaes ao yknagon sīr sȳz (Gods you smell so good) - he muttered  moving his nose along her neck  taking in the scent of the oils she sprinkled on her body and the sweat that had managed to appear on her skin through the heat she was in -Ao sylutegon sȳz tolī issa dōna mandia sīr sȳz (You taste good too my sweet sister  so good) - he whispered in the hollow of her neck  licking and biting her pulse  while his long fingers  lazily hooked into the black fabric of her dress  letting it fall from her shoulders  revealing her firm  ample breasts.  -Oh Jacaerys - she mewled  embracing his head entwining her fingertips between his wavy hair pulling at its ends drawing him closer to her -Don’t stop…please don’t stop touching me.  -Dōrī (Never) - he breathed out into her mouth  before he attacked her naked breasts  his tongue swirling around the hardened nipples  sucking them and tasting them with his tongue like a man starved.  Y/n moaned quietly  closing her eyes and surrendering to the feeling of a man’s mouth on her skin and hands that sensually glided over her thighs  pulling the dark material up  revealing the material of her delicate undergarments.  -Jacaerys - she whimpered  watching as he sank to his knees in front of her.  -Will you let me taste you? - he asked  with rough fingers gliding along her smooth legs  stopping at her rounded hips  revealing her wet  swollen womanhood.  -Yes  yes  yes - she whispered  closing her eyes and tilting her head.  He was gentle and painfully slow kissing and sucking her firm skin leaving marks on her flesh as he got closer and closer to where she needed him the most.  She quickly fell into numbness. The amount of attention she was receiving seemed to overwhelm her body but even so she didn’t want the moment to ever end not with Jacaerys tormenting her womanhood in such an addictive way. She could compare him to a hungry animal  by the fact with what fervor he devoured her femininity sampling every piece not wanting to miss absolutely anything. She let the knot in her lower abdomen burst spreading through her body the delightful and burning pleasure that was constantly coursing through her veins through the tongue of a man who refused to leave her feasting on her even longer.  -Please let me feel you closer. I need you closer  closer than you have ever been - he groaned  embracing her frame  securing it in his strong arms and moving them so that he rested on the bed behind them placing Y/n on his strong legs immediately proceeding to attack her neck with slow kisses while his hands crept to her throbbing entrance which was waiting for him embracing him tightly as he inserted two fingers into her sensually moving them.  -Whatever you want  I’ll give you whatever you want. But I beg you  don’t make me wait my dear brother…I beg you. I need you as you need me…closer than we everwere - she whispered into his mouth  leaning her head towards his.  She moaned wrapping her arms around his shoulders as Jacaerys removed his fingers from her tight canal  replacing them with his thick and veiny shaft that penetrated her gummy walls making her hide her face in the hollow of his neck moaning and panting as she felt her brother pushing inside her for the first time kissing her cervix with his member giving her incredible pleasure and pain that only increased her desire.  He tried to be gentle and slow but the nails digging into his back the melodious moans at his ear and the warmth of his sweet sister’s body made him rough  almost violent  taking advantage of her trembling body  which seemed to melt into his.  -Ñuha jorrāelagon (My beloved) - Y/n whined  feeling the recently discovered pleasure grow in her lower abdomen forming another knot ready to burst at any moment.  -Ivestragon nyke iksā ñuhon (Tell me you’re mine) - the prince growled thrusting into her harder making her feel as if his manhood was deep in her belly.  -Iksan aōhon iksan aōhon mērī aōhon! (I’m yours I’m yours only yours!) - Y/n announced grabbing his wavy curls pulling them tight as an electrifying sensation went through her body making her almost blind with pleasure.  -Arlī  ivestragon ziry arlī (Again  say it again) - he demanded attacking her neck.  -Iksan aōhon (I am yours) - she repeated bringing their foreheads together.  Yours. Yours. Yours.  After everything she was finally his.,2024-07-07 20:38:19 GMT

ALSO daddy daemon is coming soon…..xoxo   “I’m glad you could join us” Daella said with a hint of mischief in her eyes as she stared down Aemond.   Aemond chuckled. “of course I couldn’t let my nephew have all the fun and the vale.” he said his voice dripping with sarcasm.   Daella noticed the tension between the two: “Sit make yourselves comfortable.” She gestured to her couches near the hearth. “The ladies brought tea but I figured we might need something much stronger to get through the night together” Daella said as she pushed the heavy chest in front of her bed and pulled back the carpet dislodging a loose stone and pulling out a wooden box. “Strongwine.” She presented handing the bottle to Aemond to open. Daella quickly put everything back before settling down with the two princes. “I apologize for the lack of chalices.” She said while pouring the wine into tea cups. Her robe had slid open a bit allowing Aemond a peak at her ample breast. “It’s not a problem” Jacearys reassured as Aemond rolled his eye.  They all took their respective cups as Daella tried to cut through the tension avoiding any mention of the alliance. She asked more superficial questions trying to get to know one another such as when she danced with Jacearys alone. As they continued to drink through the night the strongwine began to chip away at both their facades.   In a fit of laughter Daella accidentally spilled her wine on herself and Jaceary’s nightshirt causing it to stick to his body and showcasing all of the chiseled curves he hid underneath. “I’m so sorry.” She gasped as she tried to reach for a towel in her drunken stupor. She stumbled forward landing in Aemonds lap. She froze for a moment studying his face the flames flickering on his face making him look so inviting. Daella could feel his breathing stall as his eye flickered down to her lips and back up to her eyes. She turned to look over to Jacearys beaconing to sit beside them.   Jacearys would have declined or even left the room but he wasn’t sure if it was the emotions of the night mixed with the strongwine or if it was just the way her amber eyes had a hold on him but he rose from his seat and took his place beside her. “I want you both” she admitted in a whisper looking between the two princes. The two males looked at one another in silent agreement. “Then take us” Jacearys whispered in her ear causing Daella to lose all sense of self as she crashed her lips into Jacearys; it was a heated kiss full of urgency and hidden dark desires. Daella moaned in his mouth as Aemond began to kiss the exposed skin on her neck. Aemond explored her body with his hands tugging on her robe exposing her pert nipples. He gently took one in his hand eliciting another moan from her. “Such pretty moans” Jacearys whispered against her lips and he began to lift her nightdress exposing her slick cunt as he stared at her mischievously. He grabbed her face as he ran his fingers up and down her slit and a gasp escaped her as he slid a finger in. No man had ever dared to touch her in this way and chills covered her body as the two worked on the different parts of her. Daella could feel Aemond growing under her and his hips thrust forward a bit hoping to relieve some of the pressure that was building in his trousers. Jacearys continued to curl his fingers inside of her as he entered a second finger in search of that soft spot that made her head go blank his trousers now suddenly feeling too tight. Della wrapped her fingers in Aemonds hair tugging slightly as a gasp tore through her lips when Jacearys found that spot hidden inside her. Aemond groaned at her slight tugs; desperate to switch off with Jacearys he tore her away from him. Daella hissed as Jacerys fingers pulled away from her so abruptly. Aemond pushed her back and lifted her knees exposing herself to him as he stared at her glistening heat with desire. “I wish to touch you.” She whispered “In time.” Aemond mumbled against her inner thigh as he peppered kisses along until he plunged himself into her core lapping away like a man who had never drunk before. Her back arched in response and Jacearys began to hold her down as he worked on her breast. Daella could feel a heat growing within her as she bit her lip desperate to keep quiet but with every stroke and kiss her climax came closer. “Fuck me” She cried. The orgasm ran from the roots of her hair down to the very edge of her toes. Her thighs were shaking her arms shaking her entire body was shaking.  Aemond smirked in satisfaction her slick covering his face. “Sweeter than the finest wines.” he chuckled standing to clean himself up. Daella rested her head against Jacerys chest as she tried to steady her heartbeat. His strong arms pulled her closer to him while he placed a kiss on her head.   “Take off your clothes” she said confidently standing up. “Both of you.” the two males quickly got to work removing the little clothes left while Daella removed her now-soiled night dress. The three stood bare before each other as Daella pushed them to her bed. She spit in her palms as she wrapped her hands along their throbbing cocks. Once again the room was filled with moans and groans as Daella worked on the two princes invoking orgasm after orgasm from the two males.   Eventually their bodies were spent as they lay in her bed a tangled mess of legs and limbs with Jacearys nuzzled in her neck and Aemond finding solace amongst her breast. “We should go.” Jacearys tried to reason as his drunkenness began to wear off.   “Stay” Daella commanded gripping his arm and pulling Aemond closer. “If someone finds us here they will question your virtue.” Aemond agreed with Jacearys.   Daella sighed her selfishness and desire winning over her logic “fuck virtue.”   Taglist: @damewritesalot,2024-07-07 20:33:55 GMT

21,House of the Dragon,['princess rhaenys targaryen'  'rhaenyra x daemon'  'alicent hightower'  'team black'  'team green'  'hotd'  'hotd season 2'],fueledpurelybyspite,My hot take regarding house of the dragon is that there is no way of hating Alicent without hating Rhaenyra and vice versa. You cannot say Alicent is better because she did her duty while Rhaenyra did what she liked without consequences without implying that it was fair for Alicent to be subjected to marital rape and forced pregnancy because it was just her duty and she did as she was bid. You cannot say that without implying that a girl experimenting and wanting to have her first experiences with someone she actually was attracted to without being held down by the imposition of marriage (like any man could do) like Rhaenyra did was wrong. ‘Rhaenyra wants to put bastards on the throne’ what was she to do when she was forced to marry even tho she had no interest to and was terrified of childbirth? Laenor is gay was she supposed to rape him? To reveal his sexuality and bring shame on him and his family?

His wife. In favour of her.  You didn’t know who she was were he met or if she lived in the keep or in flea bottom.  All you knew is that he spent night after night alone with her.  He would come back smelling of wine and her perfume.  The smell seeping into your bedsheets.  The bed he insisted on sharing  even after fucking another woman.  After calling you ugly.  saying he never would have chosen you not for your brain and certainly not your looks.  It wasn’t that you were ugly. Just that your hair was untamed your clothes never quite fitting right.  It was the little things he picked on insecurities you had noticed time and time again. And though you had strived to change these insecurities. Spending the crowns money on dresses from the best dressmakers on hair oils from Essos. Aemond still found a way to make you feel insecure.  He loved to point out the insecurities loved to belittle you loved to bring to light insecurities you never knew you had.  You had been married nearly three years now had provided him with both a son and daughter and yet to him you were still not enough.  The words of love and kindness he once gave you in the first few months of your marriage vanished. And in said cruel tormenting words replaced them.  Instead those sweet words were now given to her.  And you were left all alone.  But a scorned woman is not a quite one you did not shout or argue with him no. you set your sights elsewhere.  To the man you had once know and loved the man you had met before him. The man you had once longed to marry in Aemond’s stead.  His uncle Gwayne Hightower.  Had your parents not craved status and the ideas of their grandchildren and princes and princess you might have been able to marry him.  You were a daughter of house Redwyne a noble house known for its fleet and riches.  And though you had grown up in the Arbor your family had sent you away to Oldtown when you became of age to win the favour of Otto Hightower and the potential match between you and one of his Targaryen grandchildren.  And though it had worked with you being summoned by him to kings landing where you found yourself courting your now husband Prince Aemond.  Though you had first found yourself besotted with Gwayne.  A dashing knight who had crowned you the queen of love and beauty at your first ever tourney.  He had won your heart only for it to be swiftly pulled form his grasp as you were summoned to kings landing on by Otto hightower.  You had never truly forgotten about him even in the years you had gone since seeing him.  Then your wedding came and as uncle of the groom of course he came.  And throughout the whole ceremony your eyes were drawn to his wishing it was him you were saying your vows to.  But as fleeting as your love for him was so was his presence. For he swiftly left after the wedding.  But not before whispering the words you had dreamed of hearing.  you swiftly found yourself married to an insecure man who had too found himself a place in your heart however small.  In those three years since your wedding three years since you had seen him. You had thought you had grown to love…if not care for your husband.  And you had thought he had to the words “I love you” really selling his lies. And now he betrayed you night after night.  It hurt and gods were you angry.  Everyone knew of his infidelity.  His lust for this other woman.  And though you didn’t know of it not truly. For all you wished to do was deny it.  Doing everything in your power to imagine another reason for his disappearance for his wine-soaked lips and rose scented body.  His drunken remakes about your appearance how he hated your hair your eyes. How you weren’t her.  Then as time passed the remakes turned hateful as if you were keeping him from her.  And so the once words of beauty and love turned to ugly hate.  You had tried to not believe his remarks  Hoping that a apart of him only craved an old love just as you did.  Then Aegon came into your room drunk in grief and yet finding so much humour in your husband’s affair he could barley get the words out.  He and laughed and laughed until he saw the tears in his sister in laws face.  He had regretted it instantly though you could tell he still found humour in Aemond’s actions.  He claimed it was the woman he paid for Aemond to lose his virginity too how she must have such a hold on him after all these years.  And as he watched the silent angry tears fall from your face he had run out of the room apologising as he did.  A week passed since then.  War was declared.  Lords and knight arriving preparing for orders.  One knight in particular arrived Gwayne Hightower.  You watched as he rode into the red keep.  His tired raged yet no less handsome form jumping of his horse.  His sister the queen greeting him.  You had raced down the steps far to egar to see him.  And yet it all seemed to happen in slow motion.  His eye turning to you. A soft smile filling his face.  He bowed slightly smiling even more as you returned with your own.  Lifting your hand to his mouth in a slow gentle kiss.  Your eyes never leaving the others.  A cough had broken your hazes his hand still clasping yours as you both turned to Alicent.  “Daughter” she greeted her gaze questioning as she took you both in.  There was a fair age difference between you both though you were older than Aemond Gwayne was still years your senior. You were sure to Alicent it must seem strange almost how close you seemed close enough to greet him to smile and kiss each others hand.  “You know my brother?” she asked her gaze never leaving your joined hands.  You slowly separated your hand from his though the slight caress of your fingers was sure to raise Alicent’s eyebrow’s.  “Yes from my years in old town” you said finally breaking eye contact with Gwayne.  “ah” she said uncertain of what to make of your friendship with one another “I am glad my brother has another friendly face here at court.”  “As am I” Gwayne mused “it has been years since I last saw you my lady.”  “Since the wedding I believe” Alicent interjected finding the need to remined you both of your marital status.  “Ah yes how is my nephew?” he asked eyes fixed on your face taking in every emotion passing between your eyes.  “I don’t know ser may haps you should check the brothels and tell me yourself” you said glancing to Alicent to see her reaction.  She pierced her lips seemingly shocked at the notion “I am sure that- “  “ask the king if you must I learnt it from him though the wine and perfume was more than another hint for me” you mused turning back to Gwayne “I shall show you to your chambers ser” you said before Alicent could say anything more in the matter.  Lacing your arm through his you weaved your way through the red keep. Finding your conversations never ending as if no time had passed at all.  “I have missed you” you breathed as you entered his chambers.  Finally alone after all these years.  He smiled a true smile one that he only reserved for you.  Though there was some trepidation uncertainty in his gaze.  As if he knew that despite having you first being your first everything you would never be his.  “I am sure no more that I have” he mused.  “I doubt that” you whispered sadness clear in your tone.  “What do you mean?” he said scowling “has my nephew done something?”  “i-“ you were unsure of what to say.  It had been years since you had seen him. And though you had sent letters back and forth they were restrained. Finding it hard to talk as you once did be as open as you once had.  But as you looked at him you saw everything you had ever craved ever desired. Everything you had been deprived of for three long years.  “what” he prompted moving closer to you.  “he is cruel…he has a lover in the city and only hates me for not being her” you sneered.  “And do you hate him?” he asked his hand reaching for yours once again.   “I resent him…but I understand him. He only treats me how I wish I could treat him; he says the words I crave to say to him act the way I crave to act…with you” you said your faces so close that you were sharing your breaths.  “I never stopped wishing I had stolen you away that night married you in his stead” he breathed “I hate that he Is cruel…I j=had hoped you found love in his arms not hatred… I cannot but feel guilty” he said his mouth kissing the corner of yours.  “We should have ran away…gotten married for love and ran from our duty” you agreed as he peppered kisses down your neck his breath caressing your skin.  He hummed against your neck his fingers playing with the laces on your back.  “please” you begged moving his arm to grasp you to pull you close to him.  Unlacing your dress he started to pepper kisses down your chest.  “gods I missed this sight” he groaned kissing around your breasts.  You were insecure having had two children and year of belittling on your appearance. You went to cover yourself only for Gwayne to tear your arms away from you pinning them behind your back as he stripped the remained of your clothes off of you.  He descended down your body leaving hot kisses as he went until he finally reached your wet cunt.  He gave a slow tortuous lick through your folds.  Groaning at the taste of you he moved his head further into your thighs  locking and tasting your cunt like you were his last meal.  moaning in pleasure your hands moved from his hold and reached down to clutch to grip his hair tightening when he finally found your bud.  Focusing is efforts on your small bud of nerves he sucked and licked at your bud slowly bringing his fingers to your entrance.  Slowly pushing into you your cunt hot and tight from a year of neglect.  Your hips ground themselves against his face soon loosing yourself to the pleasure as he pumped his fingers in and out of you.  You peaked as his third finger entered you. The pleasure overwhelming and near too much as he continued to lap up your juices as you peaked all over his face.  Finaly moving from your thighs he backed away from you moving to stand before pushing you down onto his bed.  Standing back from you he ever so slowly took of his own clothes revelling his toned chest and his hard thick cock.  Slowly crawling onto the bed his body covering yours he finally took your lips with his.  Your first kiss with him in years.  It was hot messy and desperate.  Everything you needed craved and loved.  His tongue danced with yours as he pulled your legs apart positioning himself between your thighs.  He pulled back from your lips his eyes connecting with yours as he slowly pushed in side.  He filled you in a way Aemond never had his cock hitting that one spot of nerves only he had ever found again and again as he thrusted his hips into you.  He moved to kiss you once more his hips pumping faster and faster as he did.  You had never felt so perfect so lost in pleasure as the sweet spot was hit over and over again.  Your second peak fast approaching and you had turned into a moaning mess.  Grasping desperate to him as you both peaked and he spilled his seed inside you.  Your breaths were heavy your bodies still attacked as you both effused to leave the others hold.  That as until the door open and her husband strolled in.  “uncle-“ he started clearing coming to greet Gwayne only to find you in his arms “wife?!” he sneered.  Gwayne moved to stand covering himself quickly as he moved to hide you from Aemond “nephew! How delightful!” he said in mock joy.  “what is she doing here?” he sneered eyes darting around Gwayne body trying to reach your eyes.  “what is it to you?” Gwayne drawled.  “she is my wife!”  “is she?” Gwayne laughed “then perhaps you should treat her as such and not leave her to run of with your little whores!” Gwayne said tone filled with rage.  Of course he knew of Aemodsn doing of his treatment of his sweet lady his siter had told him ashamed of both her sons treatment of their wives.  And even if she hadn’t told him the rumours of Aemond’s affairs had long travelled to the reach.  “you forget yourself!”  “I do not you have treated her like a whore! As if she is worth nothing when she is worth the world!”  “so you fucked her because I am such a bad husband?” Aemond sneered his eyes gleaming with rage.  “gods are you that vain? This has nothing to do with you Aemond” you interjected.  “Nothing? Nothing to do with me? You are my wife!”  “I am not a broodmare! I am not owned by you just because we are married!” you said standing from the bed only a sheet covering your body.  “then what? You mean to say you are in love” he said mockingly.  “yes” you both responded at the same time your eyes connecting and speaking in only a language you both spoke.  “you whore-” he started. But Gwayne acted fast landing a smooth and quick punch at Aemond. Knocking him clean out on the floor.  Your eyes locked in shock releasing what had happened and before you knew it your clothes were thrown on bags packed and your children in your arms as you ran and caught the first both to Essos.  Away from your husband and the gods forsaken war that would have only lead to your doom.     taglist  @apollonshootafar@flrboyd @theanxietyqueen17 @dark-night-sky-99@zillahvathek @leavesmealobe @winter-soldier-101 @bunbunbl0gs @ka1afbr @tesha-i-guess @aemondwhoresworld @RAYNE TARGARYEN 2 @littlebirdgot @eddieslut69 @beebeechaos @jennifer0305 @rosedurin @berightback1409 @barnes70stark @cloboboo @aegonswife   to be added to taglist,2024-07-07 21:08:57 GMT

Tully! Reader) Word Count: 6.4 K  Summary: Aemond goes to Harrenhal to learn more of the world instead he learns about love death and the odd world of ghosts.  Warnings: Mentions of death drowning ghosts light mentions of suicide blood it’s low key giving Greek Tragedy but with a happy ending!  Everyone was painfully aware that Harrenhall was haunted. The whispers in the walls the ominous things spoken in the dark books moved and wailing carried by the winds. But in Aemond’s mind what could a ghost do to him? There was no physical body no pain to be caused perhaps some sadness in seeing corpses walk but he was confident in his ability to navigate. He simply wished to take some books and learn some new things of the world. The world that he wished to rule one day. And his mother had convinced him that this was an honor for him to be invited in the first place. He was fantastic in his studies and his mother was proud of that.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; He didn’t have looks that could get him anywhere so from a young age when his face was sewn back together he knew he would have to compensate for it. He read and read and read every book from front to back had his own personal copies commissioned so he could write in the margins. He learned of the plants and the fish war strategy histories and philosophies. Only to find out that most Lords didn’t care to discuss such things.   It seemed most men were more interested in ladies and whores and wine. That and the weather. The gods forsaken weather. But the moment he tried to bring up cloud formations odd looks were shot his way. The one positive however was that Grover Tully had heard of his habits and sent an invite for him to come to Harrenhal for some days to study the rich history and plant diversity. There was no question about whether he would go his grip on his reins tight as Vhagar slid across the rocky ground. The air was wet and smelled of things he could not identify and yet he was excited to learn marching his way up to the castle that was once grand.   It was still the largest yes but there were leaks and cracks and full chunks missing. He couldn’t imagine what it would be like to sleep inside to have water trickle into your room and bats tap against your walls. But soon he wouldn’t have to imagine going right up to one of the holes and sliding in. It was dark and the air felt thick and warm with light. He followed the candles and smiled from the corridor as he saw the Lords and his daughters in the Great Hall waiting for his arrival. “Ah I see I used the wrong entrance” He called out making them jump. And to his delight they seemed to find humor in his words.   “Ah Prince Aemond! I am glad you could make it” Lord Tully was kinder than expected. His eye narrowed and he was hunting for undertones. For violence or perhaps teasing. He knew the game of court and he knew the way of tongues. And he knew that when most people spoke they did not truly mean the words that escaped them. But this old man he was all chuckles and drunkenness. A little tipsy as he stumbled to the dining table.    “Please join us for our evening meal!” He called out waving him over. He was hesitant for a moment and as he walked he could swear that he felt footsteps beside him copying him holding him. He tried not to look but after a moment he glanced over. And though he could see nothing- no this was his brain playing tricks on him. He had read about this the placebo effect. If he truly believed the place was haunted he would begin to feel things to hear things that were not there at all. Clearing his throat he sat at the first seat available. Lord Tully had three daughters and they looked similar to him. Slightly masculine in nature their shoulders wide and their features strong but there was a sweetness.   He could believe they were triplets if he were told. They had curls of ginger that rippled out like waves of the sea and jewelry on their fingers all of them matching. As he sat on the chair they looked at him a curl in their lips as if contemplating whether or not to speak. “Perhaps the Prince would like a different chair this one is far more comfortable” Lord Tully spoke a bit of tension in his voice. Aemond could tell that he had broken an unknown rule standing up and relocating.   “My apologies I was not made aware of your preference” He spoke his hands on the armrests.   “We should have informed you. That chair belonged to my late daughter (Y/N). We keep it open for her” The thought saddened him but he tried not to show it on his face. He tried to think of what that would be like. Despite living with his family he felt that he was greatly distanced from them. He and Aegon did not speak often. Sometimes Aegon would speak to him but only to taunt and ask for coin when he ran out. He liked Helaena and sitting with her but she was not much of a chatterbox. Though they did share a connection he liked to think through the trauma they shared. He was pushed away for his looks whereas she was pushed away for her mind. He was close with his mother and not with his father and his uncle? Forget about it. But to see this family leaving a chair open for their dead kin. It touched him in a way.   “Of course” He nodded looking down at the meal that he was served. Fish buttery and flaky and smothered in bread crumbs to mask the flavor of the off season. Wine that was more bitter than what he was used to but he drank it anyway. He knew to respect the space and to nod as they asked him questions.    “Do you like being a Prince?” One of the ladies asked to which he nodded.    “Sometimes. I am very lucky I don’t know the feeling of an empty stomach or the pain of not having fine clothes. But the responsibilities are heavy and the court is boring” He smiled trying to coax out some laughter some approval from this group he would be spending his time with.   “So I hear that you read a lot. Have you ever considered writing anything of your own?” Lord Tully asked his mouth full of potato. Aemond thought about the question for a moment rolling it around in his head. “Perhaps one day. But I am now too young to be an expert on anything. And I am not much of a storyteller i’m afraid. I am more fascinated with history and science” He answered and as his eyes wandered the table he could swear that a figure filled the seat of the dead lady. He blinked and as his brows scrunched together his eye squinting she was still there. Her gown soft and white her eyes matching as they seemed to wander the room her face warm from the candle light.   “I’m sorry do you-” He paused staring at the table.   “Yes. She comes and goes as she pleases” One of the ladies spoke up and when he looked again she vanished. His heart thumped in ihs chest and he squirmed in discomfort. They were so casual about it and he held his breath in his cheeks.    “Oh. I- I see.” He mumbled quietly. He tried to ease his mind. Surely this was just a joke they were playing having one of their maids come and run away. He bent his head to look under the table to see if a jester was hiding beneath it. But there was nothing nothing but shoes and the ends of frilly skirts.   “So no writing for you then?” Lord Tully asked and he quickly shook his head.   “What do you think happens when we die? Do you believe in the Seven?” One of the ladies asked resting her face in her palms. They had a breathy way of speaking as if they had just ran all around.   “Yes my lady. I am quite passionate in my faith. I visit the Sept quite frequently with my mother and I have read the Seven Pointed Star more times than I can count on my fingers” He responded pridefully.   “Hm.” She hummed shortly. “It is all nonsense” She hummed softly putting her utensils down. “I am retiring for the night good night father!” She spoke and like ducklings her sisters followed giving their father a kiss on the forehead before rushing off to their chambers. He sat in awkward silence for a moment before the Lord spoke up.    “Do not mind them they are young and questioning things and mourning their sister” He said gently pouring himself a new chalice of wine. Aemond nodded folding his napkin over his plate rubbing his hands together.    “I understand. My father is not doing entirely well these days I feel as though my mother acts as though he is already gone” He admitted his face flushing. He did not know why he admitted it to a stranger nonetheless. Lord Tully nodded giving him an understanding smile.   “That is how it tends to be is it not? I mourned my (Y/N) long before she was gone” He said quietly and Aemond stared at him for a second trying to pick up more clues.   “And… how did your daughter die may I ask?” The words felt unnatural and his voice came out soft almost warm. Lord Tully did not seem the slightest bit uncomfortable as he responded. “A drowning incident. But there was so much more than that. I remember some weeks before her death she began to have a curiosity for the unknown. My daughter always wanted to write an epic story of the sea and i’ve searched aimlessly for whatever she may have. A page a sentence but I come back empty handed. I suppose she was on one of her adventures the late night or the early morning we will never know. But she washed up with afternoon tea. My eldest Mae went to fetch her for cake and cream. When they could not find her they went to her favorite spot It was her favorite because it was where the small stuff would wash up.   She couldnt be more than a few feet away from the most beautiful shell i’ve ever seen. She was facing the sky like she was only sunbathing. But to see her her tongue purple and her eyes open like that.. It is something that I will not live long enough to forget” He spoke his voice going melancholic before he suddenly pressed his palms against his table. “But enough about our suffering. How was your meal?” He asked. This family discussed death like the Lords spoke of the weather.   “Oh! It was very good. Is that- was that white fish?” he asked making the Lord chuckle.   “Cod! The finest of fish. I find it pairs best with orange wine but alas we have run out” He responded. “Now allow me to show you to the guest chambers. You are lucky it is right near the library. Feel free to read anything you want I only ask that you do not read and eat and do not take the old text outside the sun will bleach the pages” He said and Aemond nodded as he soaked up the information like a sponge. The chambers were.. Well they left much to be desired. There was a nice big bed a fire place a table to put his things a few bottles of water a small couch. But the trees screamed outside and rain drops flew in with the wind. There was an empty wardrobe dusty from lack of care.   “Thank you My Lord.” he spoke placing his things down. He preferred to travel light. A change of clothes some night wear a few extra eyepatches his own quill and journal to keep track of his studies. He sighed as he changed into his soft cotton night clothes- and as he looked in the mirror his heartbeat quickened as a hand touched his torso. He let out a loud sound whipping around to try and figure out what was there his hand wrapping around the handle of his dagger. He didn’t call out into the dark he stayed quiet as he inched toward the wardrobe pulling the wooden doors open. Nothing. Slowly he turned. He could feel something touching his hair his hand moving wildly through the strands trying to shake something out.   He could hear a giggle and when he turned he could finally see something. The soft silhouette of a woman going out the door except of course she did not open it- she simply went through it giggling down the hall. He could hear the pitter patter of her feet his mouth parted as he opened the door rushing down the hall trying to figure out where the creature was going. He wasn’t supposed to believe in all this but it was right before his eye. He could reach out and touch her if she let him. “Hello?” he called out trying to keep his voice calm. He slowly approached a door one that’s knob was becoming worn down from touches from going in and out. His fingers curved so naturally around it and he drew in a deep breath as he slowly opened it. It howled with a creak and he winced at the noise looking around as though someone would call him on his trespassing. He slowly made his way inside and he softened at the sight. It was brighter than the other rooms the walls splashed with blue and covered in small paintings lazy swirls and hand prints.    He lifted his hand to the dark blue paint biting his lip as he pressed his handprint over the one forever stained into the wall. His hand was much larger covering up the mark with the width of his palm. His brows scrunched together and he felt connected to it her whatever this entity was. Even if it was just for a moment. The giggle tickled his ears again and he turned his head to look at the bed. A shadow rested on it hidden by a sheer canopy seashells stitched into the fabric. He didn’t know what compelled him to move forward but before he knew it he was staring down at her and she was staring up at him. He pushed the fabric aside sitting down on the bed. It was soft squishy. “My Lady?” he whispered softly as the moon dragged across the blankets. The light made her show the outline of her nose the fuzzy halo of her hair. He was talking to the air to the mere idea of something. But he continued.   “Are you there?” He asked. Slowly he could see her becoming more solid. Becoming alive as the night aged as the stars twinkled in the sky and when the next breeze came he could feel her hair brushing his nose. He smiled faintly at the feeling reaching out to touch it. It felt like spun sugar weightless in his hands. He should be afraid. Of himself for being insane enough to see this. To believe it.    “Can you speak?” he asked. There was a soft hum and it echoed off the walls crawling into his ear and sliding across his brain.    “You are warm” Her voice felt like a song and he felt heat rising into his cheeks. He had read fables. Every culture seemed to have a different interpretation of the sleeping ladies. Women who killed themselves who were silenced in their lifetimes returning to whisper to lost souls and sleeping sailors. The Tully had drowned and yet as he looked at her now- she seemed enchanted. Like a mermaid hundreds of feet in the waves hair flowing around her skin tinted blue with the ocean. And yet her face remained full and her skin glowed. She was not frightening at all. And slowly she leaned closer.    “I am warm?” He repeated back to her reaching out his hand. He wanted to touch her to feel how cold her skin must be. To wonder if she really was as her sisters said still swimming in the sea.   “Yes. Like fire.” She whispered back and when their skin touched he felt a sting rush up his arm. Like a million needles penetrating his skin. He grunted yanking his hand back staring at it with a bewildered expression. Maybe ghosts could hurt. “It is alright” She whispered reaching out again. Her hands moved unnaturally as if they were flowing around like the tentacles of a jellyfish. “Please don’t hide from me” Her voice was melting him like butter and much to his displeasure he gave in. He let her run her cold hands along his nose over the base of his brows. “You are so beautiful. So alive.” She studied him like she had never seen a human being before smiling as she touched his hair.    “I would hope so” He said hesitantly getting a bit closer. “Are you the drowned lady?” He asked brows raised.    “Is that what they call me now?” She asked. He smiled she was teasing him. He could see dimples in her cheeks a slight tilt in his head. His mind wandered as he looked at her. She still came to her room she still haunted this house.   “Why are you here?” He asked.    “This is my room” She responded matter-of-factly. He smiled at her licking his lips as his eyes continued to wander. There were shells everywhere articles of clothing her wardrobe still parted. It was painted with light blue and pink and her socks were still on the floor with the muddy imprints of sand and toes. Her family probably hadn’t touched anything since she died. Including jars of water that were beginning to mold.   “I know that but.. Here in this realm. You aren’t in the Heavens or the Hells” He said softly. She hummed slowly getting up. Her dress danced in unnatural ways the fabric flapping and floating all around her glowing dots across her back in the shape of a fish.    “There are the Heavens the Hells and Harrenhal.” She responds reaching out her hand to touch her wardrobe being sure to stay in the light of the moon. Her hand reached out and she knocked her knuckles against the wood. The sound echoed and she smiled softly. “I stay here for my sisters. But I can go anywhere in the world” She spoke fondly as if death were a vacation.   “Is this what happens? To everyone who dies here?” he asked. He hadn’t seen any other ghosts at least as far as he was aware. She didn’t respond to his question only continuing to wander in her own little world.   “You are the boy who reads.” She says her big eyes looking at him. It was a bit hard to tell where she was focusing as she no longer had irises. She just looked.. Vacant in a way. The sight made shivers run up his spine.   “I am I read a lot. Does that interest you?” He asked. Never in his life did he think that he would be flirting with a ghost. She rolled her eyes he could tell in the twitch of her eyelashes.   “But you do not write” She spoke. Ah she had been listening in. Only then at the dinner table he hadn’t realized just how real she was.    “I don’t- well not publicly anyways. But I enjoy journaling” He couldn’t believe that he was saying all of this out loud.    “When I was alive I always wanted to write the best of stories. I had so much to say” She says softly and he can see her roaming the room to the bookshelves caressing all the spines. Her words hit his heart and he slowly rises to join her. “Death is very lonely. Most of my friends have left to the other side but there is still business for me here. It is a shame I cannot talk to my sisters” She says gently slowly picking up a book. It seems to fight her touch as she pulls the brittle pages open.    “But I am talking to you right now My Lady. How is it that I can hear you and they cannot?” He asked to which she shrugged.    “Quite the curious thing isn’t it? If only there were a handbook for the dead. I fear that everything I do is a wildcard. I never know what will come of it. It is only in this room that my touch can travel into the real world” She said and as though to prove it she reached out and pinched his cheek. He thought her touch would be cold and haunting. But it felt warm and it reached into his heart squeezing it tight. He had to fight the urge to lean into her.   “So what happens now?” He asked. He could not tell where this was going or why he was here in the first place.    “I suppose I can only beg you to keep me company. What have I missed in the world?” She asked and they spent hours staring at the ceiling as he told her of war overseas of family drama of insecurities that he kept well hidden.   “LIfe is too short to be insecure My Prince” She responded to which he scoffed. He almost answered with something petty but he quickly stopped himself. It was hard to remember that she wasn’t truly here especially when she felt so real. So real that everyone else seemed fake. It was a shame he could see himself falling in love with her. He had no desire to marry in Riverrun and in his luck he had fallen for the one woman he literally could not have. Not in any way.   “I suppose you’re right. But at least I do not intend to go swimming in the deep sea for shells” He teased holding his breath as he hoped for a laugh. Maybe joking about her death was in poor taste but to his relief she smiled.   “No but you do frequently find yourself in the skies on the back of a scaly beast” She said in return. He chuckled shaking his head as he reached to play with her hair.    “Vhagar is no beast she is a companion” He responded sighing as his touch reached to her nose and cheeks.   “I still cannot believe that I died in the sea” She mumbles softly. “How fragile life is. But at the end of the day we are just a bag of skin and bones. You drop it from high enough and it will burst” She mumbled to which he nodded. He hesitated before he spoke next licking his lips.   “I wish that we could have met when you were alive” He mumbled softly. She gently shook her head reaching to play with his eyepatch.    “We wouldn’t have liked eachother then. Death has made me wiser. I fear I would have only annoyed you when I was alive” She responded and he nodded quietly.   “I will probably think the same one day. When I am old and withered.” He responded and she slowly sat up.    “Yes I am sure you will regret this Grim Reaper attire you storm around in” She commented making him scoff.   “Many people enjoy my clothing actually” He teased and she shook her head.   “It still will not be your proudest moment… but you do look rather handsome” She spoke making blood burn in his cheeks. He hadn’t been called handsome not by a lady of the court or of course a ghost. Only his mother when he dressed up for his nameday or the whores who kept him company and showered him with compliments so long as he showered them with payment. He looked at her quietly feeling his face going soft. This was so humiliating and the only thing that would hear of it would be the parchment of his journal and the ink in his quill. “Were you this beautiful when you were alive?” He asked quietly. He was utterly captivated by her and his brows furrowed as he watched her slowly fade with the sun rise. Like a vampire disappearing into the shadows.    “I am uncertain. I don’t know what I look like anymore the mirrors do not cater to souls” She spoke looking over at the wall. There was a round silver backed mirror covered in seashells and little twirls of gold and twine and inside it he could only see his own face staring back at them.    “Are you disappearing?” He asked quietly reaching to touch her hand his fingers falling right into the blankets. She smiled at him and he could see the walls through her face.    “Why are you going to miss me?” She asked brows raised as she backed into the slimming shadows. He wanted to say no to roll his eye at the idea. But he knew he could be vulnerable with her. He found comfort in her condition knowing that she could not go talking to people about them about him and the way that he was getting so gentle for her.   “Of course my Lady” he responded.   “Very good. Now you need to get back to your rooms before my father finds you in here” She says moving through the wall. He wanted to respond but as he stared at the small bright spot in the wall it slowly faded like a flame without air. And now his lady was gone. With a sigh he quietly made his way back to the guest chambers laying on his back. He hardly got any sleep before the birds were chirping and he blinked away any sleepiness that remained. He had slept a total of two hours but he had never felt so well awake. (Y/N) he woken something up inside of him making him smile making his heart tremor.   He changed quickly into his day clothes before making his way down to the dining hall walking slow in the hallways in hopes of catching her whispers. The sounds of her footsteps a glimpse of her in the shadows. And when there was nothing he tried to hide his disappointment. “Ah My Prince I see that you are awake. Feel free to help yourself to fish and toast” Lord Tully spoke and he bit his tongue. These people really did enjoy having fish for every meal but he could hardly blame them. The water was where most of their wealth and resources came from down to the clay they used to sculpt their goods. His eye wandered around the table looking at all the faces of (Y/N)’s sisters. He could see the small resemblances.    The slightly wild brows the light glow of their skin. “I thought you may like to go with my daughter Elaena into the wetlands today. There are many exquisite creatures there be sure to bring your books and bottles” He nodded in response to the invitation getting a little awkward at the idea of spending a whole day with a lady. He ate his breakfast slowly his gaze darting to the vacant seat that haunted the table. Nothing. Not even her shadow. He sighed into his cup stacking his plates when he finished. He took his leather bag on his shoulder following Lady Elaena outside.   “You met my sister last night” She spoke matter-of-factly. He was immediately on edge looking down at her. She was rather short especially for a lady in the Riverlands. Her eyes were dark and she seemed a little out of it as if she was constantly in her own world.   “I did. I met all of you” He responded. He didn’t know why he felt so protective over his talks with (Y/N). They felt especially intimate.   “Yes. Even my dead one. What did you speak of?” She asked crouching down as their feet began to sink into the marsh. Her fingernails were stained brown and green from clay and plants. She was far from what the courts would consider feminine and yet she had something special about her. Maybe it was because she looked so much like (Y/N) but he felt a smile spreading on his face as he watched her.   “How do you know of our talk?” he asked quietly. Maybe (Y/N) could actually speak to her sisters maybe she was playing with him trying to make him feel like some sort of chosen one.    “I like to go to her room when I cannot feel her anymore. She leaves notes sometimes. When I opened her diary there was something new inside. Talk of a pretty Prince that made her dead heart sing.” She responded grabbing his hand to make him hold a container for her. She was looking through all types of rocks hitting some against others to make them crack in two. It was clear that she shared her sisters’ love for the wild. He blushed as she spoke and he took a deep breath as he tried to collect his thoughts.   “It is funny that if I had come only some moons ago I could speak to her in the flesh” He said a bit of sadness covering his face. What a life they could lie together. Spending every day like this bent at the river looking at the sea collecting things and wondering what they could be. They could have even gotten married. He tried not to let his mind go so far. He was just romanticizing her he hardly knew the girl the ghost and yet she already had him. Had him in her little dead palms.   “Perhaps. But you couldn’t have prevented her death none of us could. I am not meant to speak of it but everyone knows that she loved the arts. Even the ones that she was meant to stay away from. She gave her life for her discoveries it is only a shame that none of us will ever see them. I wonder how many secrets died with her in the sea” She mumbled solemnly. Arts that she was not meant to explore that could only mean one thing.   “She studied the dark magicks?” He asked brows raised. He would say that she did not seem like the type but between the shell-covered mirrors and her soft gaze he could not deny that there was something magical about her.   “I do not think that is the word for it. I do not believe any magick is dark. It is only the intensions that matter. She wished to change the world and she did. She changed all of us the moment that last breath escaped her lungs. There is a hole that must be filled we just do not know what to do with it. Her soul remains in our home and we have no way of freeing her. It is not a good feeling” She mumbled softly reaching into the water and pulling out a small fish studying its shining scales. “I do not think she was just hunting for any seashell. It was a spell of sorts. She had to perform a ritual beneath the moon where she had to trade something sacred of hers for a prize of her desires. I do not think she knew that she would be trading her life” She spoke gently standing back up. “This is an aclin pod. It creates a complex poison that can boil the skin when it penetrates the surface. But you can eat it safely isn’t that odd?” She asked her eyes bright and curious as if she had not just revealed the darkest of secrets.   “What was the prize?” He asked quietly. She simply looked at him let out a soft hum continuing to walk. “Elaena what was the prize?” He asked following behind her as they went through the forest.   “I do not know. I do not think she knows either. Maybe the whole thing was a great big trick” She mumbled and after that the Tully did not speak again. The story swam in circles around his mind until dinner until he was poking at a pile of potatoes ready to get up and rush to (Y/N)’s room to talk to her again. When the plates were finally cleared he made the statement that he was so tired from a long day of research saying a gentle good night as he quickly made his way up the stairs and finally as he was surrounded my the dark corridors he could hear her giggles.    “Did you miss me my little Prince?” Her voice whispered and he could feel the vibrations against his ears. He smiled quickly opening the door to her room. He was worried that maybe it wouldn’t be there at all covered in cob webs and missing all the charms. But to his relief she was there kneeling on the bed as she smiled up at him. “Well did you?” She asked brows raised. He sighed finally kneeling in front of the bed so they could be at eye-level.   “What do you think?” He asked softly reaching his hands to touch the fabric that rested on her skin. It felt like nothing like the feeling of seafoam’s caress on a sticky summer day. He played with the light blue material wondering if there was anything underneath it.    “I do not want to think I want to know” She teased and he licked his lips.   “Of course I missed you My Princess” He responded. He didn’t know what was coming over him a mix of desire. Desire to hold her to touch her to cling to her to bond with her. Just to be with her entirely.   “I am no Princess” She responded softly reaching to touch his hands. It felt so good to feel their skin together to feel her so alive in his hands.   “You are to me my beautiful Princess of death” He spoke reaching to touch her chin to pull her closer. She was a siren pulling away at all the barriers between them enchanting him intoxicating him. Maybe that was the truth. Maybe that’s what she was now a drowned maiden turned goddess. And he wanted to be her God. “Your sister told me the most fascinating story about you about magick and a ritual. Is it true?” He asked softly. He was so close that his eyelashes brushed her skin and if she had a heartbeat he’d be able to feel it against his skin. She nodded softly leaning forward until she could feel his breath on her face. It felt so warm. She had missed this.    “Of course it is” She responded. He nodded slowly not backing away from her. In fact he leaned closer kissing her cheek just to see if he could. He was pleasantly surprised to find his skin brushing against hers to feel the heat of her cheeks.   “And what was this great prize that you traded your life for?” He asked quietly. She didn’t say anything leaning toward him again aiming to kiss his mouth. The thought excited him but he leaned away. “No no… give me the answer first” He spoke holding her face. He liked the way her skin moved under his thumbs how he could squish her cheeks like dough.    “Love.” She responded making his head tilt. He thought she would want great powers or status or to transform into a mermaid or something. But love? He wasn’t sure he saw that coming. And someone so lovely and sweet as her so beautiful to have to perform magick for love? It confused him greatly but he slowly nodded.    “And did death give you this love…?” He asked slowly sewing the pieces together like a quilt in his mind. She smiled at him pulling him closer until their lips could meet in a brief small kiss. He felt his whole body burn under her and he closed his eye licking his lips for all the remnants of her touch.    “I like to think so” She mumbled into his mouth and soon they were kissing again and again slipping beneath the untouched blankets of the bed sending a cloud of dust into the air that made them both laugh.   “I didn’t think i’d ever fall for a dead girl” He spoke. It sounded so insane but then again it was probably not the oddest thing to happen to him.    “I did not think i’d ever find my prize” She responded her hand landing just over his heart feeling the foreign thump in her hand. “Aemond” She said quietly making his head pick up from the crook of her neck.    “Will you join me in death?” She asked. He paused lifting himself up as their eyes met.    “I-” He paused trying to figure out what it was that she was asking of him. Was she to wait the years until his body was frail and decaying? Or was she asking for something else? The answers came silently when her hand brushed over his dagger. He gazed down at her and slowly he complied with her request.  When the sun rose and the Second Son was stained red on the bed it did not take a genius to know what happened. He had gone peacefully with a smile still settled in his porcelain face like a little doll. (Y/N)’s room was tainted with death and the scent lingered in the air even when the blankets were gone. Elaena stared as they took his body into a carriage and she smiled to herself as soon as she could. In death her sweet sister finally got their prize. And for decades to come with every new guest in Harrenhal they could hear two laughs bouncing off the dark walls soft moans singing from the Lady’s old chambers and every now and then ink would paint the pages of her aged journal.  ‘Let us all find love in the next life  Sincerely  The Prince and Princess of Death.’     Thank You to everyone who reads! This was a little different from what I usually write but I hope its a good different!  -BK ♡,2024-07-07 22:26:07 GMT

15,House of the Dragon,['wtf is this plot'  'hotd'  "i really didn't want to write an essay here but i couldn't figure out how to make things more concise"  'alicent hightower'  'rhaenyra targaryen'  "also rhaenyra didn't even have a plan for some sort of compromise!!!!!"  'why are characters acting so dumb'],unsolicited-hotd-opinions,What is going on with Rhaenyra and Alicent? Why are they making these stupid decisions that don’t relate to the culture they live in or their character development from Season 1?  I really really liked most of House of the Dragon Season 1 and a lot of that had to do with the story of Alicent and Rhaenyra how their relationship deteriorated and what that situation had to say about women in this kind of world (some of which relates to our own world).  The two women’s rivalry wasn’t particularly interesting to me in the book (I also just didn’t find any of the royals likeable enough to care much what happened to them). Making them ex-teenage besties added so much delicious heartbreak to the story.  The way they were pitted against each other (and how they each made the situation worse) the different ways they viewed and dealt with the patriarchal nature of Westeros the role of a woman purity culture the fact that in any society so intensely focused on patrilineal descent and male primogeniture a women’s sexuality HAS TO BE CONTROLLED. All this made for a fascinating drama for me.  The FEAR of how they could hurt each other further that was evident in several episodes also seemed like such an important part of season 1. Otto told Alicent that she couldn’t trust Rhaenyra and that the princess would inevitably come for her children’s lives and that was a very reasonable concern but it wasn’t an absolutely unavoidable outcome. It seemed like a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy that afterwards they continued pushing each other away the bitterness and paranoia building until there was no turning back. This was also such an interesting way to look at the story and made both of them sympathetic.   …But then we find out that neither of them had any sort of plan to weather the coming shit-storm that was obviously coming after Viserys died…That seems strange since Alicent was shown to have been paranoid for so long about the fate of her family on Rhaenyra’s ascension. Alicent claimed Viserys barely coherent dying words was the only reason she wanted to put Aegon on the throne. I thought this was sort of an excuse at first (since 6 years ago she said that she wanted and expected Aegon to take the throne) but she was so wrapped up in the idea of being dutiful and well behaved person that she wanted to convince herself and others that she had a good reason to stage a coup not just fear and/or ambition.  But we then have the awkward talk in the Sept where upon hearing that she misunderstood Viserys’ last words Alicent seemed like she genuinely believed her own bullshit. That just seems so corny to me that it really was just a ‘misunderstanding’ when the writers had set up that she actually had every reason to want Aegon on the throne.  The whole Rhaenyra sneaking in to Kings Landing thing was totally stupid. Besides what I mentioned above it is very weird that either of them would be trying to make peace at this point when vengeance and retribution are such major aspects of their society. I like the characters being a bit more likable in the show and having some consciousness about how awful their war is going to be for the people. I like that there was a desire in the beginning for peace from these two characters. But it doesn’t make sense at this point. I want them to make realistic decisions and realistic mistakes for the society they live in.  And then Alicent just lets Rhaenyra leave!!!! That is an insane decision!!! If war is unavoidable the best thing to do is make it end quickly. And taking their rival Queen prisoner could lead to a much quicker win for the Greens.  I could go on about this but I really didn’t even mean to write this much and I have far too many thoughts bumping around in my head to form them all into complete sentences.  I just don’t understand what Ryan Condal is trying to do anymore!,2024-07-07 23:51:24 GMT

Some of them even shared the same last name as you did Bracken. But even though the evening was filled with music and light warmth and laughter from your family you still felt…disappointed.  You felt terrible of course sitting there in your fancy dress and feeling ungrateful at the ball that was thrown in your name—but you couldn’t help it.  People had come from all over the Riverlands for you uprooted their lives and paid good coin on gifts for you but none of that was what you truly wanted.   Your father had gone through great lengths to throw you this ball spending coin that he didn’t have just to celebrate and maybe find you a suitable match.  By all means it was supposed to be an amazing night in your life and yet you were so caught up in your feelings that you couldn’t even find it in yourself to be thankful.  All over you constantly spotted sigils from houses such as the Freys the Mootons and the Mallisters. Even the Tully’s had made an effort to appear but none of those sigils were the ones that you wanted to see.  None of those sigils belonged to him.   Admittedly you knew that you were a fool to ever think that he’d show up here. Your father would have sooner died than invite a Blackwood into his home let alone have one around his daughter.  It was a feeble thought and it was stupid of you to even be upset. Of course Benji would not show up your nameday celebration. You had known that ever since it was announced.  Your lover himself had told you that as much as he wanted to there was just no way for him to celebrate your nameday with you. He sure as hell wasn’t invited and it would be too risky and too bloody to just show up unannounced.   The chaos that would ensue if a band of Blackwoods showed up would ruin your nameday for certain. And as much as you wanted to see him you understood that his absence was for the best.   Still though the feeling of disappointment had its grip on you.  You tried to act normal and you tried to make it seem like you weren’t utterly gutted but you knew that your emotions had spilled out anyways. You were quiet and withdrawn choosing to stay at the high table in the seat of honor rather than get up and dance with every one else.  You had chosen to sip on your wine rather than prance around with a man you didn’t care about.   You knew it was petty but if your father wanted to be petty as well and not invite the Blackwoods then you vowed not dance with anyone other than Benji.   It was problematic seeing you were the guest of honor and you had declined many lords already but you held fast. Each and every man that came to your table was turned away to the displeasure of your father.  His ulterior motives of trying to find you a husband were not as discreet as he thought them to be. Every time the word ‘no’ left your lips to a potential match his lips pressed into a thinner and thinner line.  His patience with you was slowly running out.   Even though others might not have picked up on your sullen mood he did. You were your father’s daughter after all. It was easy enough for him to tell that something was wrong and whatever it was he wasn’t happy about it.  After making sure that the coast was clear and that was no one was listening he leaned in and addressed you with distain in his voice.  “Is something the matter with the celebration Y/N?” He asked tightly.   His eyes similar to yours bore into you from behind his mask. Curiosity along with annoyance could be seen pooling inside them.   The answer that you had been mentally rehearsing all night finally had its chance to slip out.   “No father. Nothing is wrong with the celebration. Everything you have done for me is beautiful and much appreciated.”  Your father clenched his jaw as you took a sip of your wine trying your best to avoid his heated stare.   “Is that so?” A small scoff left his lips. “Then why is it that you refuse to act the least bit of happy?”   You swallowed as your mind flickered to Benji. You were grateful that your mother had insisted on a masquerade ball and that your mask was big enough to cover your face. If it didn’t you feared you’d give much more than you wanted to away.  “I’m not…unhappy father” A sigh left your lips as you looked to the dance floor. Your eyes lingered on all of the couples who got to dance freely. On all of the ladies that got to be with who they wanted to without it ending in a bloody civil war.  Involuntarily envy pooled in your chest.   “I’m just..tired that’s all” You continued hoping your lie was enough.   It wasn’t.   Another scoff could be heard from your father as his chair scraped. From beside you on your left your mother looked on worriedly as he hissed.   “Tired? How can you be tired daughter when you have not even bothered to grace the dance floor?”  Silence was heard on your part as you swallowed again. You kept your eyes in front of you for fear that you’d say something to make him angrier. It wasn’t your intentions to get into it with your family not tonight so you kept your eyes straight and your mouth shut.  You focused on the many people on the dance floor as your father simply shook his head mumbling about how ungrateful his daughter was.   Your mother simply gave you a disappointed look but you ignored them both as something caught your attention.  At first you thought that you imagined it. A simple trick of the light perhaps or maybe you just had too much wine but you could have sworn that you saw a flash of black accompanied by broad shoulders and wide gleaming eyes.  Your gaze became locked onto the stranger that bared these traits so familiar to you but so far away. With your heart hammering in your chest you watched as he made his way onto the dance floor. You couldn’t see him yet not properly anyways. He was still hidden behind the horde of people all crowded together. Hiding behind the multitude of dancers and weaving in and out of the crowd.   It took all you had to keep your gaze on him and not look away. You couldn’t lose him. Not until he got closer. Not until you were sure.   For now you were stuck following his movements with care watching as he came closer and closer until finally…  Your heart stopped.  You weren’t sure if it was the wine or if you truly were hallucinating as your eyes locked with his Benji coming to stand right in front of the high table. Beside him were two other men all bare of any sigils and hidden under masks. But they were there. They were…  No no.   It couldn’t be. He wouldn’t dare.  …Would he?  You started to doubt yourself. Telling yourself that there was no way that it could be him. It was too much of a risk. It was too dangerous for him to even consider such a thing…  But then he began to smile. That damned smile that you would recognize anywhere under a mask or not. That and his eyes. You knew those eyes. That wide-eyed crazed stare that often sent your heartbeat racing through your chest.  You knew them like the back of your hand. And sure enough as you stared into the crowd looking directly into those eyes he winked.  Your chair scraped immediately.   Without much warning you stood shooting a quick mumble towards your father before racing down the steps and towards him with determination.  Your father thankfully was none the wiser as you rushed forward nodding in approval as you reached Benji and looped your arm with his.  He thought you had simply come to your senses and was dancing with some lord.   He had no idea who you were moving towards the dance floor with and if he did you were sure that the smile would be wiped right off his face.  Lord Bracken would start a war if he knew a Blackwood had snuck under his roof but alas that was the last thing that you were worried about.  You were more concerned about your lover getting caught the fool having the nerve to laugh as you dragged him through the crowd. The two men he had brought along with him tried to follow but they quickly ended up getting lost.  It was almost impossible to navigate through all of the twirling bodies but you made it your mission to weave through them Benji’s laughter getting lost under all of the noise. You were grateful that the masks at least concealed your true identities allowing you to pull him along until no one else was around.  You managed to make it all the way to your room without getting stopped. As you did you opened the door and all but threw Benji inside making sure the door was locked before turning to your lover with a glare.   A wild gleam appeared in his eyes as he stared at you. It was obvious that he was more pleased than afraid as he grinned crackling as he embraced you in his arms.  “Benji Benji! Put me down!”   His laughter mixed in with your shouts of protests as Benji suddenly picked you up spinning around in his arms.  The world suddenly went blurry for a moment as your lover twirled you your eyes going in and out of focus. You felt dizzy whenever he finally let go of you swaying a little bit until Benji steadied you.   When he did you swore with everything inside of you were going to kill him.   “You idiot! What the hell were you thinking?”  Benji smiled sheepishly as you turned your fiery gaze on him a mix of concern and anger lacing your voice. Worriedly you glanced to the door afraid that someone would burst through and discover him even though you had locked it.   With little time to protest you were swept into his arms again and pulled against him.  “I was thinking that couldn’t help myself my love. It is your nameday and I had to see you” He said softly pressing his forehead to yours.  Instantly some of your anger began to dissolve. You blamed not seeing him for weeks as the reason you began to fold so quickly but some of your worry and panic still bled over.  “You had to? Benji you could have been caught! Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to be here right now? If my father or the guards had discovered you—”  Benji cut you off with a loud laugh.  “Your guards are the sorriest cunts I have ever seen in my life” He snorted. “I could have snuck an entire army into Stone Hedge and no one would have batted an eye.”  “Hey!”  You playfully swatted his shoulder giggling softly because you knew he was right. If your guards had done their jobs then Benji wouldn’t be here right now. Alone in a room with their Lord’s daughter staring at her with a hungry look in his eyes.   A million different things ran through your mind. Everything from terror at getting caught to just being plain excited that he was here flooded your veins. You kept looking over your shoulder expecting your door to burst open any second while Benji continued to hold you.  It took a few seconds but when you were sure that no one was coming to seize your lover and take him away a smile broke out on your face and you quickly embraced him back.  You threw your arms around Benji and held him tight burying your head into the crook of his neck as you laughed lightly.   “Leave it to you Benjicot Blackwood to risk death and torture just to wish me a happy nameday” You whispered feeling his chest rumble underneath you.   Benji shrugged. “And to give you this” He said cheekily pulling away. When he did you saw him reach into his pocket for a second before slowly pulling something out.  You bit your lip as Benji handed you a box a velvet box with the Blackwood sigil embroidered on top.  With a curious look you opened it up and then gasped at what you saw inside.  “This is…this is for me?” You asked incredulously.   Benji nodded grinning.  “Of course it is love. You’re the only Bracken I can give that to without loosing my head” He teased slightly before continuing.   “D’you like it though? I had to go four towns over all the way to The Crag so people wouldn’t ask questions. Figured it would have been strange if a Blackwood was caught asking someone to make a neckless with a Bracken sigil.”   The shyness that he sometimes was known for was evident on his face as he waited for your response Benji nervously playing with his hands.  Luckily though he didn’t have to wait long. He sighed in relief as he saw you grin pulling him into another bone crushing hug and kissing his cheek.   “Benji…of course I love it” You whispered in his ear making him shiver. You could feel him relax underneath you hugging you back as your eyes threatened to fill with tears.   “You mean it?” He asked a bit more vulnerability shining through.   Your heart filled with more love that you thought was capable.   “Of course I mean it. How could I not?” You asked him softly. “It’s beautiful and I can’t imagine it was easy for you to even have this made.”  You made a jest in order to keep yourself from crying.   Benji laughed lightly. “Aye. It nearly killed me to spend coin on that ugly red stag but I think the back of it makes up for it. Look.”  He gestured for you to flip the necklace over and when you did you discovered that it was double-sided. On the front the sigil of house Bracken was carved unassuming to anyone who saw it. But on the back…  You ran your fingers over the weirwood tree surrounded by ravens and lightly gasped. It was the sigil of House Blackwood the symbol that belonged to the man you loved.  In tiny letters barely visible unless you squinted the initials B.B were engraved in one of the ravens.  Benjicot Blackwood.   “Oh. It’s beautiful Benji. Thank you” You said again your voice thick with emotion as you saw it. This time you weren’t able to keep the tears from your eyes one of them falling down your cheek as you sniffled.   Gently Benji reached to your face and wiped it away. He smiled lightly and gestured for you to turn around. Taking the necklace from your hands he then unclasped it and gently placed it around your neck.   When he did he flipped it so that the symbol of House Blackwood showed instead.  “There. Just as it belongs” He said.   Sniffling lightly you allowed him to run his fingers over it Benji placing soft kisses on your neck before turning you around.   When you did you immediately planted your lips upon his unable to resist it any longer.  You could tell that Benji was taken by surprise by the sudden action but he quickly wasted no time in kissing you back. He matched the amount of passion in your kiss greedily drinking in the taste of you after being starved for so long.  Not long after what started as a soft slow kiss turned into something more. The desperation that you both felt after not seeing each other for a while pooled over and soon enough you found yourself tugging on his hair wanting something more.  Benji clearly felt the same as he began to lead you towards the bed.   Gently he laid you down on the soft covers and your heart pounded as he leaned over you.  Once more his lips met yours in a swift kiss but this time it was accompanied by roaming hands.  You felt him touching you everywhere that he could Benji feeling all of the parts that he missed.   His hands lingered on your waist and then your chest fingers dancing over the material that covered your breasts. It was clear that just feeling you over your clothing wasn’t enough. He wanted more and so you weren’t surprised when he broke the kiss eyes hungry as he tugged on the yellow garb.   “Take this off” He demanded softly his dark eyes wild with lust.  Quickly you sat up and with his assistance was able to get it off. Benji struggled a little bit when it came to your corset resulting in your lover getting impatient.   Regrettably this meant that you would have to explain to your Septa why the strings looked like they had been cut with a knife. A little annoyance pooled inside of you at the inconvenience but you tried not to think about that as you stared at him anxious to know what he wanted next.   “Turn around” Benji then rasped taking no time to drink in your naked body. “I want you on your knees ass in the air.”  Despite his filthy words his tone was oddly soft. Desire pooled in your core as you obediently listened eager for whatever it was he had planned for you. You laid your head on your soft pillow eyes fluttering shut as you felt the bed dip behind you.   You sighed as Benji kneeled in between your legs. In an instant your felt his calloused hands roaming over your body trailing all the way from the small of your back to the center of your core. Gently his padded fingers traced your slick folds eliciting a moan from you when they brushed over your clit.   “Fuck how I’ve missed this.”  You said nothing as his fingers continued to tease your clit too busy panting at the sensation.   It had been too long you noted since you had felt your lovers’ touch.   The more that tensions between your houses grew the less time that you had to spend with Benji. It was too risky to be seen anywhere near Blackwood territory and your father had doubled the guards making it nearly impossible to sneak out. Your meetings had been so few as of late leaving you craving his touch like no other.   Eagerly you wanted to take advantage of this opportunity moaning when Benji sank a digit into your tight cunt. You cursed softly as he began to pump in and out loving the way he curled them inside of you to reach your pleasure spots.  It seemed that your time apart did nothing to impact Benji’s memory. He still remembered exactly how to make you come undone adding more and more digits until your cunt was stuffed.   The more fingers that he added the louder you moaned. Pleasure that you had not experienced in weeks quickly began to cloud your senses making you forget that you were supposed to be quiet in case anyone overheard you.   You could only imagine the disaster that would ensue if Benjicot Blackwood was discovered knuckle-deep inside of Lord Bracken’s daughter. Making her come undone on his fingers slowly but surely and whispering the filthiest of words in her ear.  You imagined that the aftermath wouldn’t be pretty but alas all of those thoughts and worries faded away the minute you felt Benji kneel down attaching his mouth to your cunt.  Any previous thoughts that you had were gone—replaced by muffled moans and incoherent blabber.   You whimpered as you felt Benji’s tongue lapping at your folds eating your cunt like he was a man starved.   You felt him sucking on your clit taking the bud into his mouth just as his index and middle finger curled against the right spot.   The combined pleasure had you gasping out pillow forgotten as strangled cries left your lips.  Benji could feel your cunt tightening around his fingers and he smirked coaxing you through your orgasm as you moaned and withered under him.  It took all he had to hold you down using his free hand to keep your cunt firmly pressed against him. He refused to let up his assault until he could taste you on his tongue the sweetness of your juices making him groan as well.   When he finally pulled away and released you from his hold you managed to weakly look behind you and see him grinning. Benji licked his fingers his face shiny with your arousal as he met your eyes.   “Hmm. So fuckin’ sweet. You want to taste raven?”  Meekly you nodded your face and your core burning at the nickname. Benji smiled as he leaned down to kiss you letting you taste yourself on his lips while he grinded into you.  You could feel his cock hard as stone poking against your thighs. The thought of him being inside of you after so long briefly made you loose the ability to breathe as excitement flooded your veins.  The action allowed for Benji to slip his tongue in your mouth kissing you sloppily for a moment before reluctantly pulling away.  His wild eyes were dark with lust as he fiddled with his own clothing loosening his trousers so that his cock could spring free.  You felt your mouth water as you watched him stroke himself for a moment spurts of preseed dripping down the base.   Benji let a hand roam over your back and gently used it to push you down spreading your legs so that he could settle in between them.   With your back arched and your face pressed firmly against the pillow once again he teased you by dragging his cock along your folds and then he pushed in.  Together you both let out a whine as Benji’s cock sank inside of you your lover letting out a swear as you gripped him tight.   It had been a while since the two of you had sex and it was evident in the way your legs trembled your cunt straining to take him as he sank deeper.   You let out another whine reaching behind you for something to grip. Luckily Benji seemed to get the message clear enough and quickly he intertwined your fingers together.  Once he was buried inside of you to the hilt he stilled for a moment trying to catch his breath. Light kisses were peppered against your back as he leaned over you holding you as close as possible before his hips began to move.  In a slow rhythm he dragged his cock in and out as if to savor the moment.   As his hips snapped against yours and sent jolts of ecstasy through your body your moans slowly started to combine.  You had forgotten how much you missed this. You had forgotten how much you missed him. Loneliness was awful but often times it was easy to get accustomed to it. After all it’s what you signed up for when you took a Blackwood for your lover.   You expected to go days weeks or even months without seeing Benji. So when he was here you did all you could to savor him before he had to leave again.  Every breath every groan and every whisper of encouragement was committed to memory. Every touch every kiss cherished.   You relished in the way Benji’s cock felt against your walls squeezing him as if it would somehow help you remember how it felt.   A small curse left his lips as you did Benji leaning down to suck a love bite on your skin.  As his teeth grazed your neck you groaned as he somehow managed to find both of your sweet spots.   “That’s it. That’s it. Good girl. Good fuckin’ girl.”  Benji praised you as you began to fuck yourself on his cock throwing your hips back and meeting his trusts. Your moans combined together as the pace sped up the sound of heavy breathing quickly filling the room.   After a moment you felt his weight shift off of your body as Benji opted to get back on his knees. He used his hands to keep your hips steady pushing down on the small of your back to keep it arched.  With this new angle he was able to drive into you quicker and repeatedly hit your sweet spot. Curses left his lips as you began to tremble around him his own orgasm approaching at the same time as yours.  “Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck!”  You gripped the sheets tightly as obscenities left his mouth feeling Benji quickly pull out of you just as your peak washed over you.   Hot spurts of his seed coated your back Benji spilling himself onto your skin before finishing you off with his fingers.  The absence of his cock was most disappointing but by the time you came down from your high you barely noticed.  You were too busy in a state of bliss turning around to capture Benji in a kiss before shakily pulling away.   “Are you alright my love?” He asked immediately panting heavily as he collapsed next to you.   Sometimes it amazed you how quickly he could change. One moment Benji was shy and sweet giving you the most beautiful necklace for your nameday. And then the next he was making you cum whispering the dirtiest things in your ear and fucking you so good that you saw stars.   Now he had switched again his soft side back on display as he held you in his arms.   He was careful enough not to cum inside of you and—much to your displeasure—had used your fancy yellow dress to wipe up his seed.  You suspected that he was too pleased by the action but you opted not to say anything about it. Instead you merely disregarded the dress and chose to cuddle in his arms trying to soak the last remaining moments you had.  “Of course I’m alright. It is my nameday and I’ve just received the best gift of the night” You replied after some pause.  You knew him well enough that you could practically hear the smirk appear on his face.   “What? The sex?” Benji asked cheekily to which you playfully elbowed him.  “No you fool!” You giggled as you knew that was exactly what he was going to say. “The necklace! The necklace you risked life and limb to deliver to me personally!”   You rolled your eyes as Benji began to laugh behind you the cheerful sound echoing through your chambers.  “Right right. That is what I risked life and limb for” He said innocently.   You didn’t have the energy to do anything expect roll your eyes again. You swore he was so stupid sometimes. From sneaking into enemy territory to making silly little jests your Benji sure was a character to be reckoned with.   But that was exactly what you loved about him.   Sighing softly you shook your head and listened to the sound of his breathing. It remained steady behind you as Benji slowly relaxed settling in your bed like he was simply at home.   If you didn’t know any better you’d say that he was falling sleep. His body was certainly still enough to think so but you knew as well as he did that he couldn’t stay here.  The party downstairs was slowly dying down. If you listened close enough you could hear the final songs planned for the night dwindling down and you knew pretty soon someone was going to come for you.   Benji couldn’t be here when they did.  Your father was probably already angry enough at your lack of presence. If he ever discovered the reason why you had so suddenly disappeared then he would have your head—Benji’s too.  And as much you loved lying in his arms feeling the warmth and the love radiating from his body you loved seeing Benji alive much more.   So sure enough as the final notes on the final songs began to play he stood up.   “Well I suppose that’s my cue to take leave then.”  Benji smiled sadly as he began to gather his clothes redressing while you watched him with despair. The sheets that were wrapped loosely around you began to fall as you stood as well walking over to him just as he readjusted his dagger.   “Do you promise to come visit me soon?” You asked him anxiously.  Slowly Benji began to nod. He knew as well as you did that soon was debatable. Tensions were at all time high as whispers of war breaking out in the Kingdom spread. They added to the already strained relations between your houses.  Still though Benji could not bare to see your disappointment. He didn’t want to leave on a bad note either so he settled for an unserious answer to ease the situation.  “If your father doesn’t replace his guards any time soon then I’ll be able to visit you any time you’d like” He chuckled.  He was met by a small giggle that had his heart smiling with joy. Softly you gripped his hand savoring his touch as you knew that it would be the last time for a while.  “Stay safe out there Blackwood” You told him softly. “Don’t get into any trouble and for Seven’s sake leave the assize stones alone. Make sure that you come back to me you hear?”  Your tone was playful but he knew that you were being as serious as a dead man.  Briefly his lips twitched a little as he fought the urge to tell you that it was your family that messes with the stones. But ultimately he agreed.   “I will. I promise” Benji said sincerely.   A soft kiss was then planted on your lips you and Benji holding onto each other for one last time. When you pulled away a sigh of disappointment left your lips as you watched him walk away.   Closing your eyes you decided to count his footsteps until he reached the door.   When you got to ten you heard the door open. And one last time Benji called out to you.  “Oh. And Bracken?”  “Hmm?”  You opened your eyes to see that familiar goofy smile his eyes shining as he looked at you.  “I almost forgot to tell you but happy nameday my love. I do hope that this was a good one” Benji laughed.  And with that he closed the door leaving you smiling and shaking your head behind him.  That fool. What one earth am I going to do with you Benjicot Blackwood?,2024-07-07 23:42:49 GMT

223,House of the Dragon,['benjicot blackwood'  'hotd'  'benjicot blackwood x oc'  'davos blackwood'  'kieran burton'],aprilcolours,blackheart - part three part one - part two - part four  *warning: some nsfw*  —  Visenya did not sleep well that night dreams haunted by the memory of warm hands a sly grin and eyes that gleamed in the dark.   She awoke to the arrival of a raven from her mother the Queen. The message it carried was simple but a revelation. She dressed quickly braiding her hair haphazardly before rushing out of her tent. She was greeted by the anxious face of Oscar Tully waiting straight-backed by the entrance.   “Your highness…” the knight began clearly apprehensive “there is an urgent matter…the Lord Blackwood… that is well he…”  “Speak plainly Ser” she bit out a stone sinking into the pit of her stomach. The knight straightened his impeccable posture even further and responded  “Benjicot has taken upon himself to retrieve the head of Lord Lannister. He absconded in the night alone taking only a horse and his blades. I can assure you had I been present at the scene I would have stopped this folly—”   The Tully continued on explaining that he had already punished those who had not alerted him and apologizing profusely but Visenya ceased listening. Her heart thrummed in her chest and the sound of blood rushed in her ears.   Though they had pushed the Lannister army back at Lydden Lord Jason Lannister had escaped alive and retreated westward. She had not chased him because she had not thought it worth the risk to her men. ‘Let him run’ she had said.   Clearly that bloody fool disagrees she thought. Godsdamnit all.   “Hold the fort Ser Tully” she decreed tone leaving no room for argument. The knight nodded solemnly and bowed but she had already walked away. She made haste out of camp grabbing a hood as she went. She had Vermithor in the air and chasing westward in a matter of minutes. The Blackwood had a night’s head start but the Bronze Fury was not a horse.   It took into the afternoon at ceaseless top speeds but they caught up to the vanguard of the retreating army. Vermithor rose high above the clouds so that they might avoid being spotted taking care to approach downwind. They circled back to land behind the cover of hills and Visenya threw her cloak over her head.   This boy will be the death of me she swore as she crept stealthily into the enemy camp.   Their defenses were lowered it was clear they did not expect an attack as they had not been chased. Many tended to the wounded and dead and many others drank wine to wile away the midday hour. Despite herself she wrinkled her nose at the indiscipline.   Keeping to the shadows and when needed playing at being some nursemaid or other servant Visenya moved through the lines unnoticed watching carefully for any sign of the raven-dark haired boy. At the center of camp she reached a tent featuring an ostentatious display of wealth that could only belong to the Lord of the Westerlands. She circled round the back and tucked under the edge of the fabric wall her blades at the ready.   Benjicot Blackwood stood above the still bleeding corpse of Lord Jason Lannister. Blood had splattered across his grim vicious face. He whirled on her a dagger swiftly raised to her throat.  “What in all the God’s names do you think you are doing” she hissed raising a finger to the tip of his dagger and pushing it down.   His rabid grin curled higher at the sight of her stepping swiftly into her space. He did not even seem surprised to see her simply delighted.   “I have won you a great prize my lady” he whispered voice low and husky. “A lion’s head.”   “I can assure you that getting yourself killed would be no prize to me” she muttered back grabbing his arm and pulling back the way she came. He resisted gesturing to the body with his dagger.   Seeing in his sparkling eyes that he meant no jest she asked “What madness has possessed you?!”  “I would return a hero and earn myself honors befitting your hand” he replied as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. Still he steadfastly resisted her pulls.   Visenya Targaryen II did not beg. But here for only his ears to hear she breathed a small simple:  “Please.”  Finally the dark fire in his eyes banked and he relented allowing himself to be pulled out of the tent and the rest of the way out of the camp. She did not loose her grip once hands firmly tangled together as they passed between shadows.   He trudged forward a sullen silence about him as though he had failed.   Silly creature she thought fondly as they crested the hill that hid Vermithor. She tugged him forward towards her waiting dragon. Only then did he stop again tugging out of her grip brows raised.   “You would allow me to ride beside you princess?”   “I would.”  “It would give a certain impression to the other lords” he remarked voice bitter and sharp. She simply smiled a small smile.  “I am aware” she replied “They could hardly object to my riding alongside my betrothed.”  At the shock writ across his bloody face she could not help but laugh. With a grin she continued “The raven from my mother arrived this morning. I would have told you immediately had you not run off.”  He took a step to close the distance between them but Visenya lept back— expression playful.   “Although there is one left whose approval you should seek” she teased taking another step back. She reached out her hand for him to take.  Bloody Benjicot Blackwood was many things but never a coward. With a breath and the beginnings of a sly grin he took the offered hand. Together they approached the great beast at the bottom of the hill.   “Rhaenagon ñuha valzȳrys” she said as the bronze dragon watched their approach. Vermithor raised his great big head with a shake and sniffed at the pair.   “Bloody fucking hells” Ben swore underneath his breath. Visenya laughed again and raised their joined hands to touch the dragon’s snout.   After a moment she gently pulled the boy towards the ropes and ladders that led up onto Vermithors back. He took a moment to look at her and read the challenge in her eyes. Then with another muttered curse Benjicot began to climb.   Visenya followed after a smug expression playing at her lips and crouched in front of him when they reached the seat.   She fastened the belts that anchored to the saddle around his waist and tried desperately not to blush as her fingers brushed his thighs.   “Shouldn’t these be for you my lady?” he asked eyelids low as he watched her hands and their careful movements.   “Please” she scoffed “I haven’t used the harness since I was two and ten.” She was aiming for nonchalant but she could tell she missed the mark slightly by the way his eyes narrowed and his grin sharpened. He leaned closer and spoke in a low tone  “Is there some cause for nervousness your highness?”   They were close enough now that they shared breaths mingling together in the damp air. Visenya bit her lip. Benjicot’s eyes immediately tracked the movement shifting closer still. She was sure he would kiss her.   “Sōvegon!” she called suddenly and Vermithor began to prepare to take off. Ben’s eyes shot wide open and he grasped at her arms. Visenya laughed throwing her head back her long braid tossed about.   “Do not worry Lord Blackwood” she grinned shifting around to sit properly. His arms immediately closed around her waist in a vice grip his warm chest pressed tightly at her back. “Your princess would not allow harm to befall you.”   She felt his shaky laugh against the shell of her ear and she shivered.   Vermithor took two great bounding steps before launching skyward. Benjicot held her waist so tightly she could barely breathe. Visenya laid one hand atop his to comfort and he immediately locked her fingers between his own.   They climbed and climbed into the sky rising above the low lying misty clouds until they broke through the cloud base and the sun shone upon them. Vermithor leveled out pace steady and even now.   “Ñāqa” she commanded. Visenya turned intending to speak but the words died on her lips as she looked at the boy with her.   His face was aglow with an awe-struck smile looking down upon his home from the sky.   He is rather handsome isn’t he she noticed as the sun shone on his raven dark hair illuminating the shape of his features— perhaps plain on their own but thrilling in their vicious combination. So distinctly him.   She studied him as he took in the miracle of flight. She had the impulse to kiss his cheek. So she did. I am done denying when it comes to him she decided.   His gaze shot to hers brows furrowed like she was an impossibility. He raised one hand to cup her jaw and neck in his broad hand.   This time when he kissed her it was torturously painstakingly slow. A thorough languid exploration of all the ways tongues could dance. She gasped at the slow banking fire that smoldered low in her belly.   They kissed and kissed and kissed even as her neck ached from the angle.   When she finally placed a hand on his chest and pushed him lightly so that she might breathe her lips were well swollen and eyes glazed. Their chests heaved as if it had been a tremendous exertion.   Visenya became slowly aware of something hot and hard poking into her backside.   No she thought It can’t be… But as she peered back into his face and he swiftly avoided eye contact she was sure.   She nearly forgot all sense.   Seven hells. She cleared her throat turning forward. The motion nestled that part of him even closer. His hands were balled into fists at her waist.   “Adere Vermithor!” she called.   The rest of the flight was spent in a loaded silence though it fortunately wasn’t too much further. A few hundred yards before they reached the sprawl of camp they landed.   Once firmly on the ground there was a beat as neither quite knew what to say.   “Should we take a moment?” Visenya asked finally. As if speaking it aloud had made the situation clear they both burst into raucous cackling fits of laughter.   Benjicot buried his head into her hair to stifle his embarrassment with a groan. She pressed the back of her hand to her mouth as the giggles continued.   They sat there pressed tightly together for a time. Their breaths heaving in tandem.   “I would wed you now” the Blackwood finally decreed breaking the silence “Tonight.”     —     A/N: ta daaaa!! so there will be one more part for sure after this maybe more we’ll see  Rhaenagon ñuha valzȳrys - Meet my husband  Sōvegon - Fly   Ñāqa- East  Adere- Faster,2024-07-07 23:34:10 GMT

Reluctantly your mother arranges a host to home you in heed of the war to come. One of her strongest Riverland supporters house Blackwood of Raventree Hall.   A Dragon Flees | A Raven Observes | A Shared Comfort | Harsh Words Quick Regrets | Soft Prayers | TBA     You are falling through the sky quickly from the clouds. Surrounded by a great storm of rain and lighting. Thunder rushing through your body and mind. Not knowing when or if you’ll land. You grasp at the air as if there is something to hold onto. Plunged into darkness cold rushing water fills your lungs and envelops your body. You’re unable to breathe a scream erupting from you that’s not quite yours clawing fiercely for the surface. It gets darker and darker.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; You awake with a start sweat covering your body and choking on water that isn’t there. Five long nights it had been like this little to no sleep. Though of what you could get was filled with terror and violence only your mind could conjure. Large teeth water fear. Each night you wonder if that is the only thing your little brother experienced in his last moments.  You already knew it was no good to attempt to sleep once more. Dressing yourself and readying for the day as best you could without your maid. Huffing at the idea of tying your bodice entirely you decide you are decent enough. For it is still night who would truly be looking upon you? Though you are still forgoing shoes the loud clunk had made you cringe as you pulled them out and sat them on the floor.   Taking a lowly lit candlestick to light your way within the dark halls of Dragonstone you exit your chambers from the servant’s entrance. As to not alert your night watch guard. Padding slowly through the halls allowing the light to flicker and bounce back and forth from ceiling to wall and to wall. The flame casts a shadow you could have sworn was in the familiar shape of a boy. Stopping in your tracks taking in a breath and holding it. Though as fast as it flickered into view it’s replaced with the ever-dancing light. You almost refuse to exhale as you calm your aching heart. You make way for the family room for surely it would be empty but with enough light to read. Upon your arrival the door is already ajar and curious to see who it is you peek between the cracks.   Your mother.  A relieved sigh filled with the breath you were still holding leaves you. The creaks make your presence known pushing the heavy door open further. She is standing at a table entranced with a book of which you assume ascertains the strategy of war. It was inevitable at this point everyone knew it but did not know when.  Looking up at you with tired eyes red as yours are. You approach her silently no words need to be spoken between you. Sitting the candlestick gently down on the table you come to stand beside her as she turns the page. With only a glance you see you were right in your assumption. Battle formations dangers of this and that and where to hold quickly. You look up towards her but she does not move her downcast eyes from the page.   “If it is to start” she begins quietly. “It will not be by my hand.” she finally looks at you and you take in the true sight of her state. You had lost a brother and she a son. You could not imagine if the pain was enveloping you in such ways of what your mother felt deep inside.  Taking comfort in resting a hand on her arm you shuffle ever closer to her. “Have you slept?” your voice barely above a whisper. She places her own palm upon your hand a knowing look upon her. “Have you?” you cannot bear to look her in the eyes. Neither of you had. Tired to the bone with no comfort to take in easing it. This is one of the few moments you’ve truly been allowed alone with your mother to grieve to comfort.   Softly she closes the book setting it aside on the large table and gently blowing out the candles allowing her to read in the dark room. The only light remaining is your ever-growing smaller flame and that of the hearth. Turning her full attention upon you snaking her soft hands into yours and holding them close to her. You breathe in deep an almost panicked tone leaving you.   “Mother I-” You start and abruptly stop as your voice breaks heavily and your throat fills with tears. Gathering confidence once more you start again. “Mother I wish to leave this place.” You keep your eyes downcast. The moment you say leave your hands are quickly left empty her holding her hands close to herself as if to keep her safe. Finally you look up her jaw is tightened and the look she gives you sends a fright only a mother could give their child.     “No.” Low quick and dismissive that is her answer. No.    You reach for her hands once more “Please” You almost beg. She steps back from you turning away towards the dying fire. You are dejected as she takes quick steps towards the hearth and nearly drops herself into the chair in front of it.     “No I will not have it.” She says briskly as she turns her upper body away hand cupping her own face.   Almost in a rush towards her you drop your knees to the light rug covering the floor. At her lap you place your arms no you fling your arms towards her. Tears falling freely down your cheeks now. “Please muñnykeā” mother.    Resting your forehead upon her lap you cannot stop yourself the common tongue escaping you in your moment of need.   “Iksan qrimbrōstan lēda ēdrurys va moriot hen hen ñuha māzigon.”    I’m cursed with memories always out of my reach. Tears are beginning to soak your mother’s dress and she does not move and neither do you.  Not holding back sobs nor snot you continue unable to stop yourself. “Bē mirre ñuha ābrar eman gīmigon bisa dōros se sir iksan ojūdan istin tolī iemnȳ zȳha geralbar”    Almost all my life I have known these halls and now I am lost once more within its passageways.    “ Jikagon nyke mirri skoriot tolmiot qrīdrughagon. Naejot Jelmor se Ēyrī iā se Qelbria. Daor bisa zōbrie dīnagon”    Send me away anywhere. To the North the Eryie or the Riverlands. Not this dark place.  Sobs are wracking your body and your words are slurred. Pressing yourself further into your mother as a small child would. She grasps your hands her hold becoming tighter as you continue.    “ Zȳhon elēni wakes nyke se nyke daor zirȳla naejot se daor ūndegīon”    His voice wakes me and I cannot follow him to the beyond. At the mention of him she too breaks cradling you as she would when you were young. Her hold is strong warm and protective. You lift your head to meet her gaze with tear-stained cheeks and labored breathing. Your bottom lip trembles as you look into her eyes. For a moment you wonder if she sees a mirror in your own as you do hers. An echoing of grief back and forth not the same but so alike in your hearts.  She swallows hard and breaks her gaze once more. A deep intake of breath and she speaks first this time. “You may go.” There is an almost crack to it so low and soft. This was not an ask you had taken lightly and you’re almost ashamed now having asked in such a way so soon. She doesn’t look back down but you have already caught the clear tears running down her cheeks. Running so quickly they fall and meet at her throat and down her breast. Almost a river of a broken heart flowing.  “The Blackwoods are most loyal to my claim amongst those in the Riverlands. They would not resist the honor of hosting a princess.” Her voice has smoothed but the tears do not stop. She still holds onto your arms with a grip you think is stronger than she realizes.   “We will send a raven in haste.”  You nod as she turns back to you lifting your arms along with your body to stand with hers. A look in her eyes you cannot quite place it’s almost far away almost knowing but you cannot comprehend what about.    So young a child. My child Rhaenrya thinks. A child wishing to have her freedom from the confines of grief for the first time. A want no a need. An emotion she had also felt so deeply when she was young. Losing her own mother and brother. This time however she could be the one to grant that freedom.    “You will only go as” Rhaenrya continues “as” She chokes on her own words lost in thought eyes connecting with your own. Only as a messenger only as Lucerys had been. You know what she was thinking. She breathes in continuing to squeeze your arms for your comfort or hers you did not know. She swallows nods and continues.    “Do not partake in rash actions the war has not started. Not by my hand nor yours.”  Your lips in a thin line and a swift nod. “Yes my Queen.”  Your mother shakes her head and smiles standing alone with you still.  “ñuha tala” She says softly cupping your cheeks in an embrace pulling you close to her heart where you belong. Where you will always belong. You respond in kind breathing softly against her “muña”    My daughter.   Momma     ~     The coming days are slow and quiet. You sit with Jacaerys on the beach. Watching your dragons fly high above. Though not many words are said between you. What would there be to say? I’m sorry but I have to run away like a child and not the dragon I should be.  Though you know he understands that much you knew. He has more power here than you would. He speaks with your mother in a way you cannot an understanding you do not have. Sending you to the Riverlands with your dragon would be seen as protection for the lords whether or not you were a man.   A dragon is a dragon.  You had already begun your packing of belongings. Your clothes and valuables would be packed away and sent with an envoy to Raventree Hall. Though it would take significantly more time to arrive there than you will. A day’s ride on dragon back maybe a day and a half since you were in no hurry. Your belongings a day or two later behind you. You hope a dragon’s saddlebag would suffice in dressing you properly until your things arrive.     A soft knock on your door snaps you out of your thoughts almost jumping at the sudden noise.   “You may come in” you call softly turning towards the door. Expecting your brother or even your mother. Instead in walks your mother’s lady maid Elinda.     “The Queen requests your presence your highness.” A sweet smile lit her face. You had grown up with her right by your mother’s side. You hadn’t realized until now how many within the castle you’d miss. You were leaving your servants your guards surely there wouldn’t be dragon keepers at Raventree hall. You would miss your maid Talisie of all of those outside of your family. Near a sister to you though slightly your senior you’d confided within her more often than not. She is the one who urged you to speak to your mother about your feelings. Though both you and she agreed you hadn’t exactly done that in the smooth way you had hoped for.    “Is it urgent?” You ask as you continue packing your things. Stepping into your room Elinda takes one of your dresses and makes a slight face. It was one absolutely of slight judgment though she would never voice it. How embarrassing it is as she starts refolding it before responding.   “She had not said princess.” She hums at you as she eyes the rest of the clothes you had prepared for your saddlebag. Looking at you once more she gestures slightly towards it as if to say ‘Please let me fix that’. Looking downward face warm you nod and say a quiet and polite thank you. She lets out a small laugh as you turn away quickly and head for your mother.     Down the halls you went though it was day there were still dark cast shadows filling spaces. You narrowly avoided darker halls though it would take you longer to arrive at the Painted Table. Dragonstone was a maze your ancestors making it so on purpose. As a young child upon your arrival you nearly constantly needed a servant to escort you. Every wall seemed the same every door was painted the same obsidian color. It almost feels like such again having constantly exhausted yourself in solving the puzzle of how to stay within sunlight or torchlight alike. Winding around corridors and passing through empty rooms.    Finally the large doors come into view two queens guard await you nodding to you quietly as they heft the heavy doors open for your entrance. You look back as they close it and you only assume they situate themselves quietly to their long post until relieved.   “A raven has come for you my dear” Your mother’s voice calls you from the end of the Painted Table behind you. Turning on your heels smiling you smooth your dress down as you approach her.   “Lord Samwell?” You ask though you already know seeing the parchment with the sigil of house Blackwood in her hand. She nods and laughs slightly looking down at the page.   “He is very pleased to house you and Arcturus.” A teasing lilt in her voice as you finally come within range of reading the parchment she now holds out towards you. She had not kidded you in saying how pleased the lord was. Along with more than. Laughing as you begin reading the words not only honored overjoyed delighted celebrated. On and on this lord had gone and filled the whole page accepting this graciousness from his beloved Queen. Supporters your mother had said? More like the biggest fans. Even Lord Cregan had not accepted her so graciously though a Stark always keeps their promises.   “I take it you are all ready being so eager to leave?” She asks the hint of sadness so clear that she had not tried to hide it. How could she you thought. You suppose you were running away it was not your intention or was it? Though to your mother it must’ve seemed clear that it was such.  “I am.” You say softly looking at her and taking her in wholly. Becoming Queen had befit her her sudden higher command filling every space she now entered. It had not changed her entirely you think. For she will always be your mother.  “Very well then” She takes a deep breath looking you up and down “We shall see you off at sunset riding in the cover of night for most of your journey shall be safer.”   “Yes my Queen” You say briskly holding your hands behind your back almost rocking on your feet. Ready at any moment to turn collect your things and meet with your dragon. You haven’t seen him today your other half he must be antsy for a ride. She gives you a nod of dismissal seeing you almost ready to skip towards your exit. You smile at her turn quickly and leave her side. Not before she however grabs your hand arm falling behind and being tugged towards her. You turn her arms are outstretched in holding your hand. Palm to palm you look at her quizzically before she gives it one tight squeeze and lets you go.  Though you had not asked for forgiveness as you may should have with that one tight squeeze of her soft hand you already knew her answer. She forgives you she understands. It almost calms the storm you feel in your gut choppy waters becoming soft waves. The craving of searching her eyes for acceptance appeased. You nod once more before turning back and exiting the grand doors.      ~     You are almost ready as you approach your dragon Arcturus. The Great Flying Bear they call him. You had claimed him on your 10th birthday you had decided it high time you kept up with your brothers and uncle lest you end up with a pig like they had given Aemond. Though it was not the smartest of decisions everything could have gone badly. You were lucky you sigh as you pat his great big snout once you can reach him.    You had promised a stable boy your age you had known with a grand promise of never-ending sweets. In exchange for a pony and a quiet escort to the King’s Road. Once you had told him why that you were going to claim the Kingswood dragon the boy would have done it simply for the thrill of knowing he had helped. With your plan in action you swiftly and with no disturbance from a gold cloak or king’s guard escaped the Red Keep and continued on your mission.   They say as a young unclaimed dragon Arcturus had kept the company of bears even shared meals with them. Though how true that was you hadn’t known. As he grew stocky and with a great brown snout reminiscent of a bear and wide-bodied he remained within the King’s Wood. Feasting upon stags and any beast he came across alike. It seemed to you that was more likely where he had gotten his name from. However dragons are such unknown and un-tameable creatures maybe feasting with bears as a youngling was not so out of the question.   You had succeeded almost laughably easy with your claim. Soft words in your mother tongue and the offer of a lamb’s leg he had chosen you more so than you him. Though slightly younger than that of Syrax and Caraxes he was still growing larger and larger still. When you had ridden him back to the Dragon Pit that very morning and nearly crash landing. You felt an almost smug sense of pride that he would be larger than Vermax. Even so you had gotten in a great deal of trouble once Arcturus had been secured by the Dragon Keepers.   Your smugness was almost never ending for years to come teasing Jacaerys often. In retort during a flight together he had said Arcturus was not so large as he was just fat. Both you and your dragon corrected his opinion with a quickly dodged dracarys and a game of chase.     A wary servant boy approaches you with the company of a dragon keeper. Carrying your saddle bag he looks from you to the bag to the dragon and then back to you. You smile at him as you step forward. Hefting a large strap over one shoulder and giving a grateful thank you. The dragon keeper quickly aids you in strapping the bag to the side of your dragon. Arcturus paid him no mind too occupied with the pleasant distraction of his rider preparing him for a journey an almost purr rumbling through the great beast.   The sound of gravel scraping together alerts you to another set of footsteps approaching. You break yourself away from giving your dragon soft affection.  “Maybe he will feel more pleased on Riverland soil amongst the other bears.” Jacaerys muses smiling at you. Gods you would miss your brother but with the loss of another you could not stand looking upon the great ocean he had been lost to.   “Oh ha ha.” You roll your eyes as you pull him towards you for an embrace. When had he gotten so much taller than you?   “A jest sister” Jace says to you softly head resting above yours. “We both know where you and he will always belong.”   There is sadness in his voice but his light tone sends hope toward your journey of healing. He swings you back and forth quickly as he had done when you were children. You laugh and swing along with him. You both hear footsteps quickly coming upon both of you. Though you think for a moment you cannot bear to let him go. With a soft pat on his back he slowly releases you from his grasp as he turns to look with you at who joined. Your mother and your little Joffery walking hand in hers lagging slightly behind.   “Are you sure you are ready?” She quizzes you as she comes to a stop in front of you and your brother. You know she is holding back tears as are you. Though you quickly swallow them as you smile at her and swoop down upon Joffrey. Lulling his head backward in laughter as you swing him up and hold him upon your hip. Fingers softly digging into his sides so you may hear his sweet laugh plenty more before you leave.   “Yes my Queen.” You muse holding your little brother’s hand entirely within yours as you dramatically bow forward with him. She rolls her eyes not proper for a Queen but who would tattle? Arcturus? You snort at her with a grin. She shakes her head in pretend disapproval.  Looking in the distance you note the ever-falling sun the moon eager to rise and take its place. Setting Joffrey down where he quickly runs to Jace’s legs and latches on to him you smile.   “I must be on my way.” You say softly sadness falling over all of you. They nod Jace instead picking up Joffrey holding him close and allowing him to be of level sight to you. “You must be a good boy for mother” You say to him smoothing his sweet black curls down as you kiss his forehead.  “And you” You look up towards Jace narrowly “You better stay out of trouble.” You attempt to be stern but your smile cracks as he shakes his head with a smirk.   “Aren’t I always?” He says batting his eyes innocently. You let out a huff shaking your head great seven you hope he doesn’t go find trouble.   He takes a step backward in order to set Jof back down allowing your mother to step forward. She takes your arm in hers and begins to walk you toward your dragon. Both of you take great comfort in the warmth of each other no need for words in the moment. She purses her lips before opening them.  “There is a boy there your age” she begins but quickly you sigh and tilt your head back towards the sky in annoyance.  “Mother-” She quickly interrupts you and tightens her grip as she turns face to face with you.  “He is Lord Samwells son. I hear he is a shy boy though honorable and if-” Now it’s your turn to cut her off with annoyance “Mother I am not looking for a” Before your sentence is finished you quickly trail off as she swiftly takes your face in her hands. Running her thumbs over your cheeks in a most comforting motion. She begins again;  “I only hope” She pauses for a moment as if in thought.”That maybe my daughter can find solace in the Riverlands” She meets her eyes with yours soft and glassy. “If not love” she says quieter “If she is unable to find such within these halls.” She breathes out a breath you hadn’t known she was holding. Her lips held a tight-lined smile to not give way to a tremble. With this you let out a soft “Oh.”  Tilting her head towards the sky she laughs lightly at your sudden realization. Looking back down another squeeze to your cheeks with a wider smile you can only hope yours is ever half as bright. She lets you go brings her arms to her front and gives yours a light push.   “You must go now.”   Nodding you turn towards your brothers. Jace was already there crouched next to Joffrey waving their goodbyes. You give a big wave back before turning towards Arcturus. Tugging on the reins and heaving yourself up to mount him you take a moment to adjust yourself. With a final breath you take a look back at your family. They stand there watching you closely nodding as if to give permission to leave. Turning with only a slight nudge to your beast you begin surging forward on Arcturus. A laugh comes from deep within you as he dives from the steep cliff then suddenly brings you upwards towards the never-ending sky.   With haste and very few bats of his wings you look back at your home at your family standing there already shrinking in the distance. You look forward a nagging feeling in the deep pits of your stomach churning what was near calm waters into a dangerous ocean. Would you come back? A nonsense thought that you shake off the moment it enters your mind. Arcturus surged above the clouds at that exact moment.     a/n hiii first fic please be nice :3 i heard arcturus beaming and my brain went fucking BRRRRR i proof read it as much as I could but if you catch anything please say so! likes and reblogs are appreciated. ive lost my own brother so i apologize for slapping that onto reader and yall. gotta get those feelings out some how lol  I also really really wanted to write what a daughter of rhae relationship would be like she loves her babies :( half of the next part is already written and should come in a few days if yall like it i guess. idk ive been workin.,2024-07-07 23:21:40 GMT

you loved the water but the only thing that you loved more than the sea was your family  ⌗ 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠  rhaenyra targaryen x fem! velaryon! sailor! reader  ⌗ 𝐬𝐨𝐥&#x27;𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐞  okayyyyy so this is def the last part for this little headcannon lol hope you guys have enjoyed it !!  previous part  house of the dragon masterlist  &lt;!-- more --&gt; ⌗ if you could stay away from rhaenyra and daemon for the rest of your life you would. but unfortunately that was not possible unless you were willing to give up your relationship with laena’s children. which you were unwilling to do as they were the last pieces of her that you had left.  ⌗ so here you were docking on the shaws of dragonstone. something you swore you would never do. but after baela and rhaena’s piles of letters to you while you were at sea begging you to vist them. you finally caved.  ⌗ now here you in the embrace of your two nieces. and for a slight moment it felt as if it was just the three of you. until someone cleared their throat. breaking up your intimate moment. you look up to see rhaenyra daemon and their children. walking forward you greet the two adults with gritted teeth. before turning your attention to jace luke and joffery.  ⌗ though it was clear the children were not her deceased brothers. but you did not see the point in punishing innocent children for something that is not their fault. so you would try your best to put side your hate for their mother and be the best aunt you could to them. “I’ve bought them gifts” you said. gesturing to your crew members who were unloading heavy looking trunks. “for all of us?” jace asked surprised as he was not expecting to get anything. to which you nodded with a smile “a trunk for each of you though I will admit I wasn’t to sure what either of you were interested in so I just collected trinkets from my travel”  ⌗ “thank you” the voice of rhaenyra drew your eye’s away from the dark haired boy momentarily. to which you could only curtly nod in response. before you were dragged off into the castle by your two eager nieces. and for the days that followed you spent most of your time with baela rhaena jace and luke. as you shared stories with them about your adventures on the high sea’s and trained and gossiped together. and the rare few moments that you were in the same room as either rhaenyra or daemon. you either ignored them or converse the bare minimum.  ⌗ which infuriated rhaenyra to no end. as she wanted nothing more than to spend time with you and explain herself. she wanted you to know that she loved you. that she wanted you more than anything. and that she didn’t kill your brother. and she was ashamed to admit that she found herself feeling jealous of her children. and how they had forged such a strong bound with you. while she had been trying for years and failed every time.  ⌗ now daemon knew that rhaenyra was in love with you. and he had no problem with it. as he knew deep down inside rhaenyra would never love him the way she loved you. and he was okay with that. their marriage wasn’t one of love. it was one of connivence to protect them from the snakes that lurked. and the two had agreed that once they had smoothed everything over they would convince you to marry them. so you could be rhaenyra’s. and the three of you could rule the kingdom together. like the conquerors reborn.  ⌗ and this plan all came to ahead one night. as you sat awake late at night. looking out across dragonstone from on top of the highest tower in the castle. when you heard two pair’s of footsteps approach you from behind. “please don’t punch me” daemon said from behind you. you didn’t even brother to look at him.  ⌗ “if you know how this will play out why are the two of you bothering” you asked with a long sigh. genuinely curious as to why they were putting in so much effort just for you to change your perception of them. “because I love you” silence. finally turning to face the pair you looked at the princess face. eyes filled with tears ready to spill and skin shining in the moonlight. you couldn’t deny she looked beautiful.  ⌗ “do you hear me I said it’s because I love you!” rhaenyra repeated stepping closer to you. “I heard you the first time but tell me why would I love the woman who had my brother dead” and with that you tried to leave but she caught your hand. “he’s not dead laenor he’s in essos I helped him faked his death so he could live the life he wanted” silence once more. “how do I know you are not lying” you ask your voice nothing more than a whisper. “look me in the eyes and you will see I am telling the truth” and so you did. and you saw not a hint of deception in her eyes. only love.  ⌗ “why didn’t you tell me” you said eyes welling with tears. “we tried to but you wouldn’t listen” daemon butted in. and you could practically hear the eye rolls. “and you love me?” you asked looking at the targayen princess who had now interlocked her fingers with yours. “for as long as I can remember” she said with a smile. “what what about you and…” you questioned looking between the two white haired royals.   ⌗ “a marriage of connivence” daemon stated plainly. and with that you couldn’t help but look at the woman in front of you in a different light. she helped your brother escape to the life he had always dreamed of. “thank you” and with that you drew her into a kiss. and it was as if the world around you had stopped. breaking apart for air the two of you couldn’t help but lean against each others foreheads of support. as if you leg’s were going to give out any minute.  ⌗ “now I know this may be a bit quick but…will you marry me. marry us so we can be the conquerors reborn” the princess ask was more like a whisper as if she was scared to hear your response. as you looked at her with lust fogged eyes. “all you had to do was ask princess” and with that the two of you practically ran to her chamber with daemon in tow. as the two of you enjoyed you night together. and daemon well. he mostly watched.  ⌗ and by early morning preparation were already being made for you to be wed to the two. much to the joy of the children. would jumped to embrace you when they heard the news. and later in the afternoon you were officially wed to daemon and rhaenyra targaryen in the traditions of old valyria.  ⌗ as the years passed your relationship only blossomed. as your love for rhaenyra seemed to only grow by the day. the two of you spending countless night together. and with daemon. and while you did cut down on your adventures at see your wife was more than willing to let you go out and explore. as long as you came home to them. to your family.  ⌗ and on the day of her coronation you and daemon were with her every step of the way. as she was declared queen. and you and daemon king and queen consort. life was perfect and you couldn’t be happier. as you had found the perfect blend of water and fire.,2024-07-07 23:08:59 GMT

8,House of the Dragon,['boundless watches hotd'],fromtheboundlesssea,HOTD Season 2 Episode 4 Live Watch Thoughts&lt;!-- more --&gt; I would love if they redid the opening credits of Game of Thrones in this tapestry style of HotD. Love it so much.  Wish Laena and Rhea would haunt Daemon too. They deserve to haunt him.  Oooo Milly should have been wearing dresses like this instead of that awful yellow dress.  Young Alicent should have haunted Viserys.  OH MY GOSH!!!!! He just beheaded her!!!!! I AM IN SHOCK  BLOOD ON HIS HANDS! “Sad news about the usurper’s son” HE WAS MURDERED  Black goat was ominous.  Oscar! Baby!  King consort? Don’t think that’s the right title.  Aw! Little Oscar looks a little like Rickon’s actor.  Daemon asking a child to kinslay his grandfather. Good lord.  Why is House Tully heads always sickly during a time of war.  DOGS! I think those are Scottish dogs.  Oooooo Alyn and Rhaenys are going to talk!  OH SHE KNOWS?!?!?? She knows now!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!  “Your mother must have been very beautiful.” 🫥 WASN’T RELEVANT!!!!!!?????? Let women be more angry!!!!!!!! No! I wanted Alicent to break it purposefully!  Oh? So Alicent is going to have moontea?  Grand maester is hot not gonna lie. Man this is probably the first time Alicent has had autonomy over her womb for the entirety of the show.  Note how the women of color are the only ones who are allowed to want violence for more than a single scene.  Why could you not have at least focused on Jace’s hand on Baela’s that would have been nice.  Why isn’t Jace placed more in charge? He is the crown prince?  How fast are these ships or did Corlys ride with Rhaenys?  Rhaenyra’s council is honestly doing pretty much the exact thing Viserys’ did.  Asking for people to bend the knee without a dragon really does feel less threatening.  And ooooooo Criston being called Kingmaker.  And Criston listening to the man’s last words while taking the head himself. Very Northern of him.  “That castle is more crippled than I am” is kind of funny tbh.  I hate that the Greens can’t be united. Why can’t they be united after the death of Jaehaerys.  Ooooo does Aegon not speak Valyrian?  Also not Aemond saying something similar to Daemon in the first episode of season 1 So he can speak a little? Just not well? STAY AWAY FROM HER LARYS! OH HE NOTICED! STAY AWAY FROM HER!  I am going to reach through the screen and strangle Larys myself.  No you may not be bold Larys!  Oh interesting she’s saying this to Larys. The trailers made it seem she was talking to Otto.  Is Rhaenyra suited? Literally neither of his children showed any suitability for the throne. “The significance of Viserys’ intentions died with him.” YES IT DID Man Daemon is not having a good time right now.  Oh? Aemond?  Oh? Daemon as Aemond? The heck?  Oh so it wasn’t an American accent?  “Do you now try to make your own claim?” Yes he is.  “A girl child you bounced on your knee.” 🫥 Oh? Is Alys going for him because he looks like Aemond and isn’t sure who she is supposed to be projecting into?  Daemon really is not having a good time. Good lord. This man is getting drugged.  OH THIS IS THE GUY THAT MURDERED SOMEONE ON THE TOUR!  LAENA!!!!!!! Laena serving as a cupbearer!!!!! I AM SCREAMING!!! What were the dragons doing before to be fed?  Why isn’t Aemond on the council?  Why isn’t Alicent and Helaena on the council? Didn’t the book say Aegon listened to them?  Is this the same day?  Also again this is how Viserys was treated. He didn’t really do much either.  VISERYS WAS HARDLY A KING RAT CATCHERS THAT KILLED YOUR GRANDSON!  I like that Aegon still called Alicent his mother. I noticed that Jace seemed to stop calling Rhaenyra that.  Why have I seen Gwayne’s actor? Was he in Witcher? He looks so familiar. I’ll have to look it up later.  And now Rhaenyra is back. That took forever.  And yep Jace is no longer calling her “mother” Jace is really channeling his inner Daemon.  Was it necessary? Alicent isn’t queen anymore? She’s the queen mother? Helaena is the queen?  Your caution isn’t weakness you have literally just not been doing anything.  JACE LACKS THE EXPERIENCE????? SO DO YOU RHAENYRA!  Emma channeling their inner Elsa with that braid though.  Ooooo it’s rather symbolic of Aegon pushing aside his wine thing. Honestly Rhaenyra and Aegon should have been better parallels.  Oh? So Rhaenyra is going to tell Jace the stupid prophecy.  SUNFYRE! Aw Sundyre loves his rider! That’s so cute!  Jace learning the prophecy (which is about an enemy to the NORTH) would have been great to know before he went there.  The prophecy really is stupid.  Like it’s stupid. It’s pointless. It’s lazy storytelling at its finest. And we know that it went nowhere because in the show Arya without a drop of Targ blood is what destroys the enemy to the North.  Did Meleys’ design change?  Old lady Vhagar about to wake! She is so done with people waking her from her nap.  And I hate that that Aegon going to fight wasn’t planned. Rather him acting on his own decision.  Dang Sunfyre is a sure shot with fire.  I hate that this is the one and only time we will get a Sunfyre. I know that Sunfyre was Martin’s favorite.  And ah Aemond is doing this so that he gets glory and proves himself more worthy than Aegon. *sigh* Also props to Aegon for holding on.  Ugh. So they’re having Aemond be the reason his brother is scarred. *sigh* This is the battle that was being hyped up? This is the battle? Didn’t people say it was going to be like Battle of the Bastards level? Because…. Yeah no. No it’s not. This is our second “battle” with dragons fighting and it’s not great.  The Field of Fire was also better.  They were hyping up this battle far too much.  I feel sad that Rhaenys died do not get me wrong but the whole battle just didn’t feel climactic. I didn’t feel like I was on the edge of my seat in the way I was for GoT battles.  That was a cool shot though of Criston tapping the soldier on the shoulder and him crumbling.  How they are treating the Greens is what they did with “Dark” Sansa and the stupid Starkbowl pointless. Utterly pointless.  That was another disappointing episode.  Promo Thoughts I don’t even know.  I don’t understand what they are doing. And I feel like a lot of people will be leaving after this season.

Like fuck him.  Don’t get me wrong he’s still compelling but fuck him. I can’t really distance myself from the dragons who are the real victims of this story and war.  I read the book and I knew what was coming and also didn’t expect to be affected so much by their deaths but as soon as I heard Sunfyre’s wails I started bawling. Like full on.  Meleys’s death? Heartwrenching. Especially because they had those scenes before of both Rhaenys and Aegon with their dragons which actually made me feel for them.  And just the layers of Rhaenys battling her uncle’s and DAUGHTER’S dragon. The fact that Vhagar and Meleys once flew together as Daemon’s and Viserys’s parents’ dragons. It just really hit me and made me feel for them.  Rhaenys accepting her death too was beautiful aegon’s desperation and sunfyre’s suffering oh my god–  It just broke me beyond words.  So fuck Aemond for that cause he sees Vhagar as a weapon not as a creature fucking bonded to him. Even Aegon had a warmer relationship with his dragon.,2024-07-08 10:58:21 GMT

55,House of the Dragon,['aegon ii targaryen'  'tom glynn carney'  'house of the dragon season 2'],holdonmars,I am absolutely heartbroken for Aegon I was feeling for him in every scene like okay he is obviously not a good person but seing him being disregarded by every single person he knows made me feel so sorry for him.  He never wanted the throne but nobody listened nobody cared.  And after he was forced to go through the succession he actually tried to be a somewhat decent king (even when he is painfully clueless and doesn’t know how to rule) because i don’t know maybe he thought that he was finally going to earn respect and love from his family but his efforts meant nothing still nobody cared.  I think something shifted inside of him when he was crowned because when he looked back at his family he found recognition (or so he thought) and with that he found a purpose maybe he was worth something maybe he could be a good king maybe his father did love him!  But everything that happened after that only shows him that literally no one is on his side not even after losing his son like he TRULY believed for a second his dad made him king and then Otto hit him with the reality card but oh well his mom still believes in him right right????  he is put in the throne against his will and when he not only shows up but actually tries to do his job he is once again ignored and told to do nothing because they believe him worthless of course he is irrational and impulsive he is a child looking for attention the hurt and confusion in his eyes truly made my heart ache for him and you can’t blame me for it  I don’t know if this makes any sense because a. english is not my first language and i probably wrote a ton of grammatical errors b. it’s just my opinion pls don’t come for me i haven’t read the books and my opinion is based on the show and TGC portrayal of Aegon and c. i know he is a anything but a good brother husband and person but im just taking a tiny part of his persona and making an opinion ok thanks byeeeeee,2024-07-08 10:49:30 GMT

25,House of the Dragon,['hotd critical'  'rhaenys targaryen'  'meleys'],paradiscake,Scorpions were cranked upward to loose iron bolts of the sort that had once felled Meraxes in Dorne. Meleys suffered a score of hits but the arrows only served to make her angry.     Princess Rhaenys made no attempt to flee. With a glad cry and a crack of her whip she turned Meleys toward the foe. Against Vhagar alone she might have had some chance but against Vhagar and Sunfyre together doom was certain.      The crimson jaws of Meleys closed round Sunfyre’s golden neck for a moment till Vhagar fell upon them from above. All three beasts went spinning toward the ground. They struck the ground so hard that stones fell from the battlements of Rook’s Rest half a league away.     The wing all but torn from his body by Meleys jutted at an awkward angle whilst fresh scars along his back still smoked and bled when he moved  Fire and Blood  They really did Rhaenys and Meleys dirty. Meleys was injured and it was said she could still take Vhagar. And it was Meleys who destroyed Sunfyre not Vhagar. Vhagar could only catch Meleys because she was tangled with Sunfyre. Not because she could do a “surprise!”  Rhaenys went with a bang in the book and HotD took that away from her.  And maybe it’s just me but the largest dragon using surprise attack is incredibly ridiculous.,2024-07-08 12:59:31 GMT

24,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'rhaenyra targaryen'  'hotd critical'],allovesthings,Can we talk about how they actually managed to undermine that moment right here with Rhaenyra in season 2 :  I thought we all agreed war was the entire point of that moment. Luke was supposed to be the starting point for Rhaenyra in the show. Why did they suddenly replace that moment with a nonsensical scene in the Sept ?  What happened to that Rhaenyra ?   I saw the argument that she is trying to protect the rest of her children but at this point war might kill them but peace ? Peace condemns them for sure. Aegon would have to kill all of them so he could rule without Jace or Joffrey or Aegon or Viserys claiming theirs right (which they fully have at this point in the system they are in they are the actual heirs).,2024-07-08 12:57:58 GMT

I just find it amusing at how the greens keep calling Rhaenyra a “whore of dragonstone” when their righteous queen dowager not only fucks her shitty guard dog but also gets rid of the product of her own indulgence. And please don’t be pulling that “Oh but she’s a victim in all this she’s innocent blah blah blah.” Honey no…she knows exactly what she’s doing so that argument doesn’t apply in this scene. I also find it cringey at how some people find the affair between Crispy and Alicent romantic like…????  Hail Aegon the useless lame and stupid Targaryen. I do love Tom Glynn-Carney but this is the dumbest Aegon has ever been. I swear to the gods I was laughing the whole time when Aemond read him to filth in High Valyrian and he only realized that no one takes him seriously as king now? Even his own mother admits that he’s not half of the king Viserys was and him finally realizing that he’s nothing without Otto is fucking priceless (as much as I hate that old bitch he did the job). Speaking of which when Alicent told Aegon about the “sacrifices that has been made” to put him to the throne tells me that she knew exactly what she was doing I don’t accept and will never accept that bullshit that she misunderstood what Viserys said.  Aegon going to that war with him not having the skills and tactics Aemond has is bold of him but crazy in a really stupid way. I’ve said it a couple of times at how pathetic he was but this is next level. Rhaenys would have effortlessly shredded him and his dragon into pieces if it weren’t for Aemond and Vhagar although I feel bad for Sunfyre because this beautiful boy do not deserve it.   I knew Rhaenys was gonna die but watching it unfold breaks my heart. She knew it was impossible to fight Vhagar on her own but she fought like a true dragon rider. I’m gonna miss seeing Eve Best in the show but her performance as Rhaenys Targaryen will always be iconic.   Daemon still being haunted by the young Rhaenyra questioning his true intentions his mirrored path with Aemond his dead ex-wife appearing before him perhaps a reflection of his guilt for moving on so quickly and not even processing his grief before marrying Rhaenyra. Alys Rivers taunting him about his wife–damn that castle is fucking his mind. I also sense that Alys was trying to seduce Daemon which I don’t think ever happened in the book (Alys and Aemond did have a thing though) but maybe it’s just me. But also felt like hopefully it will push him to get his shit together and fight for his wife’s cause.  Aemond obviously hates his brother for not only tormenting him since childhood but also having everything he does not deserve. He’s smart skilled and a damn good warrior. It shows he shoved it right to Aegon’s face that he would make a better king than him. We all know Aegon is not gonna die…yet but he would be performing his duties and responsibilities as Prince Regent and possibly…an affair with Helaena? The latter never happened in the book but what if?  I actually thought that Rhaenyra was gonna confess to Jace that his real dad is Crispy Cole hahahahaha!

37,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'aemond targaryen'  'aegon ii targaryen'  'criston cole'  'alicent hightower'  'sunfyre'  'vhagar'],pterodactylterrace,Unapologetically Team Green Take:  Alicent   Ok I’m going to call it now. They decided Maelor being Aegon and Helaena’s child was green propaganda. In F&amp;B Helaena couldn’t even care for herself let alone her remaining children.  Aegon allegedly gives Maelor to his mother to raise as her own. No mention of the surviving twin being given the same treatment. They will likely decide to give Alicent at least one bastard just to drive home the feeling of “see? Evil hypocrite!” Even though Alicent is a widow and not putting her illegitimate son in the succession.  It was rumored that Daeron would be an Alicole bastard but then how in the fuck did he hatch his dragon? I’m getting the vibe that Tessarion was hatched to Daeron which wouldn’t be possible unless Viserys was his father. I can already hear Condal now “everyone kind of forgot that only Targaryens can hatch a dragon egg” “it’s green propaganda that only Targaryens can claim dragons”   Just waiting for all the “Alicent is a hypocrite and a slut!” Hate to start rolling in. The only issue is that her paramour is a member of the kingsguard. And he is willingly breaking his vow. A vow Aegon doesn’t seem to even really care about that much. It sounded more like a suggestion when he told his kingsguard pal that he was supposed to be celibate. Plus isn’t the vow that they would father no children not that they wouldn’t get their freak on? I mean maybe it’s splitting hairs but the point of the vow is that they won’t have anyone or anything else they would put before their duty. Isn’t it kind of null and void if the resulting child would be a member of the royal family? Not to mention Alicent took Ye Olde Morning After so they are actively preventing him from fathering children. Aemond  Speak High Valaryian between my legs to me  That smooth cool voice just effortlessly tearing into Aegon. That had no business being THAT hot.  It’s nice to know Aegon wasn’t planned on being there. At least they have some sort of brain in their heads.  My take is that Aemond gave Aegon a chance and came to his aid when it was clear he couldn’t win on his own. I also prefer to think that he didn’t mean to roast his brother.   We see Aemond walking around the crash site with his sword out. He is in the process of sheathing his sword when Cole approaches.   He exchanges no words just points to where his brother and Sunfyre are.  My guess is they will try to frame it as “Aegon was a big dumb dummy and we needed him out of the way” Aegon  He is so upset no one is listening to him. Can’t say I blame him.  His broken HV 😭 especially in comparison to Aemond’s easy grasp of the language.  “Mom why are you in my room?”  Alicent has no idea the morning her son has had and her words are most certainly what pushes him over the edge.  The little kitty cat bapping of the pitcher off the table 😭  OH MY STARS AND GARTERS THE SUNFYRE BOND!!!   Just a happy golden boi giving his rider a chest boop with his snoot. I may never recover from this. This is how I imagine TGC greets his dog when he gets home.  Sunfyre doesn’t need HV commands he knows what Aegon wants. (Lemme guess Condal Sunfyre just kind of forgot dragons only understand HV it’s not because of their bond)  Golden Boi doing his absolute bestest!!! Poor baby has 0 battle experience. What he does have is a drunk rider and a can do attitude!  Maybe drunken dragon fighting was a bad idea?  The golden flames tho!!!! Cole  Finally using his head for more than something to put his helm on.   It was a good plan. Kudos for the thought that went into it. Unfortunately no one accounted for Aegon drinking and flying.   Not Gwayne instantly thinking Cole planned on Aegon showing up at the exact worst possible time.   Riding hard to get to Aegon even as Aemond and Rhaenys fight overhead.  First thing he does when he regains consciousness is resume his search for Aegon.  Falling to his knees when he sees his eldest surrogate son burned and broken after his first taste of battle. He may not fully respect Aegon’s authority but he still cares for him as a person. As his son. Sunfyre:  WE WERE ROBBED  We needed more Sunfyre! He has been on screen for like two minutes but in those two minutes he showed so much personality. The boop! THE BOOP!!!!  He throws up a wing against Vhagar’s flame to protect Aegon.  When they fall sunfyre curls around Aegon to protect him. Vhagar   How TF did they manage to hide a mountain of a dragon in the woods?   She is a real one for that nap though 😂  Aemond said “wait” and she was like “thank FUCK!” And just flopped back down for a snooze.  How is this giant somehow also a master of stealth?  I understand Meyles being able to sneak up on Sunfyre she is a very fast dragon but Vhagar is noted to be slow.  But somehow she just manages to pop out of nowhere and snack on other dragons no problem.  Grabbing Meyles by the leg and roasting her. Grandma knows how to handle these hatchlings! Conclusion: Can we please have more focus on the dragons in a show about war between dragon riders? They are more than just transportation devices. They have personalities. I WANT TO SEE MORE OF THAT. Not more Syrax and Caraxes. Syrax is less of a dragon and more of a chicken pony and we have seen the noodle boi so much. Show us the Green dragons FFS. They have less. It should be easier to show all of theirs but instead we are constantly shown the dragons being used to patrol or transport the blacks. The one other time we see Vhagar it’s from miles away while she is patrolling KL. Also why are none of these riders practicing evasive tactics? That seems really important. Instead they just fly at one another clash lock and bunny kick the shit out of their opponent.   I would just love to see them actually doing something with their dragons other than just using them as horses.,2024-07-08 15:47:16 GMT

Luke’s death being an “accident” doesn’t change his culpability he wanted to terrorise him and took it to far he’s still 100% responsible.   all this being said i do think having him purposely take out Aegon was an unjustifiable character decision that goes against what we’ve seen of him previously which is despite hating his brother he’s still loyal to him maybe if there was a confrontation after Jaehaerys death but would be more believable but up until this point Aegon has been Aemonds biggest supporter and him drunkenly mocking him is not a good enough reason to justify having him killAegon.   a better more cohesive arc for Aemond would be him being driven by guilt over Luke’s death and what it did to his family for not being able to save Aegon for failing. his single minded need to kill Daemon and take out the biggest threat to his family and in doing so trying to redeem himself but failing miserably.,2024-07-08 16:59:59 GMT

It would make more sense to some degree.  2-The character development of everyone  me and I’m pretty sure everyone else expected better. Making Aegon a r*pist was not something I had on my watchlist. They should’ve gave us him flying around the city with sunfyre.   3- The B&amp;C scene. The acting was great but they should’ve stayed with the book.  4-The writers making Rhaenicent more tragic than the death of characters. Like Jaehaerys went hi and bye.,2024-07-08 16:54:41 GMT

That women ate either unhinged harpies or sex-maniacs with the worst timing possible? Which is it?  Alicent arrives late to a council because she is fucking her employee.  Criston Cole fails to protect Queen Helaena and her children because he is fucking Alicent.  Alicent misses a council meeting because she is having a secret abortion…  That’s Alicent now her whole character is defined by her sex life and her sex life keeps causing problems to everyone.

22,House of the Dragon,['aemond targaryen'  'rhaenys targaryen'  'dance of the dragons'  "battle at rook's rest"  'aegon ii targaryen'  'alys rivers'],andreadesantis3806,The fact that Rhaenyra was right in her restraint to try and not send the dragons to war. “When dragons flew to war everything burned.” She is right. We saw this episode as a clear proof soldiers and bannermen will fight lose fight fall upon swords fire canyons all day but the moment a dragon or two appears they are no friends or foes they become one whole collateral damage and the battle ground is nothing compared to the now actual battle happening ove there heads. Dragon fire does not distinguish between friends or foes; it just…burns. The soldiers below; mere mortals can do nothing but get drenched in the rain of blood showering from the sky as Sunfyre and Meleys grapple at each other cannot do anthing but move away as far as they can from the jets of flames cannot do anything but panic and run as Meleys throws Vhagar down on the ground; the humongous form of the biggest dragon in the known world squishing everyone and everything like a boulder thrown atop a bed of flowers They cannot do anything but run and scamper out of the way as Vhagar hauls hereslf up bounding across the field to fly up her wing talons and feet squishing people like ants. They cannot do anythign but watch as Meleys crashes on a castle and completely destroys the side of it.   That is why restraint is a very necessary element when it comes to a war involving dragons as Condal said. Impulsiveness or just pure unadulterated fury on dragon back has consequences that ripple through the entire Realm. But they are Targaryens. Their blood runs hot like the flames of their dragons they are restless and chaotic. They know restraint but not necessarily knows how to do so.  Also another thing if they make the Hull brothers sired from Corlys how are they dragon riders? Corlys is a Velaryon wheraes Laenor was half-Targaryen so it makes sense to have them hail from Laenor despite his preferences. But dunno there might be some targaryen ancestry in Corlys’ line as Targaryens and Velaryons are often known to mingle most than other houses idk.  Also AEMOND’S VALYRIAN? AEGON’S HALF ASSED ATTEMPT TO ASSERT DOMINANCE ONLY TO SPEAK ABSOLUTE GIBBERISH?? I CACKLED.  BUT NO I NEED RHAENYS BACK IF ONLY TO HOLD RHAENYRA BACK FROM DOING ERRATIC SHIT AS SHE WAS THE WISEST COUNCIL SHE HAD.

2,House of the Dragon,['hotd'],silver-and-stars,Do I feel bad for Aegon even a tiny bit ? No because I remember he is a serial rapist who enjoys seeing his bastard children fight in pits.  But I do feel bad for Sunfyre !  Rhaenys knew it was over the moment Vhaegar appeared. It was a suicide attack aimed to deal as much damage as possible before falling in hopes to debilitate Vhaegar enough to have Aemond leave the fight  And Rhaenys… Meleys looked at her died they were falling and she let go still strapped to her. She knew that was it and there was no point in fighting it in panicking. It was already over.  And this was when ALL was already over. A Targaryen set his dragon on another’s Targaryen’s dragon this time on purpose. Another dragon an old one was dead. War between dragons. The wheel was set into motion the extinction of dragons and thus of House Targaryen was cemented this day.  Also what bad luck hat Meleys felt ON the castle creating a breach ! Her intervention didn’t help at all (except if you considered Aegon being down but that’s thanks to Aemond). Instead Team Black lost its biggest dragon and its wisest member.

After last week’s episode I thought that I was about to completely detach myself from HotD storyline - and guess what? After watching this one I decided to do just that.  Having Alicent talk to Aegon like he is a piece of dirt on her shoe? Putting Rhaenyra’s voiceover of this thrice damned prophecy over the 10 seconds of Aegon&amp;Sunfyre interaction that we saw? Making the Rook’s Rest into one of the most jumbled battle sequences I can remember watching with absolutely anticlimactic focal points? Having Aegon arrive at the battlefield a drunk mess (I completely understand why he snapped and don’t judge him but it hardly makes things better) instead of the true king leading his people - and in general making him look as pathetic as possible? Having Aemond giving absolutely zero fucks about his brother (because that’s what I saw both in the air and on the ground - not the desire to kill Aegon but complete indifference to his fate)?  From now on I’m watching this excuse of a TV show only for the actors’ performances (thankfully I have an experience in separating the acting from the plot and enjoying the former while ignoring the latter). I am particularly excited for Aemond’s immaculate vibes (they finally were back in full swing in ep4). Ewan the man that you are. They will make you (Aemond that is) do the most horrible shit but at least I’m pretty sure you will serve doing it - as you should.

With a glad cry and a crack of her whip she turned Meleys toward the foe. Against Vhagar alone she might have had some chance but against Vhagar and Sunfyre together doom was certain. The dragons met violently a thousand feet above the field of battle as balls of fire burst and blossomed so bright that men swore later that the sky was full of suns. The crimson jaws of Meleys closed round Sunfyre’s golden neck for a moment till Vhagar fell upon them from above. All three beasts went spinning toward the ground. They struck the ground so hard that stones fell from the battlements of Rook’s Rest half a league away.  Those closest to the dragons did not live to tell the tale. Those farther off could not see for the flame and smoke. It was hours before the fires guttered out. But from those ashes only Vhagar rose unharmed. Meleys was dead broken by the fall and ripped to pieces upon the ground. And Sunfyre that splendid golden beast had one wing half torn from his body whilst his royal rider had suffered broken ribs a broken hip and burns that covered half his body. His left arm was the worst. The dragonflame had burned so hot that the king’s armor had melted into his flesh.  A body believed to be Rhaenys Targaryen was later found beside the carcass of her dragon but it was so blackened that no one could be sure it was her.

No way in HELL would Laena say that to Daemon she would smack him for neglecting her daughters then punch him for good measure! so laena is just a hallucination of what Daemon wants to hear or believes he should be hearing.  Either way they could never make me hate you Laena!! 🫂🥹,2024-07-08 19:46:57 GMT

Aemond uses Vhaegar as a weapon for his own masochistic desires they are not true companions like we see with other dragon/Targaryen pairings in the show and that has caused so many senseless deaths. It also just makes me so sad for Vhaegar.,2024-07-08 19:46:47 GMT

Loved Jace’s reaction to his mother risking her life to visit Alicent in King’s Landing. Like he was saying „I knew you had a weird relationship with Alicent - but I did not know you were that obsessed!“   Speaking of Alicent - I hope she continues this development…  She is going through books obviously looking for the story that Rhaenyra claimed Viserys was really talking about. So their meeting in the sept has put something in motion inside of her. Though she is telling Larys that it does not really matter and Visery’s intentions died with him - as she keeps on looking for his books it obviously matters to her on a personal level. I guess she is starting to doubt everything she used to believe in and especially her role in all of this. Very interesting conversation with Larys anyway. Him saying that she seemed different lately and her explaining this with grieve… This backs the interpretation that Alicent’s sudden affair with Criston was a reaction to all the stress she was going through. Just googled and found out sex really is a common coping mechanism: „An increase in desire for sex can ironically be used as a way to avoid feeling.“ As Helaena was also talking to Alicent about grieve the episode before it seems established now that this is what really drove Alicent to Criston. Not romance. Sorry Criston does not matter how loudly you ask for her favor… Larys is also asking her if she is worried about Criston being in battle. Obviously he is mocking her asking these questions while knowing she just took an abortion tea. However her unemotional reaction once again gave me the feeling that she really does not care at all. I thought her going through the whole abortion process could also be her symbolically ending this affair and phase in her life once and for all. I certainly hope so… While she is talking to Aegon I found her frustration quite entertaining. Looks like she put aside any will to talk sweetly (though that never was her way of talking with Aegon I guess) or even just being diplomatic. However I guess it wasn’t just her frustration about Aegon and his inability to be a good king but also her frustration about her own isolated position. Some of his complaints like how he was treated in council could have been her own complaints. However she is too fed up with all of this to even try to empathize.  „You have no idea what sacrifices were made to put you on that throne“ - leaves room for speculations about what she means. Who exactly sacrificed what? If she is talking about herself which is most likely I guess the one thing she has really sacrificed is Rhaenyra. Rhaenyra as a person as Alicent actively contributed to robbing her throne thus humiliated her and put her In constant death threat - but also Rhaenyra as her former love. Throughout all these years Alicent has been trying to suppress any feelings of sympathy for Rhaenyra trying so hard to turn love into hate trying to be a person so dutiful and pure that it would justify her breaking with Rhaenyra on a higher level - only to find out that she just can’t kill the feeling nor let Rhaenyra being killed no matter what! She has destroyed the life of a woman she loved their relationship and even herself. Now she knows that she has sacrificed it all - for what? Her idiotic son on the throne and a war that is about to kill them all.,2024-07-08 19:46:41 GMT

21,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'corlys velaryon'  'rhaenys targaryen'  'hotd critical'],spirit-meets-the-b0ne,Not for nothing but Corlys Velaryon and Rhaenys deserved so much better for an adaptation focusing on their family and the Dance. It’s been said before but the time skips were so destructive to character development. If the series had started around the adolescents of Daemon Vizzy T Corlys and Rhaenys a lot of these issues and confusions could have been avoided. I mean Corlys has some of the most incredible content behind his character even before he became Lord of the Tides. He traveled extensively around not only Westeros but Essos even as far as the Jade Sea and Asshai which would have been really fun to explore as an audience member. Or the fact that his journeys made him so rich that he effectively built his own throne at High Tide and subsequently Hull and Spicetown. Gasp an asiof character using their wealth for the betterment of their people? I know! Corlys’ glory days could have given us as such great content and funny “fisherman tales” that get back to the mainland of his adventures. It also would have been inherently better to explore the relationship between him and Rhaenys as well as the impact of the Great Council of 101. I’m so sorry these two will likely never get the character recognition they deserve.,2024-07-08 20:56:55 GMT

Like yeah that scene with Aemond in the council meeting spitting High Valyrian in circles around him is obviously meant to embarrass him but I think it also speaks to his otherness from the rest of his royal family. Here he is this dude who has never had anything expected of him his whole life here he is as king. He’s spent his life in hedonistic pleasure with no repercussions but he’s also spent probably more time than any Targaryen in a century with non-nobles. He’s done it as an act of slumming but when push comes to shove he finds himself on the throne wanting to provide for the smallfolk so they will be happy because they’re His People (and so they’ll validate him) like sure there’s selfishness there but damn I wonder the good he could have done as king if he were at all prepared by anyone who cared about him as anything other than a pawn.

86,House of the Dragon,['alicent hightower'  'rhaenyra targaryen'  'hotd critical'  'hotd'],thekinslayers,Both Alicent and Rhaenyra using Viserys’ words as a cloak of justification to moralise their actions and gaslight themselves into believing that their cause is noble and for the greater good would be so much better if the writers were brave enough to actually portray it as such give some moral ambiguity to their female characters.   At least with Alicent they did made a shoddy effort to pull the mask and now she needs to face the reality that she was ambitious and did want the power and the throne all along for whatever selfish reasons or otherwise. But I highly doubt that they will take that direction with Rhaenyra.   You cannot try to depict the horrors of the war while also trying to uphold the ones responsible for it as noble and helpless in their cause. Let them be ambitious and selfish enough to plunge the realm into a war. The narrative that it’s inevitable for the “greater good” is not holding up at this point.

They really captured the scale of the power the Targaryens have over *everyone* just by the virtue of riding these nuclear weapons. To their medieval audience it must have been like watching gods fight in the sky   I really feel for Criston Cole the most after Aegon in this episode. His plan (like the majority of his battle tactics we’ve seen so far) was an excellent one. Lure a dragon rider from Rhaenerya’s side by presenting a straightforward battlefield and then have Aemond on Vhaegor leap out and snap them up   And then what happens? His king flys in on a dragon far too small to fight Meleys and all he can do is freak out like a small bean on the ground because he has no dragon and Aemond takes his time flying in before barbecuing his own brother.   Ewan Mitchell is killing it with his portrayal of a villain as Aemond. His actions…don’t make sense unless he was steaming drunk because he literally shot a flamethrower at his king in full sight of an entire army when Meleys was nowhere nearby. Still the acting is excellent!,2024-07-08 22:45:33 GMT

You’d wanted to be a journalist for as long as you could remember but this wasn’t quite what you’d imagined yourself doing–wrangling puppies while waiting for your interview subjects to arrive.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; “She’s a clever one isn’t she?” you hear a deep amused voice say from behind you.   “I wouldn’t give her too much credit I’m sure Daisy and Willow helped her out” you reply your eyes unexpectedly meeting curious hazel ones. “Is everything okay?”  His brows furrow “Of course why wouldn’t it be?”  You glance down at your phone holding the wriggly puppy closer to your chest to avoid a kamikaze situation. “Because no one’s due on set for another half hour.”   “I can leave if you’d like” he offers his smile turning uncertain.   “No of course not” you shake your head offering your free hand to him “I’m Y/N it’s nice to meet you.”   “Matt lovely to meet you. I couldn’t resist coming out to get some extra time with these little guys” he grins releasing your hand only to hold his palms up. “Clover right?”  “Yes she’s litter mates with Willow and Daisy” you reply pointing them out in their pen after handing Clover to him. “And then there’s Leo Frankie and Gertrude. They’re all from different litters the last of their siblings in the shelter.”  “Poor little things” Matt coos gently placing Clover back where she belongs before reaching down to grab one of the strays.  “Wait no not her” you jump in scooping Gertrude into your arms before Matt can.   “Is she nippy or something?” he asks head quirking in confusion.   “No I think I might be taking her home today. I wouldn’t want you to get too attached.”   Matt throws his head back in laughter “Hazards of the job I suppose?”  “Kind of” you shrug gently stroking Gertrude’s soft fur. “My roommate’s been begging for a pet for months now and little Trudy here is just too sweet.” Seemingly in response the little dog lifts her head to briefly lick your chin before settling in for a nap in your arms.   “Now that is too precious” Matt says smiling softly and retrieving his phone from his pocket. “Want me to take a photo?”   “I’m sure I look a mess I’ve been running around all morning” you laugh.  “Nonsense you look great. Trust me you’ll want this–smile!” he cheers and you laugh looking into the camera. “Gorgeous” he compliments and you ignore the swoop of your stomach.   “Let me see” you request moving to his side as he angles his screen towards you. You’re pleasantly surprised to see that while you look flushed from running around your hair and makeup have miraculously stayed in place. “Aw doesn’t she look too cute? All tuckered out already.”   “What’s your number? I can forward you this if you’d like” he offers and you do something you’ve never done before–flirt with a guest.  “If you wanted my number you could’ve just asked from the get go” you tease eyes flicking up to meet his.  His smile curls up higher on one side “Well you see now I’ll have your number and this beautiful photo for your contact.”  “Well played then” you reply listing off your number for him. You felt your phone vibrate in your pocket but don’t move from his side.   “How long have you been working with Buzzfeed?” he questions turning to face you directly.   “A little over a year it’s certainly a unique place to have landed.”   “You don’t like it” he replies instantly and your eyes widen.  “I didn’t say that…”  “But it’s what you mean no?” he pushes not breaking eye contact.   “Why are you aiming to take my job?”   He chuckles and shakes his head not offering you a way out except to answer the question.   “I’m a writer. So ideally one of my books or screenplays end up in the right hands. Or if not I’d really like to do print work. Spending lots of time with someone or a group of someones and writing a more in depth piece about their process the work whatever. Like we got the screener for the first half of this season right? You know how many questions I want to ask about the cinematography or an acting choice or a certain shot? Instead we have these cutesy questions prepared.”   That makes him laugh but you feel vulnerable exposed after offering so much to a stranger especially one you’re meeting at work. “I’m sorry that wasn’t professional of me. I really do appreciate this job.”   “Hey no apologies. I’m the one that asked aren’t I? I appreciate your honesty.”  You nod a slightly awkward silence descending between you. Matt breaks it by leaning down to pick up Leo who promptly bites his finger.   “Shit are you okay?” you ask biting your lips to repress the laugh bubbling up in your chest. Matt’s face is the portrait of shock and outrage even though you can tell Leo’s teeth barely broke his skin.   “I think I’m alright” he replies seriously inspecting his finger and a little giggle escapes your mouth. His eyes leap up to yours and his frown deepens at the amusement he sees on your face. “Well go on then.”  At his begrudging permission you burst into laughter settling a now grumpy Gertrude into her pen. You make your way back to where the first aid kit is your sides turning sore from laughter that won’t cease. You wave Matt over and he morosely makes his way to you plopping down in the seat you direct him towards.   “I’m sorry” you offer as you sit opposite him unzipping the bag. “It’s really not even that funny but now I just have the giggles.”   “You’re forgiven if only because your laugh is the most joyous sound I’ve heard all day.”  His compliment does what his annoyance couldn’t–rips the laughter from your throat. You gaze into his eyes expecting to see jest but find none. “That’s kind of you.”  “It’s the truth.”  A different kind of tension simmers in this silence. “May I?” you request reaching for him. His calloused hand lands in yours and you lean closer inspecting the tiny cut on his pointer finger. You pull an alcohol wipe from the kit and wrap it as gently as you can around his cut before quickly replacing it with a bandage. “Good as new.”   “You could look into nursing you know” he responds gently and you meet his intense gaze. The moment seems to stretch eternally with you lost in the green and brown shades of his eyes. A door slams open jarring you two apart and making you realize you’d been holding onto his hand just as it slips away.   “Looks like it’s show time” you force a smile as you stand. “Think you can manage with this grievous injury?”  He returns your smile nodding “I think so but have the medics on standby just in case.”   *** Luckily the interview goes smoothly jokes being made all around at Matt’s injury and another round unleashing when he’s nipped again while filming. As you drive home Gertrude beside you you work to convince yourself you’d been imagining things. That Matt had simply been friendly and naturally charismatic not that there’d been any kind of spark. And that he most definitely hadn’t lingered after you’d thanked him and his castmates eyes boring into your back before finally following them out onto the New York City streets. And you certainly weren’t still lost in those thoughts as you placed the wiggly puppy in your roommate Sage’s arms.   “She’s perfect isn’t she?”   “She almost got swept up by Matt Smith” you joke and her eyes widen.  “I forgot that was today how was it?”  “Good everything went smoothly.”   “…but?”   “But what?”   “But why does your face look like that?”  “Fuck you it was a long day.”   “Bullshit” she argues and you glare at her. “I’ll wait.”  “I was just deluding myself that’s all.” She waits expectantly and you sigh throwing up your hands. “I had myself half convinced that Matt Smith tried to sweep me up.”   “Tell me everything.”   And you would have if your phone didn’t buzz in your pocket. Sage pointedly rolls her eyes as you pause the conversation to check your phone just in case it’s a work issue. Your heart drops which must’ve reflected on your face because she’s beside you reading over your shoulder a second later.  Hi it’s Matt  Well you know that obviously.   I mean to ask are you free tonight?   “Tell me everything right the fuck now Y/N/N or I swear to God.” You quickly fill her in all while attempting to decide what to do. “Just answer see why he’s asking.”  “Wouldn’t it be a conflict of interest?”  The look Sage shoots you could melt steel “Respectfully you primarily do puppy interviews at Buzzfeed. Answer him.” You couldn’t argue with her logic even though you wanted to.  I just got home but have nothing in the books. Why do you ask?  Would you want to meet with us at a pub near our hotel? Everyone loved working with you.   Who’s everyone?   You do love questions don’t you?   Emboldened by having a screen between you you allow him to see you’d read the message on What’s App but don’t type a reply. Within a moment he begins typing again:  All of us but especially me.   One condition  Anything.   I can ask you about the Harrenhal sequences  Off the record of course  That’s all? You shouldn’t be thinking so small.   I want to make sure I have you in my thrall a bit more before asking for your banking information.   Can we compromise with drinks on me?  Text me the place and time and I’ll see if I can make it  *** “I knew you were bullshitting us.” Fabien cackles from beside Matt who rolls his eyes for what feels like the hundredth time already tonight.  “Lay off him Fabs he’s about to be stood up after all” Olivia replies doing a terrible job of hiding her own laughter.   “It’s only half past. She’s a New Yorker it’d have been weird if she showed up exactly at 9…maybe she’s nervous?” Emma offers.   “What about meeting up with the Great Matthew Smith for drinks?” Fabien retorts and even Emma can’t fight their smile at his expense.   “Thank god I have you lot to keep me humble” Matt grumbles getting up and stalking over to the bar to get another round. He sighs to himself scrubbing his hands down his face as he waits for the bartender to mix his drink.   He knew it had been a bad idea to text you. You were simply being professional and he’d unfairly pushed you into meeting up for a drink. It had been Emma’s idea to have the whole group there so it felt less like a date sensing his unease about asking you out directly. Their advice was much more helpful than Fabien’s goading and Olivia enthusiastically endorsed Emma’s plan if only to be able to snoop.  He grabs his drink and begins heading back to the booth when your distinctive laughter makes his steps briefly falter. Nerves flood his system and he rolls his eyes at himself. You’re acting like a schoolboy he chastises but he can’t help himself. He feels drawn to you in a way he hasn’t felt to anyone else in a long long time. As he rounds the corner his eyes find yours immediately. Unsurprisingly his friends have placed you right beside his vacant spot which he is both grateful for and exacerbated by–again so secondary school of them all.   “Hey you made it!” he exclaims as he sits beside you.   “I’m sorry I’m a bit late Sage took far too long at the petstore getting Miss Trudy’s supplies. Oh wait how’d you know I love vodka crans? What a gentleman” you grin plucking the drink from his hands and taking a deep sip.   “Just another thing we have in common it appears.”   “In addition to?”   “Our love of dogs of course.”  “Ah if only the dogs loved him back” Olivia goads and you let loose another glorious giggle.   “How are your wounds doing?” you tease eyes sparkling in the dim light.   “Fine for now but I may need a skilled medic later to assist with bandage changes.”  “I suppose I could help if you can’t find anyone with the proper training.”   “Very generous of you Y/N.”   “I aim to serve. Also here I wouldn’t want to actually steal your whole drink” you acquiesced sliding the drink into his waiting hand. He lifts the glass to his mouth taking a long sip while your eyes bore into his. You have such an unflinching way of appraising people remaining present even while nothing’s being said and he’s entranced by this.   “I don’t mind sharing” he replies quietly gently grasping your hand and easing the glass back into it. He doesn’t release your hand or your gaze and for once his friends around the table are silent which he would’ve previously believed to be impossible. He faintly hears Emma and Olivia excusing themselves to the restroom as Fabien chugs his beer just to go refill it.   “We really cleared the table huh?” Your faint words barely reach him despite your closeness.   “All the better if you ask me” he replies heart thumping at the grin his comment earns.   “Do you do this often?” you ask head tilting and eyes sharp.   “Do what?”  “Charm women you meet in your line of work?”   He can’t fight the smile that splits his face–he could banter with you for eternity he fears. “No of course not. I have a reputation to uphold after all.”   “What reputation?”  “Are you implying my gentlemanly reputation doesn’t proceed me?”  “Are you implying you’re of such stature I looked into you before today?”   “I’d assumed you were good at your job but you can correct me if I’m wrong.”   “I am excellent at my job” you retort eyes narrowing dangerously.   “Well then what’s my reputation?”  “You’re a classic Scorpio.”  “What?” he asks genuinely perplexed. He notes the smirk that quirks your lips–you’d intended to throw him off his game. Well played then.  “Scorpios are charming easily pulling people into their orbit. But they also tend to be deep thinkers who hide behind that charisma to keep everyone at a distance despite being surrounded by people.”   He could hardly catch his breath–have you truly seen through him so easily? “Meaning?”  “Meaning that despite being in this business for decades not much is actually known about you. Glowing comments from everyone who’s ever worked with you surface level reporting on a few previous public relationships but nothing of much substance despite the countless interviews and press junkets you’ve done over the years.”   “Does that bother you?”  “No it intrigues me. But it also makes me weary.”   “Why’s that?” he questions heart sinking.   “I may not be doing groundbreaking work right now but I value my career. So much of this business and publishing is based on word of mouth having people speak well of you from previous projects. I’d hate to think this was a fun game for you when it could ruin my credibility.”   He chuckles to himself and your eyes flash. “They had to convince me to ask you out.”  “What?” you recoil at his words and he desperately wants to pull you back to him.  “I knew from our conversation earlier today you have ambitions and I’d never want to come between you and them. You’re insightful and have a sharp mind I’m sure your writing reflects that. But they convinced me I was just giving myself an out so I wouldn’t have to risk your rejection.”  Your head tilts at his words eyes appraising him in a way that lays him bare before you. “I think you were right” you acknowledge. “But so were they.”   He couldn’t tear himself away from you if he tried. He can only guess what’s going on in your head but your eyes reveal how countless thoughts are flowing behind them calculations being drawn up quick decisions being made.   “I love this song” you say quietly throwing back all but a swallow of your shared drink which you then offer to him. “Dance with me?”  He holds your gaze as he slowly consumes the last bits of vodka before extending his hand. “It would be my pleasure.”        So I clearly am incapable of writing a brief meet cute but I can’t help myself. I have loads of ideas where this could go so any feedback would be much appreciated! I’ve never written for actors before but I hope y’all enjoyed 🫶🏻,2024-07-08 22:42:31 GMT

We need to talk.   This entire scene already had me tearing up simply because of Rhaenys’ expressions.   First Rhaenys walks up to the docks tense a stern look on her face. She corrects Alyn about her title taking back control. She’s known for a long time about Corlys’ indiscretion but this is the first time she’s confronted with it face to face. She needs to see for herself.   Alyn struggles to meet her eye whereas Rhaenys keeps studying him as if it could help her understand. She’s had time to process her husband’s betrayal but the scar still itches when irritated. She still doesn’t understand why because he is so devoted to her. Their love is and always has been strong so how could he have done it?   Then the hand to the cheek a tender gesture. Assessing yes but we’ve only seen her do this with Baela and Rhaena before—which is why this was so incredibly meaningful to me.   It’s almost as if she accepts him as her own. He’s Corlys’ child she sees him in Alyn and she knows he’s innocent. And if Rhaenys is anything then protective of her children/grandchildren.  “Your mother must’ve been very beautiful.”  Her husband’s betrayal made her question her own appearance; if she wasn’t comely enough anymore. If she was too old too worn. Considering the love they shared the only explanation for his affair was that the other woman was more beautiful than her so much that he couldn’t resist that he stopped thinking about her if only for a moment.  The little gulp the sadness in her eyes. But there’s no blame no resentment towards Alyn. And that’s what I so deeply admire about Rhaenys. She has so much self control in the face of the greatest pain that she can still see sense can tell right from wrong. She could’ve lashed out at Alyn could’ve asked Corlys to banish him from her sight but instead she stands up for him.  It’s one of Rhaenys’ defining traits: compassion.  All throughout this scene her eyes carry so much hurt. Like she’s dying inside. Eve said “her heart was bleeding.” And it’s so visible.   Corlys comes into the picture. He dances around it not wishing to bring further pain upon his wife who he is already desperately trying to win back after his absence even going to war just to prove his loyalty and devotion to her.   But Rhaenys is clear. She knows. Her eyes glaze with tears and Corlys can’t stand seeing it averts his gaze gets defensive when Rhaenys demands Alyn should be honoured for his deeds despite his origins despite her pride.   It would bring shame on her but she is willing to take it.   She stands by her husband.   But Corlys loathes himself for what he has done and changes the topic almost attacking her with “Is that why you came? To subject me to an inquisition?”   Rhaenys is shattered when she leaves not necessarily because of Alyn and the confrontation but because she feels like everything she’s held on to so tightly through all the pain and loss is slipping through her fingers. She’s coming undone falling apart. She’s lost so much and she’s feeling like she’s losing her husband her marriage too despite the love they share.   Corlys looks after her with his lost puppy eyes feeling helpless. How can I fix this?  that was my rambling for today. still processing. rest in peace my queen.,2024-07-08 23:32:56 GMT

Now does that mean that I condone his every word and action? No far from that actually. But I’m simply incapable of hating him because it pains me just how much of a product of his upbringing he is.   All he ever wanted literally the one thing he ever wished for was to be loved.   It sounds cheesy? Well it isn’t. It isn’t because he never asked to be born and he never asked to be put on that throne despite everyone making him feel like he should be grateful for it.   It was forced on him and now they’re all finding fault with him for not knowing how to rule.   For not being Viserys.   No one ever taught him. No one ever guided him the way Viserys did with Rhaenyra but somehow Aegon is supposed to know all the answers and if not that then where to and how to seek them.  I can’t help but feel that Aegon’s tragedy is being in his parents’ eyes the living personification of their regrets and mistakes: Viserys never loved him because he got him - the long awaited male firstborn!- after losing the only woman he truly cared about and realizing what his greed made him sacrifice.   By being male Aegon was always gonna threaten the legitimacy of Rhaenyra’s claim and Viserys knew that. Maybe even hated him himself and Alicent for that.   Alicent on the other hand is now unable to look at Aegon without knowing deep down that this is all her fault. That Viserys stayed true to himself until the end and never chose their son. That Rhaenyra is and always was the legitimate heir.   But she cannot doesn’t have the courage to blame herself for it and so she blames Aegon.

I was just enjoying the ladder that chaos is: Aemond underminding his brother’s authority in front of the council cause why not Alicent being unbothered Alys being the original gaslight gatekeep girlboss that she is Matt Smith with an eye patch.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; But when I realised in the black’s council that they were talking about THE Rook’s Rest I just started balling my eyes out. I read the books so I knew that Rhaenys was not gonna make it and she’s one of my favourites on the show. I just cried in front of my screen and when she told Nyra to send her to battle I knew it would be the last time we would see her with the family and I just cried cause to me she’s the true MVP of team black. I had hope that they would make the battle longer so we would have a bit of Eve’s performance in episode 5 but she was incredible in that battle and I will miss her on the show.     Now Aemond.  I just want to see him and Alys in the same room I can’t wait he’s unhinged she’s the baddest bitch to have ever walked the earth it’s gonna be great. I mean we all knew he was a twisted deranged man who needs therapy (like the entirety of team green to be fair (I am in no way shaming people who need therapy I am one of them please take care of your mental health it’s very important)) but bestie that’s treason. And he is so good at it like we knew he was pressed about Aegon being the king and not him but dude. You just kindslayed for the 2nd time do you really need a third? And you’re brother at that like I know he’s a nuisance but still don’t push it my dude.  He’s gonna take a page from Alys’ book next episode and gaslight gatekeep girlboss like he never has in his life. Can’t wait for those 2 to meet.  Burning his brother was an other level of horrid and in true neurodivergent fashion I was covering my ears during the entire dragons dancing situation cause I didn’t want Rhaenys to die.  I think next week is probs gonna be depressing can’t wait 。゜゜(´Ｏ`) ゜゜。,2024-07-09 01:39:44 GMT

There will be a Jace fic dropping tomorrow too! ❤️  &lt;!-- more --&gt; 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐈𝐑𝐎𝐍 𝐓𝐇𝐑𝐎𝐍𝐄 — a seat of power constructed by Aegon the Conqueror in the aftermath of a bloodied war forged from thousands of surrendered swords.   In the days of Aegon the Conqueror it was said that the Throne was sometimes too high to climb a jagged labyrinth of blades melded by dragon’s fire a throne fit for any ruler. Men impaled themselves upon one another’s blades for it turned against one another endless betrayals and treacheries ensued all for the sake of the endgame to see themselves upon the Throne.  Brother turned against brother — you didn’t expect anything less from Aemond whose desire to exact revenge boiled just beneath the surface. The Battle at Rook’s Rest had proved a slaughter on all fronts between the decimation of both Cole’s armies and the castle they laid siege upon to the death of the Princess Rhaenys and her dragon Melys.  Whispers spread through the Red Keep in regards to King Aegon’s condition bones crushed beneath the weight of Sunfyre who plummeted from the skies in a ball of fire. His flesh was scorched half of his body melded to the Valyrian Steel armor he wore burnt beyond recognition.   If they were to be believed King Aegon was gravely wounded — and if a fatality ensued who would then bear the mantle of King?   A restless dusk gripped King’s Landing as the surviving soldiers from Cole’s armies arrived at the city gates King Aegon amongst the wounded. In what you considered to be a mass panic and hysteria Maesters rushed to diligently attend to their King who seemed to be meeting a simmering grave inside of his armor — it would be his tomb if they weren’t careful.  Merely a handmaiden and servant to nobility the antics of your masters didn’t interest you — you were wholly preoccupied with your own survival and self-preservation amongst other things. It was said that Aemond and Vhagar had swarmed the battlefield and come to King Aegon’s defense but by the time they had Aegon had been swallowed by dragonfire.  Part of you had difficulty believing that Aemond truly attempted to save his elder brother given Aemond’s embittered sentiments. Your relationship with the Prince had transcended all bonds of propriety — and if anyone were to find out they would likely have your head for sullying his virtue.   Nevertheless as chaos swarmed around you you knew exactly who to seek out. Queen Alicent had little desire to be hounded by handmaidens while her eldest son struggled to hang onto his own life something you could understand. Instead you made for Aemond’s chambers the route embedded into your mind.  You sought him — all of him. His lilac hue a maelstrom of forlorn emotions and his silvery tresses like cascading silk embedded themselves into your mind. His cunning countenance and beguiled expression were like hot-iron brands cast onto your thoughts tormenting you with each waking moment.  As you stepped closer to the Throne Room no longer guarded by Kingsguard you saw the great door ajar — no King atop the throne. You wondered if he would live Aegon — a drunken broken man who preferred his cups and whores over ruling — or if he would perish.   You knew who would sit the Iron Throne should Aegon fall.  A heavy darkness had befallen the throne room fitting for the many tragedies like the gloom of a shadow haunting all who dared to enter. Curiosity gripped you as you stepped inside a place well above your station yet you wondered if there was anyone inside.   The doors remained shut save for the one you slipped through the gap slim. Flickering braziers provided some illumination to such a grandeur hall but it seemed so dour and lifeless without the presence of the day without subjects fluttering in and out. Instead it provided an ominous sense of dread as if luring those inside with dark omens and false promises.  A familiar crown of silvery tresses stood at the very center before the throne — he didn’t need to turn around for you to know who it was. He seemed entirely unscathed by the battle at Rook’s Rest hands carefully folded behind his back posture poised and dignified.   Aegon’s dagger flashed within his right hand clutched tightly at his side. You wondered how he had acquired the blade so swiftly after a tragedy — but you knew. You had always known of Aemond’s nature of his restrained resentment towards his brother the King of the Seven Kingdoms.   “Aemond.” Your voice reverberated throughout the throne room carrying a fair distance as you closed the door behind you. The studded mahogany groaned in protest yet bent to your will as it closed with a noisy thud. Admittedly you were surprised to see him here and not in the comfort of his chambers.   He didn’t move rigid and still as you quietly approached dresses sweeping across the smooth stone beneath you. His violet hues remained transfixed upon the Iron Throne a throne that would soon be his if fate favored him. So many swords so much strife and conflict that forged such a chair — so much bloodshed.  Aemond often wondered what the weight of the crown would feel like upon his brow — and even then he knew he would wear it better than Aegon ever could. He had stood by the wayside for far too long learned in his studies and a talented swordsman wondering if it would all have some reward some payoff.  Now his opportunity was swiftly approaching.  Whatever anger he’d often kept leashed it had struck out like the bite of a poisonous viper sinking into its prey with all its bitter viciousness. It was the same tempestuous rage that had lashed at Lucerys Velaryon and now it had struck his brother Aegon the Magnanimous.   A stupid sobriquet for a stupid man — a drunken fool. Aemond would simply pass it off as an unfortunate accident with Aegon carelessly stepping into the line of fire whilst tangling with the Queen Who Never Was. Swift decisions had to be made on his part his brother a victim of such action.  Any silver-tongued words that would placate his Mother he was prepared to let them fly. Aemond knew enough to know that the consequences would be slim and those of true action and cruel intentions would take Aegon’s place — men like himself.  Soft footfalls fell across black stone and you called his name again like a siren’s song luring the sailor into deeper waters. “Aemond.” It was saccharine dripping with genuine warmth that the Prince was simply unaccustomed to.  The unexpected lull of your voice broke his fixation and he looked to you with a gaze full of desire. It was a farcry from the frustrated despondent man you’d encountered days prior following the incident at the brothel. There was a newfound fire within his eyes a confidence restored — a sense of triumph.  Admittedly you were rather perplexed by this invigorated side to Aemond — that wild gleam within his lilac eye only seemed to grow in intensity as you approached him. “I heard the news of what happened to your brother” You began pondering his reaction. “You have my deepest sympathies.”  The admiration he had for you only seemed to blossom knowing that you were simply keeping up appearances for his sake. Aemond’s mouth tilted into the ghost of a smirk feigning melancholy despite the truth of his own actions. “It was a horrible thing what happened to the King” He uttered glancing toward the throne. “I wish for his swift recovery.”  A facade was a mere understatement — you could almost taste the smug bemusement that rested within Aemond’s tone. The slight quirk of his mouth the manner in which he spoke — his sympathies for Aegon were nonexistent.   “As any good brother would.” You replied stepping closer until you stood before the Iron Throne gaze falling upon the thousands of swords swarming the seat blades of many shapes and sizes. You wondered about the people behind each sword — who swung it what their lives must’ve been like.   A brief hum escaped Aemond who observed you hawkishly as you approached violet hue greedily drinking you in as he had many times before. You had stood so faithfully by his side never admonished him for the brash actions taken against his family never deemed him pathetic for what happened at the brothel.   He cared little for your station little for your status as a lowborn — if he sat the Iron Throne he could have whatever he wanted. It didn’t matter if you were a commoner Aemond could envision you as his wife a Queen — no longer bowing to the whims of greater men and women who cared little for you.  “Did my Mother dismiss you this evening?” Aemond questioned digits tense around the pommel of Aegon’s knife — now his. Seeing as he was no longer fit to carry the weapon it was only just that it pass to his brother his next of kin.   “She did” A gentle exhale escaped you one that allowed you to maintain your composure. Being in Aemond’s presence seemed to make you dizzy with desire with each passing moment — not a new sentiment but an intoxicating one. “I was coming to find you to see if you were well after the battle.”  Shamelessly Aemond became quite aroused at the thought of you wandering about the Red Keep with the single-minded desire to see him. His blood ran hot after the battle — the surge of adrenaline did not lessen in your presence.   His jaw tensed slightly as he appraised you taking a step closer brazenly closing the distance between you both. He could smell your perfume the warm bouquet of flowers and a touch of honey. “How thoughtful.” His voice dropped to a low purr dripping with the first inklings of lust.   Your breath hitched words turning to ash upon your tongue as your fingers curled into your dress. Aemond enticed you in ways that no man had before — and he saw you a woman beneath the gowns of a servant. The hammering of your heart within your chest had stirred something powerful — your want for him consumed you like a tidal wave.  Before you could utter his name he descended like a starving wolf to kiss you open-mouthed and bleeding lust. You shivered wanting to coax him into returning to his chambers before things became heated. His hand dropped to seize your hip hauling you closer to him until no space was left between your bodies.  You reciprocated his kiss able to hear a faint growl of approval building up within his throat. It was fiery and hot with little concern of who might see you. Aemond was growing emboldened brazen knowing the power he now held within his grasp.   “We should return to your quarters” You whispered a strained whimper tearing past your lips as Aemond kissed your jaw sucking at the flesh of your neck. “Aemond we can’t — not here.” Your breathy pleas fell upon deaf ears — what better place to claim you than before his new throne?   “We can” Aemond murmured pushing your tresses aside as he claimed your throat laying waste to your flesh in his rabid kisses and hungry bites. “The rest of the Keep is preoccupied.” His reassurance was threadbare at best but you were beginning to slip off of the deep end fingers clawing at his tunic.   “What if someone sees?” Fear trickled into your voice a subtle fright that Aemond found to be enticing. You worried for your own skin — he could understand that. A moan escaped you as Aemond nipped at your jugular squeezing at your hips.   You failed to comprehend that he would protect you shield you if needed. He did not need to justify his obsession for you just as Aegon never offered any justification for his nightly whore hunts. Aemond seemed quick to soothe your worry hand clasping at the nape of your neck.  “Then I will have their head” His delectable purr dropped an octave scratching the itch within your head. “You needn’t worry ñuha dōna. I can do whatever I wish.” Aemond assured you a great fire burning within his lilac hue. The leather of his eyepatch concealed the listless sapphire beneath.   He only needed to serve himself — his family cared little for him and the world was often against him. He looked forward to facing Daemon whenever the time came should he be bold enough to challenge him. Aemond dismissed it all — Aegon his mother Criston Cole — the only thing that mattered were the both of you.  Aemond’s streak of possessiveness had grown into something uncontrollable a festering desire to keep you close spiraling into obsession. You were many things to him many things he coveted for himself.   After a moment of hesitation you decided to make things tempting for Aemond loosening the bodice of your dress. His breath hitched the noise subtle if one wasn’t observant enough. He seized the back of your head once more hungrily pressing his lips to yours consuming you in another heated kiss.   A dour portrait of dusk hovers around the Red Keep its shadowy tendrils slinking into the throne room. Only moonlight and dying braziers are your guide and Aemond is at his prettiest whenever he’s touched by the silvery rays. It strikes his narrow visage paints his silky tresses in pale light.  He is closer to a god now than he is a man — fortunately you were willing to return to religion if it meant that Aemond was who you worshiped. As much as you liked to believe it was the foundation of your relationship he thought of it alternatively the roles reversed.  Your digits slip beneath the overcoat he wore marred by speckled dirt and brimstone. His broad sinewy shoulders are concealed by his tunic and he seems vastly overdressed compared to you still wearing your servant’s clothes. Aemond had gotten you a dress to wear with him before — you never wore it otherwise.  There is a certain intensity in the way he kisses you as if each embrace might be your last. In the aftermath of a battle you understand such sentiments given the fate of the King and the Princess Rhaenys.   A growl reverberates within the depths of his throat as he pries his mouth away from you gesturing toward the flight of obsidian steps that ascend toward the Iron Throne. “There” He uttered more of a command than a suggestion. “Lay down.”   A shudder rolls down the length of your spine followed by an onslaught of goosebumps that snake across your flesh like a fever. Your stomach churned with anticipation filling with the sensation of sloshing heat burning brighter as each moment passed.   Without question you step toward the throne noticing the sharpness of some blades the dullness of others. You find your footing upon the last step feeling Aemond stalk closer. The rustling of his belt makes you shiver only to find the steely chill of the Conqueror’s knife pressed against the dip between your shoulder and neck.  Aemond closes in behind you caging you against his chest like a predator swarming hapless prey. His narrow nose brushed along your soft tresses as he dragged the tip of the knife from your shoulder to ribcage. “Shall I cut this from you?” He uttered digging the Valyrian steel into the fabric of your dress.  Swallowing the growing lump within your throat you brace yourself for the bite of the knife for the unruly tear of fabric but it never comes. Instead Aemond’s mouth pressed vigorous kisses against your neck hand seizing you by the throat.   “Ao sytilībagon naejot nyke.” Aemond purred feeling you turn within his grasp. Desire oozed between you both an onslaught of carnality soon to follow. His lilac hue flickered over your countenance drinking in your beauty with unrestrained rapture. You belong to me.   From what little High Valyrian you’d learned in the time you’ve been with Aemond you strung enough of the sentence together to know what he meant. “Iksan aōhon.” A soft whimper emerged from between your parted lips noticing the way his pupil dilated with amorous intent.   I am yours.  A flame of obsession roared within his gaze enough to burn you alive where you stood. Aemond reveled in your submission to him drank in your devotion — a devotion that would prove fruitful should he ascend the throne. The tip of the knife prodded into your sternum and you absentmindedly leaned forward.  Aemond captured your mouth once more laying claim to you — his paramour. There was nothing sweeter than your desperate mewls and reciprocated passion the succor of your mouth the saccharine scent of your perfume.   The both of you descended to the floor icy and stony as it prodded into your back. He knelt between your legs gaze momentarily flickering between the shadow of the Iron Throne and your mesmerized visage. Aemond kissed you again nipping at your lower lip before rucking up your skirts pushing them toward your hips.  With one knee he bullied his way in between your thighs breaths heavier wrought with anticipation as he lowered his mouth to your collarbone. In one smooth tug he loosened your bodice wrestling with the coarse material as he buried his face into your silky skin.   The throes of passion filled the air — short gasps and labored pants accompanied by the constant shuffling of fabric. “Aemond” You moaned watching as he bit the leather of his glove removing the garment in one jerk of his head. Flesh to flesh he moved to drag his digits along your weeping slit. “Aemond.” Urgency crept into your voice strung-out by need.  “Hm” His cajoling hum sent shivers down your spine heat sloshing around within your stomach. Arousal pooled between your thighs nectar sticky and gathering swiftly. “What a delicious gift you’ve given me.” Aemond uttered slender digits continuing to stroke at your cunt his pace agonizingly slow.  Lifting his fingers to his lips he let them rest upon his tongue gathering your juices to taste. A satisfied grunt of approval escaped him one that made you meld into the floor. It was an uncomfortable surface yet any thought of discomfort dissipated the moment Aemond’s lips pressed against the inside of your knee.  Instinctively your hands flew toward his crown of silken tresses digging in with an ironclad hold. Aemond released a low hiss of satisfaction pressing hot kisses along the inside of your thigh. He dipped lower breath fanning across your cunt.  His tongue raked hot embers across your aching core delivering a series of deliberate strokes that were sure to make you squirm. Aemond preferred to savor you consuming every drop of your nectar as if it were the finest of wines.   “Aemond!” Your voice rose above the cacophony of lewd noises ensuing below noisy enough to reverberate throughout the throne room. It worried you the potential of someone finding you with the Prince-Regent between your legs but pleasure began to outweigh logic.   His name felt sweet from your mouth — if Aemond had it his way he would make you say it a thousand times over. The sharp bridge of his nose buried itself into your mound cock twitching within the leather of his breeches.   Another breathy moan left you stomach pooling with a rush of molten heat. It oozed between your legs as your arousal fell upon the Prince’s tongue much to his delight. He did not waste a drop mouth traveling wherever he pleased lapping at every inch of your cunt.  The Iron Throne overshadowed the both of you a jagged mess of swords surrounded by dusk. Slats of moonlight trickled in from the stained glass above falling across his visage violet hue sparkling with lust. His lips greedily kissed at your clit causing your hips to lurch forward.  “Look at me.” A pointed demand spoken from an edged tongue one that commanded your attention without wavering. With a strangled moan you turned your head to him furthering the fire within your belly. Your doe-eyed stare locked onto him lips falling apart.   As your eyes flickered over his poised features your hand tightened within his tresses coaxing him closer toward the apex of your thighs. Aemond wasn’t sly at suppressing the delight he felt in that moment greedily lapping at your cunt.  You watched enthralled by the ministrations of his mouth the flick of his tongue the tantalizing efforts made to draw you back in. His features were carved like marble by the steady hand of a sculptor — godly in the best way possible.   Aemond hoped that your blissful cries would alert the guards — perhaps all could bear witness to his carnal delights know that you belonged to him and him alone. His lips crawled to a sluggish pace made only to torment you as he peppered feather-light kisses against your clit. The lack of pressure nearly made you wretch digits curling into a fist.  Every fiber of your being felt as if it had been set ablaze washed within the fires of his affection. He knew your body well as well as he knew his own tongue dipping to have a taste of your core as it lightly jutted against your entrance. You whimpered the noise pathetic and pitiful yet overwhelmingly eager.  “Please” You moaned breathy and clawing for some shred of release canting your hips forward. Aemond retreated just enough to leave you writing upon the steps before a sly chuckle reverberated between your thighs. His torture of you was playful and intimate intended to make you beg. “Please Aemond!”  How could he deny you when you sounded so sweet?  With a soft hum Aemond returned to devour your cunt drink from the nectar that oozed between your legs. His hands situated themselves against your thighs nails digging in enough to leave behind traces of angered crescent marks.   The heat between your legs intensified arousal stinging your bones body bent underneath Aemond’s will as he lapped at your core. His lips were accompanied by his spindly digits as two fingers prodded at your entrance feeling the crescendo of your whimpers before sinking themselves into your tight cunt.  Squelching intermingled with that of brazen pants and your myriad of moans a cacophony of lust that permeated the throne room. It felt sinful to defile the steps of a seat of power but that shame swiftly contorted into bliss — it felt good.  It felt good to be desired for Aemond to feel not an ounce of regret or remorse for being with you or for the carnage his actions wrought. The darkness that festered within his eye only grew once a flickering shade now growing into something sprawling.   At last his lips pursed around your clit stimulating that sensitive clutch of nerves. Your back arched from the stone thighs rattling like falling leaves as he brought about your ruin. His digits viciously pumped in and out of your cunt preparing you for the act that was to follow.  His tongue lashed across his lower lip not wasting a drop of what sweetness you provided him with. Aemond’s mouth hastily abandoned your cunt yet the curling of his fingers seemed to make up for the loss of pleasure. You felt his wet lips purse around the pebbled peak of your breast suckling like a greedy babe.  Aemond’s senses drowned in desire cock throbbing within his trousers desperate to be inside of you. It wouldn’t be much longer now as he bit and kissed your chest letting the work manifest as love bites evidence of his carnal want for you.   “I need you Aemond. I need you inside of me.” The suddenness of your words left him reeling a snarl stirring within his chest as his teeth gnashed into the soft flesh between your breasts. You longed to feel his cock lay waste to your cunt for him to fuck away his anger his frustration.   Hastily his hand flew to the ties of his breeches loosening the threads of leather. You grabbed the front of his tunic enough to effectively grab his attention as you pulled him in for a hot kiss. Passion bled through and you could taste yourself upon his tongue as it danced with yours.   The warmth of his cockhead prodded against your folds already slick with your cum and his own. It was messy an entanglement born of desire of the will to possess one another — a claim eternal. Aemond’s hand snaked toward your hip the other keeping himself afloat before he snapped forward.  His cock invaded your cunt without any sluggishness to it the deliberation gone entirely. A wild shimmer glistened within his eye a domineering edge that seemed to wrestle with itself. Aemond wanted to submit to you but in the wake of Rook’s Rest adrenaline and a desire for power simply wouldn’t allow it.   As he fucked you like a hound as Aegon had colorfully put it Aemond could see you seated beside him a crown upon your brow Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. A commoner crawled from dirt and from nothing into his arms — into a seat of power that none would dare challenge.  Fantasy consumed him making him mad with lust. He wanted to crawl beneath your flesh reside there hear your heart hammering within your breast. He seemed pleasantly surprised when you claimed his mouth your tongue advancing past his parted lips.  With your skirts having fallen to the swell of your hips you hitched one leg around him hand clawing at his back between his shoulders. “Aemond” You moaned overwhelmed by his barrage of erratic thrusts. His stamina was something to witness as he kept a rather vigorous pace. “My King.”  A low growl stirred within his throat a stark warning not to continue with your current line of thought. Aemond bit at your lower lip prompting you to moan into his mouth but you surprised him again when you reciprocated. Things were intense far more fiery than they ever had been before.   Battle made him hot — such a sensation wasn’t aided by your presence intensified tenfold. With Aegon wasting away inside of his chambers steel melting into his flesh swarmed by flocks of Maesters Aemond felt no remorse — none at all as he fucked you before the Iron Throne.   He felt no remorse when he ordered Vhagar to burn his brother he felt no remorse when he brought you into his bed — and he would feel no remorse when he ascended the throne and made you his Queen.   His cock furiously battered away at your cunt the lewdness of flesh and intermingled breaths being the only sounds that mattered. That lilac hue of his studied your countenance the devotion and rapture that rest upon it your complete and utter joy. Aemond had been blessed with the loveliest creature — you.  The stretch you felt as Aemond invaded your nethers was a pleasant one your walls tight around his length as he continued to fuck you. Face to face chest to chest — there was no room left for deception nowhere left to turn to. With a groan Aemond kissed you yet again.  “Kesan mazverdagon ao ñuha dāria.” I will make you my Queen; he growled into your ear biting at the shell the act enough to make you whimper. He filled your cunt with his cock the only one that it would ever take. In the heat of the moment he bit at your neck hand gripping your thigh so hard that it was bound to leave bruises.   Darkness swallowed the hallowed halls — braziers flickering out completely leaving only moonlight. Even through the silvery haze Aemond’s face remained a picture of living perfection his brow creased with concentration.   The fervor of his pace began to slow cock throbbing with an onslaught of arousal one that flooded his body with waves of bliss. He wasn’t neglectful of your needs swiftly placing a hand between your bodies thumb rubbing circles around your clit.  Heavy footfalls of guardsmen resonated from outside of the sealed doors a nightly patrol prompting you to shiver from worry but Aemond did not stop — and he wouldn’t. His blazing eye bared down upon you glistening with the sheen of lust of obsession a man starved of the love and devotion he so desperately chased.  Your lips felt swollen a byproduct of Aemond’s biting of the many shared kisses that had turned into hunger. You were ravenous for him in ways that you had little knowledge of scraping the surface of what desire truly meant.   Silky pale tresses fell through your digits as you threaded them within his hair gripping it in fistfuls as you continued to kiss him until every wisp of air was stolen from your lungs. Aemond did not relent continuing to adopt a rhythmic pace of fucking you cock halfway out before he thrust forward again and again.  As the both of you approached the precipice falling into a white-hot abyss you could hear him murmuring something in High Valyrian strings of sweet praises and compliments. His thumb continued to circle your clit even after you had your release milking his cock with an onslaught of your nectar.   Aemond grunted forehead nudging against yours as he snapped forward one final time cock sheathed inside of you as he found a warm place to spill his seed. The recklessness of it was of little consequence to him — an herbal tea could remedy it yet the thought of filling you with an heir became tantalizing.  Not yet — not now.  If his seed were to take it would sow discord across his house and there was enough of that already. Aemond huffed gathering his composure as your whimpers dwindled into soft pants. His claws sank so deep into you talons wrenched into your heart your body everything.   He placed a kiss upon your brow a subtle gesture that reminded you of his lingering duality. Aemond pulled himself out of you with an onslaught of stickiness a mess that would only be remedied by a long soak in the bath — something he would need you for.  Your chest felt tight both from exhilaration and the intensity of it all. As you adjusted your skirts back into place Aemond gently coaxed you to your feet pressed close against you as he stared at the throne. “Perhaps once I ascend we will have to make use of the throne.” His salacious purr made you shudder.  “There is no law forbidding us from acting upon that now” You challenged and Aemond had to restrain himself from acting upon such a lascivious impulse. For as coy as you could be you were just as lustful as he was at times a quality that he greatly adored. “Your Grace.”  As much as the teasing title seemed to provoke him Aemond grabbed your hips lips twitching into his familiar smirk a near-permanent expression. “Aemond” He corrected pressing a kiss against your jaw. “For now I will need assistance with drawing a bath.”   The Throne’s harrowing shape cast its shadow as the both of you abandoned the dark halls and into the light of Aemond’s chambers.  copyright @ swordgrace ; please do not attempt to steal or translate my works onto other platforms or claim it as your own.,2024-07-09 02:59:21 GMT

It’s not bad writing for characters to believe they are the only ones who can save the world and hold supremacist beliefs just because we know that to be untrue. We can think it is stupid and just people trying to justify colonizing somewhere (much like the attitude held when the British colonized America and said they were saving the savages) but that does not make it a bad story.   Also the weird trend of people thinking because a show/movie/book/whatever shows something bad it means they condone it?

Im a long-time reader but first-time writer.  Chapter 2 - war council sexy sparring and a confrontation.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Cregan Stark stood at the head of a large wooden table surrounded by advisors and generals. His dog sat obediently beside his chair. The table was spread with maps denoting positions and pathways. Cregan’s fingers traced a potential route his eyes focused.  “This pass” he began pointing to a narrow way in the mountains “Will be our best chance. It’s least expected. We’ll split our forces…”  Before he could continue the door creaked open and you walked in your curious gaze taking in the scene. You curtseyed before the council approaching the table with measured steps. Cregan’s pet waddled over and nuzzled against your dress letting you scratch behind his ear.  Cregan’s brow furrowed. “My lady” he began his tone polite but firm “This is a war council meeting. It’s not a place for a princess.”  There was a murmur of agreement from some of the men and women while others looked away not meeting your gaze.   You swallowed the insult whether he intended it or not hoping your confidence didn’t waver as you offered in turn. “In Sunspear my father’s council valued the insights of all regardless of sex or stature. I’ve studied battles since I was little my lord and strategies. My input might offer a fresh perspective.”  Cregan hesitated raising a brow in trying to assess when their or not this information about Dornish customs was true.  “Your highness.” One of the generals an older man with grizzled hair grunted “There is no harm in hearing the lady Stark my lord. The Dornish have a way with unconventional tactics.”  You held your tongue from telling the general the tactics only seemed unconventional to him but in the south they were quite practiced. You were grateful enough that he spoke in your defense.   After a long pause Cregan finally nodded. “Very well. Speak your mind my lady.”  You smiled at your husband and approached the maps. With a glint in your eye you began outlining your thoughts suggesting alternatives and considering Dornish strategies that the North had made full use of. The room slowly grew quiet listening cautiously to your thoughts. As you spoke you glanced around the room to get a take of the atmosphere. Some members of the council sat with skeptical looks questioning your suggestions others with furrowed brows of concern.   You spotted your husband whose eyes followed the map where you were pointing out battle formations. You didn’t expect his eyes to snap up to meet yours the cloudy storm in them rendering you speechless for a moment.   You stuttered in the midst of your sentence feeling heat rush to your cheeks. You cursed yourself inwardly when you saw the corner of his mouth perk up. He was laughing at you. No matter how you have brought the room to silence Cregan still didn’t take you seriously. The embarrassment and humiliation made you all the more self conscious as you thanked the gods that one of the generals the same one who had stood up for you took in one of your suggestions and began to talk it over with the council.   “If I may my lord.” He began to talk to Cregan whose eyes and condescending smirk were still on you. “The merging of Dornish and Northern tactics might just be the edge we needed.”   Cregan finally tore his watchful eyes away from you and you took in a deep breath. “Tradition had its place for a reason don’t you agree Ser Robert?”  The general nodded albeit giving the lord a knowing look. “Sometimes the winds of change bring unexpected allies and advantages.”   Cregans gaze switched back to you. “Aye sometimes.” His expression unreadable once more.   ———————————————————-  The courtyard buzzed with activity men-at-arms training for the looming battle. At the center Cregan Stark and his kingsguard Ser Jon clad in their sparring breaches and boots moved with a fluid grace each thrust and parry a testament to their combat training. Steel against steel echoed off the ancient stone walls.  Watching from the sides your eyes traveled appreciatively over Cregan’s physique particularly the way you could see every tensed muscle of his arms chest and abdomen as he carried out perfected movements. Beneath your admiration however was a desire to humble him after his dismissal of you in the war council. To make him turn red for once.   Walking forward to the table decorated with weaponry you picked up your favored curved Dornish blade sharp and deadly a gift for Cregan from your court.   You slowly approached the sparring duo. “Care for a challenge my lord?” You were happy your voice didn’t waver.   The knight and lord Stark paused their fight lowering their weapons the courtyard going silent. Cregan tilted his head to meet your gaze a smirk playing on his lips. “You’re not dressed for it my lady. That gown looks too precious to risk-”  Without a word you grabbed the hem of your gown and tore it fashioning a makeshift skirt that allowed for movement. You barely felt the cold air as the adrenaline rushing through your veins brought a familiar heat. The gathered crowd murmured around you.  Cregan caught himself staring at you but recovered quickly chuckling. “Spoiled princess tearing such fine fabric.”  You exhaled sharply at the comment feeling again as if you were a misbehaving child being disciplined. You were going to enjoy this. “My lord” You put up your blade and held your stance.   “Alright” Cregan held up his sword and got in position. “If you are so eager to prove a point.”  You advanced your blade zooming in the air. The courtyard crowd drew back. The initial clash was swift Cregan clearly taken aback by surprise. You ducked under his strikes retaliating with speed. A well-timed move saw Cregan on the ground the wind knocked out of him. He only stayed that way for a moment though quickly getting back up.  “I am every bit the warrior you are” you insisted with conviction as the two of you circled one another.  Cregan recovered quickly. With newfound respect he launched a fierce counterattack which you blocked.   Of course Lord Stark knew nothing of the discipline Sunspear princesses have received including battle strategy and combat. You were glad you at least got to see the surprise in his features when you dodged his attacks masterfully. Your old teacher back home would be proud.   Blades blurred in the air as you fought. But Cregan’s strength and experience began to tell. With a deft move he had you pinned against the hey covered ground his hand reaching around your back to put a buffer between you and the ground.  He inched towards you until you were a breath apart making you breath hitch. “Being a good sparring partner doesn’t make you a good warrior princess” he breathed.   Your cheeks burned but you were determined to get away victorious. With a sudden twist you broke free using your legs to flip him onto the ground as you rolled on top of him. Cregan found himself on his back your curved blade cool against his throat. He looked up not just into the eyes of a skilled fighter but a woman who had quite literally kicked his ass even if it was by fighting dirty.   You looked down at him but something made you pause. His wolfish grin was back. His eyes wandered slightly noting the way your dress had ridden up scandalously you realized revealing your legs. You tried to ignore the feeling that look of his stirred within the pit of your stomach.  “Don’t underestimate your opponent” you breathed fighting a smile. You missed the rush of fighting. Feeling brazen you leaned in closer until you were sure only he could hear. “You rely too heavily on might. Long-range combat is key to reducing casualties. Thank you for granting me the honor of sparring with you.”  With that you rose gracefully leaving a dazed Cregan on the floor.  ———————————————————-  The flicker of candlelight lit up your bedchamber in a warm glow. On the table maps were sprawled out in detail. Concentration etched your features as you calculated troop movements supply routes and attacks.  The door creaked open revealing Cregan Stark his eyes heavy and ready for sleep after his wash his hair tied messily behind his ears and falling lazily over his forehead. “I must accompany Ser Robert tomorrow to the front.” He said.  “Look” You pointed to your notes. “This regiment right here.”  He glanced over brows furrowed. “That’s too many men” he said his tone sharp. “I won’t needlessly risk Northern lives.”  You met his gaze evenly. “Victory requires the right numbers. And this is the number we need.”  “The numbers ‘we’ need” he shot back echoing your words. “These are people you are sending to their deaths. Offering up thousands of Northern lives like its nothing.”  “No!” You stood your ground chin raised defiantly though your lower lip began to tremble. &quot;It’s almost as though you have forgotten that I am your wife Cregan Starl! These people your people are mine now too. I value them as much as you do!”  His grey eyes stormed at your words clearly not expecting you to be so blunt with him.   You stepped closeryour voice finding its confidence. “From the moment I’ve arrived here. You… you’ve treated me with nothing but disdain! Dismissing my opinions underestimating me and ridiculing me in front of your men. The only respect you showed was when we sparred. Is that the only language you understand?”  His icy facade wavered guilt flickering in his eyes. “y/n” he began.   But you weren’t having any of it. “Please just listen!“  While you still had his attention you launched into your strategy outlining troop movements and battle formations and emphasising the importance of long-range weapons.   “The longbow may work in the windless desserts” he interrupted. “But the climate here is different.”  “We make use of trebuchets then.” You insisted.   He blinked at that. “Perhaps”   As the two of you spoke exchanging ideas back and forth the plan became clear. Cregan for the first time truly listened no belittling smirks or jibes.  “With this plan more lives could be spared. Our men can come home.” You finished with nothing more to add.   You looked at him for either approval or dissatisfaction. Anything to give you a sign of what he thought. But his face was unreadable as he leaned on the desk studying your combined notes. His mouth remained in a hard line but his eyes plagued by grey storms were on you.   “Cregan?” You asked urging him to share his thoughts.   Cregan took a step towards you closing the distance between you two his hand lifting your chin up and capturing your lips in a fierce kiss.   You gasped your limbs temporarily going numb with sudden warmth as his soft lips moved roughly against yours. This man didn’t kiss gently. He was roughened up by his environment and did not hold back. Just as he handn’t on his wedding night. Only now it was different. Now he seemed like he actually wanted to be kissing you.   Your hands grasped at his wide shoulder to balance yourself. “Cregan…”  Your initial surprise melted after a moment giving way to desire and you responded with equal interest kissing him back. His hands found your hips and pulled you sharply against himself tightening around you. You felt hard muscle. The man was all rough edges and cold demeanors but right now he was warm. This was the passion you’d yearned for the connection you’d dreamt of.  Outside of the boarded window you overheard the sounds of the night the whistling win the sound of owls hooting and echoes of a wolf howling from a distance. Suddenly Cregan pulled away abruptly leaving you breathless and disoriented.  “Y/N” he began breathing unevenly. “I cannot…”  “What?” Your voice broke dreading the rejection you knew was coming.  “You regret our union dont you.” You said finally tired of waiting for his response.  He looked up at you with furrowed brows. “That is not what I-  You shook your head eyes on the floor as you tried to calm your racing breaths. “Its alright.” You reassured him hoping it would make it easier to be truthful with you. “You hate that I’m not a Northerner. That I’m not your equal.”   You watched as his handsome features hardened into anger. As if you had just said something extremely stupid.   He took two steps and backed you against the wall. Gasping you blinked up to meet stormy grey eyes staring down at you.   &quot;My land is in crisis” he finally said his voice raw. “I can’t afford to be distracted by such… dramatics. If you wished for constant passion and fire in your marriage I’m afraid you ran out of luck with me princess.”  Before he could say more and having heard enough you gathered the maps on the table and shoved them into his hands before storming out of your bedroom door leaving him alone in the candlelit room your ego bruised and your emotions in turmoil.,2024-07-09 03:45:41 GMT

Note: Rhaenys you Queen.    “I fear this plan will not succeed” Addam said hesitantly. You had not yet had the opportunity to bond with him yet the boy had grown fond of you. Having lost his older brother he now saw you as a role model and you found solace in the few moments you shared reminiscent of your dear Laenor.  Rhaenyra appeared hesitant as well though you endeavored to adhere to her strategy as closely as possible. Having her close and away from the tensions at the castle brought you relief especially given the intense animosity between her and the dowager queen. Your feelings towards Alicent were conflicted; you loved her but since the arrival of the silver-haired your emotions had been in turmoil. You wondered why you had remained on the wrong side for so long—not due to a lack of care for Alicent or Helaena but because you had always known Rhaenyra was being denied what was rightfully hers.  “Y/N” the queen spoke. They stood by the dock awaiting Vhagar’s arrival. Aemond was impulsive but seeing you there with Rhaenyra tempered his rashness. Though he suspected a trap your presence allowed him to approach.  Perhaps he sought absolution.  The enormous dragon arrived accompanied by the prince. Rhaenyra’s expression was a mix of urgency pain and lingering anger yet she maintained a calm controlled demeanor.  “Sister” Aemond greeted briefly looking at you with Addam standing a few meters away. “My lady.”  “Your mother has been asking about you” you said indifferently. He smiled slightly as he often did.  “I don’t know if I am her greatest concern now or if it’s still my brother. I don’t believe this is an ambush; Vhagar and I have scouted the area. What are you seeking?”  “Fetch Aegon” the queen answered without hesitation.  “I have no idea where he is.”  “Find him.”  “I don’t take orders from you. You are not my queen.”  “The city belongs to Rhaenyra Aemond. Your closest allies are dead. Otto Cole and others have gone into hiding knowing the fate that awaits them. Your younger brother Daeron is adamant into fighting. He would out of duty but I don’t want him to suffer the fate of so many others. It’s time to reach an agreement—that’s why we are here now even after everything.” You concluded.  “How much longer will they tolerate the false queen?” he asked but his eyebrows suggested a hidden sentiment still being uninterested.  “You killed my son.”  Aemond’s demeanor suddenly crumbled his eyes freezing.  “I didn’t mean to do it.” He looked back at the ground for a fleeting second.  “Find your brother and make him see reason. Your mother and Helaena are safe in King’s Landing. They will return to Oldtown.”  “And we will be put to the sword won’t we?” he asked incredulously.  “You will go to the Wall” she said.  “I’m not proud of what I’ve done of what I took from you. Nothing will change that now; these are the choices we made. The throne is not yours; you are keeping it warm for the true king.“  &quot;And that’s what you want to be isn’t it?” Rhaenyra stated rather than questioned.  “I don’t know what will become of my brother; he was gravely injured the last time I saw him. I don’t wish for him to be dead. But if the gods have so decided my father had a second legitimate son.”  You were not surprised by Aemond’s ambition for the throne; it had always been latent. Now more than ever it could manifest; he remained the greatest threat to the kingdom though even with his formidable dragon he was no match for all the dragons at the Queen’s disposal.  “Consider it Aemond; this may be the last time. It is the last time” you urged trying to reach him to no avail. He let out an arrogant snort and walked away.  He was broken angry and aimless. There was nothing more you could do neither Rhaenyra nor anyone.  Or was it?  When Aemond turned away and vanished from sight you hastened to your own dragon. Silverwing awaited as did Seasmoke and Syrax though they stood a bit farther from yours. Swiftly you mounted the silver beast and ascended into the sky. Vhagar was still visible making its way to the other side of the hill. Due to its immense size it was hard to lose view of it so you urged Silverwing to pursue at a brisk pace.  Truth be told this was not part of your plans nor those of the queen. Yet upon seeing him once more a surge of desolation and deep-seated rancor overcame you compelling you to attack. First for your nephew Lucerys and for your late mother Rhaenys who had not long ago faced such a beast.  You had buried the memory the vivid recollection of Vhagar cornering Meleys of its enormous razor-sharp teeth sinking into the neck of the Red Queen.  The images flashed back into your mind instantly a harrowing vision of blood and your helplessness to intervene or change the dreadful outcome.  Unable to contain the hatred and impotence that had festered within you you pursued the one-eyed prince.  “Dracarys.” You commanded in a single resolute breath. Aemond did not see it coming; by the time he did the fire had already erupted from your dragon’s maw scorching part of Vhagar’s tail who quickly wheeled around to face you.  In Aemond’s gaze there was surprise and a clear frown of rage. Had it been a trap all along?  No this was not premeditated. This was personal. He knew better than to try reducing you to ashes or to launch a fierce counterattack though perhaps that was what he should have done.  It would not be an easy task as Silverwing though not matching Vhagar in size was still a giant and seasoned dragon unafraid even of the oldest and fiercest dragon.  Aemond growled trying to evade the slashes Silverwing hurled but a dragon disobeys its rider’s commands does it not? Vhagar enraged by the claws digging into its abdomen let out a shrill scream and struck Silverwing hard forcing it to retreat considerably. You held tight to the reins and lunged at him once more.  You wanted to end the prince’s life then and there nothing else mattered but finishing off the one who had taken two loved ones from you. He had to pay; it was time.  Aemond managed to urge Vhagar onward and when you were about to utter another Dracarys another dragon emerged from the tall trees. At first neither of you recognized who it was in the heat of the moment until you realized it was Addam.  Relief washed over you that it wasn’t Rhaenyra coming to your aid as you had rushed off so quickly earlier that you hadn’t even heard her.  However you worried for young Addam; your rash course of action had led him to assist you and when Seasmoke breathed fire something ignited within the ancient dragon making it lose all control that Aemond held over it and Aemond himself decided to counterattack with his own fury and disdain.  In a blink Vhagar tore off Seasmoke’s left wing. You lunging at Vhagar’s exposed neck managed to make it bleed profusely. Fire rained upon you and you shielded yourself dodging. You saw Seasmoke plummet. Vhagar charged but you were faster. Silverwing’s claws sank into Vhagar’s earlier wound causing great damage.  No longer determined to finish the matter then and there you headed to where Seasmoke had descended just as Syrax made its appearance trying to provide aid. Vhagar and its rider fled the scene trailing thick blood in their wake.  Both of you dismounted your respective dragons and arrived where Seasmoke lay groaning in agony clearly missing a limb. It had weakened so much from the injury that it quickly lost its life. Addam miraculously and incredibly did not perish from the impact; he was unconscious but breathing with noticeable fractures yet not in mortal danger. You thanked the Gods for sparing him but your heart shattered upon realizing that because of you Seasmoke had met its tragic end though protecting its rider with whom it had not spent much time yet still cared for until the end.  Rhaenyra was beyond furious with you and justifiably so. Not only had you disobeyed but you had cost her a dragon for her cause and nearly an important ally.  Above all that you had the audacity to risk your own life which was inconceivable to her. She could not believe your poor judgment and rash foolish decision. Although it was what she wished to do upon learning of her son and cousin’s deaths this was not in her plans at all.  “WHAT IN THE SEVEN HELLS WERE YOU THINKING Y/N?!”  Upon returning to the capital she scolded you with a thunderous voice.  Her council was furious with you; Corlys did not know how to approach you anymore. After your mother’s death a chasm had opened between you vast and insurmountable and his attempts to speak with you had ceased completely.  The Queen Dowager no longer spoke to you either hurt by your abrupt change of allegiance your lack of communication and your choices which she had always contested. She did not bother to seek you out nor you her. She clearly learned of your attempt and that’s when she finally understood that your loyalty to her cause had definitively ended.  Desperation and disappointment gnawed at you; you no longer knew how to find yourself again how not to drive away all those you once loved and still loved.  “I lost contro Your Gracel.” You admitted without preamble.  “I care little for what my half-brother thinks but those were not my instructions. You acted beyond my orders.”  “It was an impulse.”  “You have no idea the fear I felt seeing you battling Vhagar. My soul left my body.” The Queen touched her temple frustrated and after a few prolonged seconds she approached you with a more open demeanor.  “I was thinking of my mother. Of Luke.” You confessed honestly to which she let out a heart-wrenching but silent sound as you knew how much the past weighed on her still.  “They should be here today. Alive breathing. Jacaerys…” Your voice broke entirely at bringing them back with your mention. Rhaenyra could not help but start shedding bitter tears. You embraced her or perhaps she embraced you; it mattered little as you immersed in each other’s arms.  “Don’t ever do something so reckless again. Promise me.” Rhaenyra pleaded but you could not make promises you would not keep. “Now that Aemond believes it was all a plot he might to return here. I do not know what to expect.”  “Honestly Your Grace I doubt it. He will probably head to Harrenhal once and for all. Now that the castle has been abandoned by Daemon.”  “Not truly abandoned. The Tullys and Blackwoods are settled there. And their other bannermen. Daemon has also returned there to handle that matter precisely to prevent Aemond from seeking him in battle.” She confessed.  “Is that good for you?”  “My lord husband is accompanied by the rider of Sheepstealer. They had direct orders from me; I previously tasked him with returning and preventing any trouble that Aemond might bring. My last attempt for a somewhat belated and futile peace but it had to be made.” She finished saying.  “We know his nature. They could soon meet their end both of them.”  “There are high probabilities yes.”  ———————–  Once again the same dream once again the same black fire invading your vision.  What kind of cruel pattern was this?  Weeks had elapsed since that fateful encounter with Aemond and the news from Daemon was scarce and unreliable. You knew he and Nettles a brown-skinned girl you had never met were lying in wait for the prince tempting him to emerge from his current hideaway.  Still there was no news from Aegon nor the clubfoot you so despised. The queen ruled over a divided and fragile populace uncertain whether to support her reign or oust her. Many believed she could bring peace and prosperity once this turmoil ended.  That vision… where you were paralyzed immobile.  You began to hear a whispering voice “They will come for them.”  A woman appeared before you someone you had never seen in your life her pale skin and black hair like a raven’s.  Finally you managed to react. Was this truly a dream?  “Get out of my head” you demanded with impetuousness. The woman approached you closer.  “The decision lies with you but you cannot save both.”  And suddenly you shifted to another plane; it was Dragonstone by the seashore.  A young Rhaenyra appeared before you dressed in red and black. She gazed at you sweetly without malice in her eyes. You swallowed hard registering her presence.  This couldn’t be real that witch.  “Nyke’m isse jorrāelagon rūsīr ao (I’m in love with you.) Even if for some bizarre reason my father decided to make me his pronounced heir I would give it up. I’d give everything up to be with you. In a heartbeat. Sagon rūsīr issa (be with me).”  Those words endured through the years. The first part had become reality but what of everything that had happened since then?  The young Rhaenyra gently caressed your cheek her thumb gliding over your earlobe and lips.  In an instant you were in another plane again now in front of a young Alicent who radiated hope and joy in an emerald green dress in that meadow on the way to Oldtown.  “These ones are called Meadow Daisies.”  “Woolly blue violets.”  “And last but not least wild poppies! Do you still think my books are dull?”  The memory of Alicent telling you about each type of flower in the area always stayed with you and recalling it filled you with nostalgia and peace. And what of everything that had transpired since then?  She entwined her delicate hands with yours feeling the tender warmth they emanated.  One of the last planes you ended up in was a remote place that felt quite unfamiliar.  “Your father was born here” the woman making herself noticed again clarified. You felt tension running through your muscles curiosity too and extreme confusion. It was Myr in Essos.  “My father?”  A young man came to the picture; he couldn’t see you. It was just an illusion after all; she was playing with your mind.  Now she took you to the shores of Driftmark where you watched him disembark from his small boat which he proudly handled to meet a tall and charming lady with silver hair.  “You must give birth to my child; they deserve to see all the wonders this world has to offer” he said buoyant his noble heart evident from afar.  The silver-haired girl looked at him tenderly while he gently held her belly.  “Y/N was the name of my dear sister. She always wished to have a daughter and after her passing I promised that mine if granted one would be named after her” he said with melancholy.  “You are in great danger by continuing to return here and you are aware of it Dustan. I do not wish anything ill befalling you” admitted the maiden.  Dustan looked at her deeply and you heard him murmur “You and our unborn baby are worth any risk. Because even if I can’t raise her myself I will love her eternally.”  “You cannot save them both.”  And the black fire consumed you once more.  Your eyes filled with tears and you awoke from the painful and incredible journey you didn’t comprehend whatsoever.

Sibling angst can be so gut wrenching and we know the writers know this because they gave the twin guards a very decent angsty development with like three lines of dialogue and one fight scene.   But the potential was totally wasted with Aegon and Aemond. The brothel scene should have been Aegon laughing at Aemond in a cynical manner and going full “Viserys learns that Daemon went to a pleasure house to celebrate the death of his son” humilliating him not because of some random prostitute but because Aegon is hurt that his “closest blood” was not there for him or Helaena after the death of their child.   Then the council-high-valyrian-argument should have been about Aemond going behind Aegon’s back plotting attacks without his authority because he feels the need to redeem himself for bringing tragedy upon his family.   It could still be “bully Aegon” and “I’m-better-than-you-Aemond” on the surface but with more complex and nuanced reasons for behaving that way.   Aemond being the only one who knows that he was the real target and not Jaehaerys was the perfect setup for him avoiding Aegon and his authority as king because of course he’s being rash and hostil towards his brother! He feels guilty and doesn’t know how to cope! He’s holding on to the idea that he’s better than Aegon but the guilt is eating him inside!   But no.

He could not take his eyes off you you must have been able to feel his eyes on you as you crane your head and lock eyes with him. your expression does not change but you do drop your head and cup your hands together in front of you when his gaze does not stray. a smile tugs at his lips he cannot fight for the first time in days.  once it is all said and done he gets stuck in a conversation with some random knight that he is less than happy to be talking to he finally manages to worm his way out of the conversation and looks around the field for you. his face twitches slighty when he sees you talking with criston cole and hastily rushes over.  Your conversation becomes clearer and clearer the closer he gets. “as i have told you before ser cole i am unmarried.” “i find that hard to believe you are the daughter of lord vance.” you merely shrug at him “i do not know what you wish me to say prior to your arrival i had been the youngest of six i had four other sister ahead of me who married.my father saw no reason to marry me off. he had a son who married a nice lady and now they have all slit their throats in the castle halls i never expected to be in charge or be married.” He had seen the incident first hand when criston burst open the doors of the castle he did not expect to step in a pool of blood and fresh corpses laying on the ground of the majority of house vance excluding you and your father who was just beheaded for not bending the knee.  when you notice gwanye walk over your eyes trail to him for a moment which causes cole to look at gwayne before you turn away from him. “now is certainly not the time to be flirting with ladies cole” cole sighs and he turns to gwayne with his arms crossed “as everyone else in her line is dead and she has no other living relatives she is the new lady of the house. i thought women of your respectable age would atleast have a suitor or two” gwayne rolls his eyes he cannot believe cole and his disrespectfulness if his suspensions were correct he had no clue what his sister saw in him. does he not realize he is speaking to one of the more gorgeous women in the realm?  “and i thought you white cloaks were swore to purity. it seems we are both wrong.” he watches a switch flip in coles eyes and before he can say anything cole has you by the neck and you attempt to take some gasps of air. “cole! release her!” many eyes had turned in their direction as you beat your hand on his forearm but no one dared move. gwanye finds himself pulling out his sword but doesn’t point it at cole just yet but his hand is itching to strike him down.  “you have no clue what you speak of.” cristons spits at you with venom but continue attempting to takes gasps of air. “criston that is enough!” your face contorts in confusion as you continue to try and pull yourself from his grip. “i meant was some of your men were seen in a brothel a town over last night.” Criston keeps you in his hands for awhile longer before he lets you go and takes a step back. you grasp at your neck as you take many deep breaths gwayne puts his sword back and grabs his water skin and hands it to you. He watches as you eagerly drink the sack dry before turning to criston “do you have no decency? strangling an innocent woman?”  cole says nothing but gwayne can tell he’s embarassed about the display and all the eyes on him. criston steps towards you and you step back into gwaynes chest to which he happily keeps you against him as cole speaks hushedly. “you will tell me the names of these men.” you look around at the white cloaks and point to a group of four of them standing around and chatting pretending like you cant feel gwaynes fingers rubbing circles around your hips. “how would i know you are telling the truth?” “my brother was a frequent customer of that particular brothel i had gone to go pick him up and i walked in to see them sharing a particular women in the center of the room with their cocks about but still wearing their armor.”  as much as he hates to admit it cole finds himself believing you “we will discuss this after i am done speaking with them. then we must head out.” gwayne would rather die than go back on the road now especially with you in his hands. “cole can we not take one night to rest? look at the men and tell me they are not exhausted? think of the morale cole.” he does not care about the teams morale but criston doesn’t need to know that yet when he looks around it is rather obvious the team is suffering. mens feet dragging about the ground and faces devoid of life. criston turns to gwayne who simply raises his eyebrows at him criston turns to you “your lands shall host our men for tonight. but just tonight we leave first daylight.” gwayne grins at cristons pointed addition and feels you nod your head. “we have a couple beds though not many-” “we have tents to sleep outside.” “i will be more than happy to take a bed if he will not my lady.”  criston walks off leaving the two of you standing together when you remove yourself from him and turn to face him. “i am not a whore ser hightower.” he flinches slightly in surprise and manages to shake himself out of shock with a laugh. “i never thought you were my lady.” “your eyes and hands certainly say different ser.” He had been a little forward had he? so he bow his head to you.  “apologies my lady let me try this again. I am gwayne hightower pleasure to meet you.” he grabs your hand and brings it up to his lips placing a soft kiss against the back of your hand. you hum and pull your hand away from him much to his annoyance. “likewise i suppose though i wish it was under better circumstances.” he watches as your eyes drift to the large pile of bodies that had built up hes sure your family lies within the pile “i would like to give you my condolences.” you snort and shake your head. “im sure you would.” he wishes he could get a read on you but you keep your walls kept up tight.  he wants to rip them down and expose you to him fully. hes never been so taken with a woman and especially with such quickness maybe it was a fleeting lust but he was so fascinated by you he cant help but want to keep talking with you watch your every move. yet you do not give him the chance as you begin to step away from him “one of my men will show you and your men to your room. Good day ser hightower.”  you turn your back to him and begin to walk away. he almost wants to follow after you to chase you down and continue to talk to you but the way you turn your head back at him to give him one final look is enough to have him knowing itll be worth the chase a smirk is unable to leave his face as he steps away and turns is back to go find cole who happens to be screaming at the men you pointed at. He’ll look for you later he’s sure of it and he’s more than sure he’ll find you.  the sun had been long set and the night cold when he sees you again. its not hard to find your room which had been moved to the main chambers only hours after your fathers death. he finally feels refreshed after a long bath and finally out of his armor or camp clothes being given some soft nigh clothes by the maids. he should just want to lay in bed and sleep maybe even travel with some of the other men to the brothel nearby but he doesn’t much to the surprise of his men. He instead finds himself walking through the empty halls of the castle until he stands in front of the doors of what appears to be your chambers  He knocks before he even can think about his actions and the door cracks open after a few moments of silence. Your head pops out and your eyes narrow at him “do you need something?” “merely wish for some company someone to chat with.” your brow raises and he can tell you do not believe a word he says. “just to chat?” a small laugh escapes him and he smiles “well if you are offering more who i am to deny?” you roll your eyes and the door cranes open some more but you don’t let him in standing in the doorway you lean against the wall. “my maidenhead remains in tact ser.” he throbs you were a minx put on this plane for testing his strength. “don’t make the offer more tempting my lady i am a merely a gentleman.”  he takes the opportunity to get a full look at you changed out of your day clothes and dawned in a silk nightgown in a light green the straps are thin leaving your shoulders and collarbones bare as well as your sleeves but what it lacks up top it is long enough to hit almost your feet. Your arms crossed under your chest where almost salivates at the sight. He can see your nipples poking through the almost sheer fabric of your dress. You are so much better than any sight at any brothel and more beautiful than any eligible lady in all the seven kingdoms.  “you done looking at me yet?” his eyes shoot back up to you while he grins “never my lady.” he watches you face flash and you stand up straight. “as fun as this back and forth is ser hightower unless you are looking to marry me i must ask you to leave.” you bow your head and go to clothes your door but his foot in the way stops you. “ser” “what if i was interested in marrying you?” you push the door open and stare at him blankly. “do not jest ser hightower.” “gwayne please and no i do not jest.” he has never been interested in marrying much his sister had married the fucking king and had plenty children his father cared not for if he was married or not. Gwayne enjoyed the life he lived traveling from brothel to brothel without a care in the world but you had been the first eligible lady hes ever met that even remotely interested him.  it would not be so bad to marry this war has shown him that everything peaceful lasted forever and maybe it would be good to settle down somewhere with someone. he watches you watch him thoughtfully your eyes unreadable as you watch him for any signs of deceit and lies. When he makes no moves you take a couple steps back the doorway to your room now wide open for him to step into. “If you step past the doorway you will have to marry me ser gwayne are you really willing to give everything up for one lay?”  you stare at him with a challenge in your eyes. you think he’ll walk away and you’ll never see him again he’ll be nothing more than a fleeting memory of a handsome man that wanted your attention for a day and you’ll settle for whatever carefully chosen lord the greens pick for you to keep you in line and you’ll live the rest of your life plainly.  The door shuts with a quiet thud and you turn around to take a sip out of your wine glass as silence fills the room you stand in.  a hand suddenly plays with one of the thin straps of your dress and pushes it down your shoulder the right side of your dress falls down exposing the right side of your chest as his lips dance around your shoulder and neck. you lean your head back against his chest as his hands knead at your sides. He begins sucking at the part where your neck and shoulder meet while your left strap falls exposing your chest fully but his stands stop it from fully hitting the floor.  He suddenly spins your around as you take another sip from your wine and he shoves his lips against yours drinking the wine from your lips and some dribbles out of your mouth. when he removes his lips they trail down and lick up all the wine that had slipped out his hands leave your waist and your dress hits the floor softly leaving you bare in front of him.  his head spins as he stares at you you sit on the table with your legs parted. “live up to your standards?” he shakes his head as he drops to his knees “your beauty surpasses that of the maiden herself.” He rubs his hands on your thighs as you let out a shaky breath staring at his ginger hair. he presses light kisses on your inner thighs growing closer to where your dripping for him.  he licks softly at your folds first before his tongue pushes past them and greedily lapping at your core. his hands grab at your hips to pull you closer to him as you rut your hips again his face. When he groans against your core shedding shivers up your spine your throw your head back is your hand tugs at his hair softly.  you bite your lips to silence yourself in the hopes no one hears you but when he pulls away and bites your thigh you can’t but let out a whine. “let me hear you.” you shake your head as he pushes two fingers inside of you “what if someone hears?” “let them hear us i dont care.”  Your grip on his hair grows tighter as you feel his lips wrap around your clit and his fingers begin to push in and out of you at a steady pace. you hunch over as you grow closer and closer he revels in the way you’ve stopped holding yourself back and lets your sounds flood his ears. he can tell you’re close with the way your grip on his hair tightens even more and the way your thighs clench so snuggly around his head.  “gwayne.” he pulls away just enough to speak to you “its okay let go.” he licks up every drop you spend out while his fingers help guide you through your peak. he stands back up and smiles at you with his bruised glossy lips. “do you want me to do the same?” he licks his lips and shakes his head “not today beautiful as tempting as that is.” he presses his lips against yours as his hands work as his trousers to free himself. your hands join his and make quick works to free himself from his clothes leaving him bare. he picks you up and you giggle as he smiles against your lips and drops you onto the bed.  you grip his shoulders tightly as he begins to thrust into you. mumbling words of encouragement in your ear you hiss as he enters you more and more until he’s fully inside of you. he tries his best to restrain himself knowing you need time to adjust he feels the way your walls clench around him and the way your eyes shut tightly he cant help but groan at the sensation of it all. fuck whores and fuck brothels he thought nothing would truly get better than this. and when he starts to thrust and the way you sing to him is better than any wine.  he helps your legs wrap around him as his thrust grow more and more aggressive as he watches your tits bounce he cant help but lean down and wrap his mouth around your nipple as he cries out. one of his had been on your thigh moves to rub your clit and only when you release around him does he allow himself to spend his seed inside you.  when you fall asleep on his chest as he traces shape in your skin a playful smile falls on his lips as he thinks about how furious cole will be the man had been planning to marry you off to some old man who would agree to anything they said and now cole is going to be stuck dealing with him. yet he doesn’t care because as long as he can have you it doesn’t matter.,2024-07-09 04:52:17 GMT

Like? No? Daemon’s going full King Lear this season with his guilt eating him alive and his mind killing him. He dreams of himself as Aemond because Aemond is the second son just like he was. Daemon believes just like Aemond that he would’ve been a better king if it hadn’t been for his place in birth. This is what I love about media that centers on royalty: birth matters more than anything. That’s how we get conflicts like Romeo and Juliet dying for love despite their kingdoms forcing their heritage on them how we get Hamlet going insane for a crown that was supposed to be his and how the entire plot of House of the Dragon is centered on Rhaenyra versus Aegon. If only Daemon was the first born son. If only Viserys had chosen him instead of his daughter.,2024-07-09 04:18:51 GMT

But now they’re suddenly understanding and sympathetic (??!!) when Aemond lashed out at Aegon. Even though nothing Aegon did could ever compare to the life-long trauma that Aemond suffered because of Luke Rhaenyra and Viserys.

That all Alicent had to do to greatly damage the blacks was call for her guards when she saw her.  That Daemon is off fighting his inner demons without sending ravens knowing how much that could affect Rhaenyra’s planning for war.   That Aemond deliberately let Sunfyre one of only three dragons get badly hurt and then burned.   And we are supposed to think Aegon is the laughing stock?   Don’t get me wrong I love the levels of misery his character can achieve but they frame all his decisions as beyond stupid (which they are to be fair) while Rhaenyra gets an “epic” voiceover about the song of ice and fire that is a clearly attempt to absolve her of all her stupid decisions in the eyes of the audience?,2024-07-09 05:16:59 GMT

The affection that she felt for her mother was strong while her father had never been there acting as if Ysilla was not even his. But she was. The dragon egg that had been put in her cradle hatched. An outcast of a dragon was born. A dragon with no legs. An outcast of a dragon for and an outcast of a dragon rider. Ysilla’s hair was dark but streaked with white. She was a Targaryen and her wrath was not different from the one that burned inside the members of the House of the Dragon.  《 Previous - Next 》  CHAPTER 9  Ysilla was walking up the stairs of one of the many secret passages of the Red Keep. Ysilla had explored the castle with her cousins since they were all just babes and they used them frequently to move around unnoticed.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Ysilla liked to do it. Those dark and lonely places led to different parts of the castle. Every time she walked through those corridors she felt like an adventure. She knew it was childish but she enjoyed it.   But those were even the fastest ways to move in the castle with no people watching or asking where she was going. She liked life at court but people could be very inquisitive and curious. And she didn’t want to show people the anger she was feeling. Aegon really knew how to be cruel when he wanted to be and Aemond seemed to be the target of his jests and the Velaryon brothers even if they were younger. Aemond felt left out from all of them he was different. He would always following them to the Dragonpit even if he lacked a dragon wishing for his egg to finally hatch or for a new dragon to be found.   What is a Targaryen without a dragon? Ysilla was not stranger to that thought. She still remembered how she cradled Darysir’s egg when she was just a babe of five knowing that a dragon was the true legacy of a Targaryen. That was their sigil and symbol of power. No one but them could bound such terrible beasts to their will no one was as strong. And yet a Targaryen without a dragon was just a human. No different from anyone else. That was a frightening thought a saddened one too and she felt for Aemond since he had to indulge in such pain.  “Are you alright?” She had asked him following him to make sure he didn’t felt alone. She knew how loneliness hurt to the heart and the spirit.  His posture was stiff. Ysilla could not see his face but she didn’t miss how he quickly pass a hand over his dirty face “Yes cousin.”  The girl looked down at her hands she was picking at her nails sometimes she did that when she felt uncomfortable. Out of words. Those situations were the hardest to handle since she felt like her every word could make no difference.  “I’m sure you’ll have a dragon one day my prince” she whispered not daring to get any closer.   Aemond scoffed shaking his head “Don’t lie to me” He asked turning to her the dirt on his cheeks were stained giving away the tears he had shad “My egg will never hatch and there’s no dragon for me to claim. Don’t be cruel Ysilla.”  Ysilla observed the boy in front of her he desperately wanted to prove himself to all of them to himself and the hurt on his face was so visible as if Ysilla was feeling it herself. Her words must have felt like another jest and of that she felt bad.  “Aemond” she spoke softly taking a step towards her cousin “I was not trying to to be cruel I hope you know that” she assured “What I meant is that mayhaps here in King’s Landing there are no more dragons to claim but on Dragonstone there are. Vermithor Silverwing or the three wild dragons as well.”  Aemond looked at her skeptical “And I could bend one?”  “You are a Targaryen my prince” she said looking at him in the eyes “There is nothing you cannot do.”  “Other Targaryens do not think so” he answered with frustration “They see me fit for a pig.”  Ysilla moved her hand so that she could lift Aemond face with her fingers “Velaryon are not Targaryen. They seem rather strong to me but they are not us.” Her words seemed to surprise him and when he saw her lips turn up into a smile he timidly did the same. “Don’t be bothered by those kids.” As for his brother however…  Aegon liked to jest never thinking about consequences. He never thought about consequences. He never cared about consequences not until he had fun with it. She wanted to speak to her cousin they had grew up together and he was probably the one she knew best the one she was the closest to the one who made her angry the most.   But when she arrived behind the hidden door of the passage Ysilla heard a voice.  “Aemond is your brother.”  It was the Queen. She must have already talked with the King.   Ysilla wondered if the King would have done something about what had happened—at least scold his son and nephews. The Queen had been so angry after Aemond had left for his chambers to clean himself. Ysilla understood how the Queen felt and she would have liked to have a chance to talk with Aegon before his mother wanted any explanation.   “Well he’s a twat” Ysilla shook her head hearing Aegon’s muffled voice.  Gods Aegon she thought in silence.  “We are family” the Queen spoke “You may cuff him about as you wish at home but in the open world we must defend our own.”   “It was funny” she heard Aegon answer simply.  Ysilla took a deep breath. Sometimes even the family itself can be dangerous. But that was not the case with Aemond and Aegon. They were just boys. Ysilla wished that Aegon had paid a bit more attention to his own siblings. He should cherish his family.  “Do you think Rhaenyra’s sons will be your playthings forever?” The Queen asked not trying to hide her irritation. “As things stand Rhaenyra will ascend the throne and Jacaerys Targaryen will be her heir.” Ysilla got closer to the wall to hear at her best.  “So?” Aegon seemed lost and that made her mother groan out loudly.  “You are nearly a man-grown. How is it that you can be so shortsighted?” The Queen’s tone was full of frustration anger and disappointment. But Ysilla could understand Aegon’s confusion. He would never think about the consequences and Ysilla herself had found herself lost when the Queen had spoken to her about the danger their family was running into.   Does every family plot on killing each other for power? Or is just our prerogative? Ysilla thought as her mind went back to the last time she had seen her mother ride away for hawking coming back as a corpse; cold and still as a little girl of five found out that her own father had been the cause of that tragedy. And for what? To be wed to Rhaenyra? Become prince consort? Was that his plot?   Daemon Targaryen had left her motherless for a whim and as he gained nothing Ysilla had lost everything. The wrath that she felt every time she thought about her father was something that light such a fire within her a fire that she desperately wanted to free somehow. But she had learnt the art of dignity and the taste of patience. She knew that the King would have never done anything to his precious brother and yet Ysilla still dreamt of a day where her father would face the consequences of his crimes.   “If Rhaenyra comes into power your very life could be forfeit. Aemond’s as well” the Queen spoke again “She could move to cut off any challenge to her succession.”  Would Rhaenyra commit such crime against her own brothers to secure her position and the one of her bastards sons? She once was so close to Daemon Targaryen wearing the shiny Valyrian neckless that he had gifted for her as if it hold some kind of a promise between them. Such a beautiful neckless Ysilla thought bitterly. My neck still remains unadorned.   A bond like the one Rhaneyra and Daemon shared could lead them to the same crimes? Ysilla did not wish to learn the answer she would have not learnt the answer. She had already lost her family. She could not lose another. She refused to. Aegon and his siblings would not pay the price to let bastard ascend to the Iron Throne. She could see it. But Aegon…  “Then I won’t challenge…” Aegon was cut of but the Queen’s screams. A sound that made Ysilla shiver.  “You are the challenge!” She yelled “You are the challenge Aegon! Simply by living and breathing!” Ysilla felt her breath labour as she slid down against the wall. It could happen. It would happen. Politics could be cruel it knew no mercy it knew no family. If a succession war was to happen the first to die would always be the male heir.   “You are the King’s firstborn son” the Queen kept saying “And what they know what everyone in the realm knows in their blood and in their bones is that one day you will be our King.” Ysilla closed her eyes with a heavy sign as she heard the Queen leave Aegon’s chambers. That future didn’t seem so far. The King did not possessed the best of health having lost an arm and getting paler by the day. He still smiled though and she wished that his body would keep living form many years more because once the King would leave that world not everyone would bent the knee to a woman especially after giving birth to bastards and at that point her cousins’ life could be at risk.  “Aegon” she spoke quietly stepping into the room. She heard the boy take a shaky breath. He was about to cry and that sound pained her heart.   “My mother had already scolded me Ysilla” he said pushing his head back as he stood up. Ysilla was quick to turn her back to him noticing that he wasn’t wearing any clothes. It had already happened before so she was not surprised to see him like that but she flushed anyway.   “I’m not here to scold you” she said hearing him cross the room to get his clothes. In truth she was but after what she heard Ysilla felt for him and suddenly she didn’t feel the need to argue with him anymore. You never think about the consequences Aegon.  “So my brother had not come to cry to you as he did with Mother?” He asked with frustration but Ysilla did not answered to that.  “I wished to ride on dragon back” she said turning to look at Aegon “Do you want to come with me?” His eyes widened in surprise as he observed her frame but he nodded none the less.  They were strangely quiet as they made their way to the carriage that would bring them to the Dragonpit. Ysilla quite enjoyed that silence though. Quiet sounds quiet times. Maybe they would all shout too much. She could feel Aegon’s eyes on her though unsure of what to do or say. That behaviour made her smile.  “I was thinking about something” she said suddenly smiling when she saw her cousin take a relieved breath.  “Finally” he said “I wasn’t sure if you were angry with me.” Ysilla observed him.  “You get on my nerves quite easily” she answered making him roll his eyes but the smile never left her lips. “So do you want to hear my thoughts?” She asked fixings her black riding clothes.  “As long as you don’t shout to me like Mother.” He mumbled looking outside the carriage.  “I was thinking about how lucky we are” she said ignoring his scoff “How lucky I am.” That made him frown as he turned to look at her “After my mother I thought I would be alone for the rest of my life but then you all of you let me in this family” she took a breath “You are my family Aegon.”  His eyes stayed on her observing Ysilla with a confused stare “I… I don’t understand…” Ysilla smiled standing up as the carriage came to an halt.   “There’s no need” she said “I do.”   The door got opened by the guard that had escorted them. The man showed her his hand for her to take so that she could safely get out. Ysilla knew she needed to no help but the gallant gesture was much welcomed so she accepted the hand. As she walked towards the Dragonpit she could hear Aegon quick steps coming from behind her.  “You said you wanted to share a thought but you said nothing I didn’t know” he argued still confused. Ysilla laughed.  “I’m glad it is no news to you” she answered fixing the clothes of the gloves around her fingers. Suddenly he took her by the arm making her turn.  “What did you understand that I didn’t?” Ysilla could see the confused frown upon his face how his lips would pout when he got frustrated. That expression made her smile as she swiftly caressed his cheeks.  “Many things my prince” she said freeing herself as her eyes went to Dārysyr. He was being brought to her by the Dragonkeepers. He would slither beautifully on the ground his purple wings lapping in excitement as he saw her like he had done since he was just an hatchling.   “Zȳhon belma qogror”” she said as Dārysyr would get close so that she could touch his snout. His scales were so hot against her gloved fingers. “Gaomagon ao jaelagon naejot sōvegon rūsīr issa?” At her question Dārysyr growled moving his dark wings. (My beautiful friend. Do you want to ride with me?)  Then another growl could be heard but it was different from Dārysyr’s. Its pitch was higher and clearer. She knew who it belonged to.  “Sunfyre” Aegon said with a genuine and happy smile on his face as his beautiful golden and pink dragon would get closer to his rider. Sunfyre was the most expressive among all the dragons and he absolutely adored Aegon. He playfully pushed Aegon as a greeting and Ysilla’s heart got full with fondness as she watch how Aegon caressed his dragon. Her hand would stroke Dārysyr’s neck as he’d protectively went around her as he always did.  “Is my prince ready to take flight?” She asked getting Aegon’s attention back to her.  “Are you ready my lady?” He dared her as he moved to get on Sunfyre’s back.  “Don’t start something when you do not know how it will end” she warned him playfully her securing the belt around her waist as she got comfortable on her saddle but he just scoffed before giving Sunfyre the order so that the dragon could start moving towards the exit.  “Tolot zȳhos ābra zȳhon ñuha.” She said patting Dārysyr’s neck “Sīr zābūbys ābra dārys. Targot dāeri Dārysyr.” (He never thinks about the consequences my friend. I’ll think about consequences then. Fly now Darysir.)  _____________________________________________________________  Taglist: @watercolorskyy @darylandbethfanforever9 @roxannequeen @shadowzena43 @bogbutteronmycroissant @heavenly1927 @aerangi @travelingmypassion @iilsenewman @snoopyspace @anthonys-viscountess @mythicalmikey @callsignwidow @purplegardenwhispers @deltamoon666 @malfoycassimalfoy @ilikechocolatemilkh @plutoisaghoul @herzaydete @mariamyousef702 @nxcxllxsevens @cailinrua @staplerrrr @luna-salem   If you’d like to be added to the taglist please don’t hesitate to let me know.

A “I’m no king! See I don’t even speak the language of kings past!!!” act that now is coming back to bite as he is now king and his brother has a eye for and eye mentality that is deeply rooted in his brain    (but also he tends to go a extra step on his retribution.   Eye for a life - Luke  Humiliation in front of guards for a Humiliation in from of Counsil that undermines the king - Aegon)  Or (an this one is coming from my experience as someone that learned a language that is not my native language and it’s not the language that I speak on my day to day life) he had no one to talk to to train his speech.  Anyone that speaks more than one language will tell you after you learn it the reading and the hearing comprehension are the easiest to keep. The conversation however can start to deteriorate if you don’t practice it.  You can understand it but without someone to speak with (or dedication to set aside a time to speak to yourself out loud in another language) the whole thing becomes less fluid you make more pauses since your brain isn’t making that swift transition from “thinking in first tongue” to “think in second tongue” and your mouth is not used to making these new shapes and producing these unfamiliar sounds.  Out of his family members that speak high Valyrian how many do you think talk to him in the language of their ancestors?,2024-07-09 07:23:55 GMT
75,House of the Dragon,['aegon ii targaryen'  'aemond targaryen'  'hotd'  'hotd spoilers'  'jane.posts'],ellewod,aegon and aemond are two sides of the same coin. they both desperately crave validation.   one craves it in the form of love and devotion. he tries to earn the people‘s favor through kindness by being a decent king who cares for the well-being of his people. he tries to buy their love and desperately seeks approval from them because he feels deeply insecure and knows he isn’t fit to rule. how could he since everyone keeps reminding him of the fact that he is not and never will be.  the other has been bullied his whole life — partly by his older brother who was simply cruel at times but lately felt deeply hurt by his brother’s actions as they caused the death of his beloved son. they never talk about this or any other hurt they’ve caused each other though because that’s just not their nature. he seeks power as he hates how powerless he felt as a child a targaryen without a dragon continually made fun of. he tries to earn his place in history through ruthlessness and brutality.  thinking about what could’ve been their dynamic this season makes me want to cry.,2024-07-09 07:19:51 GMT

Rating: MA15+  Links: Dividers / Masterlist   Words: 1.6K  Summary: The beginning of House Raengyreon and House Targaryen. The history of the two houses joining together. Meshing together as one.   Next Chapter  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Aelora Targaryen.  Aelora Raengyreon Targaryen.  Her parentage?   Vhaelys Targaryen and Rhaenar Raengyreon.   Rhaenar Raengyreon is the son of an ancient dragonlord of Valyrian house. House Raengyreon it is an old house. It is just as old as House Targaryen. According to some people mythic legends it might have been older. Even then it entirely relies on the storyteller. Depending on what myth is told. How it is told. Along with what details are left in and taken out.   Entirely shaping how someone else could see House Raengyreon. Some feared it. Some became suspicious. Others loved to hate them for whatever reason they might have had. One thing was clear. Every telling about them? No two are ever the same.   Raengyreon known for its love of preserving of every possible part of Valyrian culture. Including its militia warships art and music. Anything and everything Valyrian deemed deserving of preservation. The mindset of preserving everything they could. Echoing into the descendants of the house.   Adapting while preserving as much they could. Loving their past while adapting for the future. Hand in hand like a story of two lovers doomed to die together. Like a comet falling from the sky and killing people if it lands inside a city with a large populace.   Either way. They loved both the past and the future. Letting go of one would be akin to severing a limb from their body with a rusted serrated blade. Leaving chunks of flesh behind. Barely hanging on dangling from the mutilated limb like a piece of string.   Months before the betrothal would become official. Rhaenar serenaded Vhaelys. Often singing valyrian songs to pique her interest. Frequently giving her rather lavish gifts in a colour of her house. House Targaryen. Red ruby necklaces with silver. Black extravagant dresses. Which would fall down to the floor.   His own dragon unlike Vhaelys’s dragon is a sea serpent. He introduced to her as Vermith. To create a connection with her going beneath the layers of a typically normal courtship. Vermith his sea dragon. Deemed long enough to wrap around Dragonstone twice. Almost three times.  He knew of her House he knew of how they valued their dragons and their might. He knew it was another way to speak to her on a different level entirely. Not only that but he valued her dragon as well. Often praising Jēda Vhaelys’s dragon in Valyrian. As much as he could and whenever he was able to.  Dragons were his passion as well. He felt as if every dragon no matter how big or small deserved to be praised.   Vermith he is normally passed down to firstborn children to help them adapt to dragons and their care. To ensure children knew how to treat a dragon with proper care and respect. In doing so they would know how to care for their own dragon once they reached a proper age. Normally when the child would reach the age of 16.   Aelora’s older brother Aelor given Vermith. Once he had reached the age of 16. As it is his birthright as the firstborn. Adamant in showing him off to his younger sister Aelora. In turn she loved it more than anything else. Seeing something huge powerful and ancient like Vermith fuelled her imagination like a frantic poet wishing to love something she could not have.    “He is so huge.” Aelora gasped her voice filled with awe and wonder.  “When you get your own dragon. I’m sure they will be just a beautiful.” Aelor reminded her.  “You think so?” Aelora Targaryen tilted her head at the notion of her own dragon. Her older brother Aelor Targaryen. “I hope it is just as pretty as Vermith.”  Aelor chuckled ruffling his sister’s hair. “Even prettier little sis. Maybe it’ll be silver and shimmer like moonlight.”  “Like moonstone or opal?” Aelora pressed thinking of the possibilities. “Perhaps even like the stain glass windows in the septs?”  Aelor the patient loving brother knelt before Aelora bringing himself to her level. “It could be all of those things and more” he said a smile gracing his lips. “Imagine a dragon with scales that shimmered like moonlight catching every colour like a living kaleidoscope. Or maybe its wings would be translucent like stained-glass their hues deepening and lightening as it soared through the sky.”  Aelora’s eyes sparkled with excitement. A dragon like that so unlike the usual blacks and greens of their family’s mounts felt fantastical almost mythical. “Do you think such a dragon exists brother?” she whispered her voice filled with a childlike wonder.  Aelor grinned. “There are tales whispers of dragons from the Valyrian Freehold before the Doom” he explained his voice hushed with reverence. “Dragons with scales that shimmered like twilight and eyes like molten gold. Perhaps your dragon will be a descendant of one of those magnificent creatures.”  “That would be so cool.” Aelora’s mind buzzed with ideas. “Like the story mother said about the large creatures of the sea. Like the big prehistoric sharks.” Sharks were her favourite creature. Ironic since Vermith was a sea serpent.   “I like to think there are as many types of dragons as there are sharks.” Aelora confessed to Aelor. As if it was some kind of dark and hidden secret. “From flying ones to the ones in the deep sea.”  Aelor’s smile faltered slightly. “Dragons” he corrected gently “are a whole different story Aelora. They are intelligent creatures not beasts like sharks. They choose their riders and the bond between them is unlike anything else in the world.”  “I… I… I know silly.” Aelora replied. “There are many….many breeds of sharks. Some we do know about and the ones we don’t know about. It stands to reason that there are dragon types we may never know about. Think about it. A deep sea dragon of bioluminescence or like the fish with a light that lures their food or even one that has transparent body that would reveal their squishy insides.”  Aelor laughed his earlier apprehension melting away. “Alright alright” he conceded. “Maybe there are some deep-sea dragons lurking in the shadows feasting on bioluminescent fish with their squishy insides.” He teased making a face that contorted his features in mock horror.  Aelora giggled shoving him playfully. “See? You can imagine it too!”  Aelor chuckled dodging Aelora’s playful shove with practised ease. A glint of something akin to admiration flickered in his eyes. “You have a very.…imaginative mind Aelora” he admitted. “Perhaps you should be the one writing the dragon stories not me.”  “Maybe I will” Aelora countered a spark of determination lighting up her face. “My deep-sea dragon could be a real terror of the deep! Imagine with razor-sharp teeth and glowing scales that could blind its prey!”  Aelor tapped his chin thoughtfully. “Intriguing. But wouldn’t a glowing creature be easily spotted in the dark depths?”  “Aha!” Aelora exclaimed her eyes widening with a new idea. “Then it could have bioluminescent lures like those angler fish! It could attract its prey with a beautiful light display then BAM! Dinner!”  Aelor threw his head back and laughed a rich genuine sound that warmed the air. “See Aelora? That’s why you should be a storyteller! That’s brilliant.”  Aelora beamed basking in his praise. “So do you believe there could be deep-sea dragons now?”  Aelor considered this for a moment. “The world is a vast and mysterious place Legends often hold a sliver of truth. Who knows what secrets might lie hidden in the uncharted depths?” He winked. “Perhaps one day you’ll be the one to discover them Captain Aelora of the Deep!”  Aelora’s heart swelled with a mixture of excitement and a strange thrilling anticipation. “Captain Aelora of the Deep” she repeated savouring the sound of it. A mischievous grin spread across her face. “Maybe… I… I… I will.”  Aelora drew pictures of deep-sea dragons. The art journal large enough to be the size of a map folded in half. She had books of encyclopedias of deep sea creatures around her. She would take inspiration from the large heavy books.  The picture of a future warship she called it “The Defiant Blood Rose” or simply “Blood Rose” depending on what name someone would have called it. It bore a massive valyrian steel blade in the front to cut through ice ships and sea creatures that would dare to attack it. The main wood used? Combination of oak teak and mahogany to create a strong and resilient hull. Her idea to the shipwrecks of older ships to create a mosaic of reclaimed wood each plank whispering tales of past voyages and battles.  The figurehead made of marble in the shape of a siren at the back of the ship to ward away potential thieves. In a scribbled note “A sign there is danger here. Enter at your own peril.” and the massive blade “To cut through a ship or chunks of ice like a knife through butter.”  Canons either side of it spewing fire and lead in a deadly dance meant to emulate the bioluminescent lures of her deep-sea dragon. A captain’s quarters with a massive window overlooking the ocean a sprawling map covering most of the known world a sextant and spyglass resting on a sturdy table beside a comfortable armchair. The bed? A bed nook built into the hull of the ship facing the window allowing the Captain to wake up to the sunrise over the waves.  “Someday this will be a real warship. Someday it will exist. Someday I Aelora Targaryen will sail the Blood Rose across uncharted seas a captain not just of men but of the very legends whispered on the wind.”,2024-07-09 08:55:49 GMT

Not TG but Alicent. It seems like she doesn’t have any agency other that the dying words of her late husband who she keeps refering as an amazing king. She keeps acting like she doesn’t love her kids like if war could be avoided (she can’t be this stupid I’m sorry) like if Aegon had chose to be King and she had prepared him his entire life for this like if everything is other people fault. Episode 4…. She is only looking to prove her point instead of actually helping her sons or attending to her daughter or showing up at the council. When Aegon asks for advice (lit he asked) she just insults him. Why are they writing her like this? Why isn’t she having some real opinions and position in this war? Why isn’t she supporting her children? Trying to protect them?  I can get she is not a perfect mother like Rhaneyra BUT show some concern some love. It feels like she could actually betray her family and go off with Rhaenyra (i don’t think they’re gonna go there but it feels like it)   The reason why I still like Criston despite everything is bc he is committed to a cause he worries for the greens he has his own strenghts he was horrifies at the end when aegon fell. If Criston Cole can care like this why Alicent can’t? Even Larys seems more preocupied with the kids and the situation than her.,2024-07-09 08:36:20 GMT

Dovevo essere sicura che non ci fosse un altro modo per poter affrontare tutto questo”. Con queste parole Rhaenyra (una sempre più straordinaria Emma D&#x27;Arcy) conferma ancora una volta la propria grazia e risolutezza parlando al proprio Concilio Ristretto nel quarto episodio della seconda stagione di House of the Dragon (2x04). Dopo il dialogo chiarificatore nella scorsa puntata tra lei e Alicent (Olivia Cooke) in cui si sono parlate finalmente a cuore aperto sulle ultime parole del defunto regnante e sulle loro responsabilità la legittima erede al Trono di Spade decide di passare definitivamente all&#x27;azione. Bisogna affrontare i Verdi e bisogna farlo a cavallo dei propri draghi!  Le conseguenze dell&#x27;amore (e del potere) Il machiavellismo di Aemond non conosce confini  La proverbiale e decantata Danza dei Draghi ha quindi inizio nel senso più letterale del termine: la lotta è interna intestina civile non solo tra le due fazioni della famiglia Targaryen i Verdi e i Neri ma anche all&#x27;interno delle stesse. Nessuno è immune questa la regola di House of the Dragon. È così che le conseguenze dello scorso episodio si fanno sentire e lo scontro tra Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney) e Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) al bordello ha un riflesso immediato nell&#x27;altra riunione del Concilio di questo episodio: Aemond parla valyriano molto bene e dimostra di essere un potenziale regnante molto più in gamba del fratello (che prima della sua incoronazione illegittima lo aveva supplicato di prendere il suo posto) perché non è preda di impulsi repentini ed è un abile e machiavellico stratega. Quella sequenza recitata ottimamente da entrambi i giovani interpreti serve proprio a dare al pubblico la misura della lotta per il potere ad ogni costo senza guardare mai faccia a nessuno nel mondo di Martin. Soprattutto nella Casa del Drago. Le mire di tutti continuano senza sosta: Harrenhal è stato oramai preso dai Neri e da Daemon nonostante sia il castello della famiglia di Piededuro (Matthew Needham) da generazioni ma quest&#x27;ultimo ha i propri interessi a palazzo.  Liberate i draghi! Una delle poche coppie “sane” di tutta Westeros  Aegon avrebbe voluto liberare i draghi non lo hanno ascoltato e questo è il risultato. Queste almeno le parole del giovane Re al Concilio dove oramai alla guerra non ci si può più tirare indietro. È così che assistiamo al primo vero scontro in volo tra Neri e Verdi con le maestose creature che popolano i cieli di Westeros a farla da padroni insieme ai loro cavalieri per dare una svolta decisiva alla Danza. Lo farà molto più di quanto fosse lecito aspettarsi nel corso dell&#x27;episodio e dell&#x27;evoluzione della trama con quel senso di pathos e di epica antica e cavalleresca che ha sempre contraddistinto anche Il Trono di Spade. È così che le pedine in gioco sulla scacchiera non si accontenteranno di buttare giù qualche pedone ma punteranno proprio allo scacco matto… ma non come ci saremmo aspettati. Una delle più grandi doti della narrazione di Martin viene confermata in questo quarto incredibile episodio che arriva non a caso a metà stagione a proporre un importante giro di boa per le puntate a venire. Il potere è qualcosa che inebria e fa perdere la testa pur di ottenerlo o reclamarlo davanti a tutti i propri sottoposti e familiari: anche nelle piccole vittorie come fa Ser Criston.  Una danza nel cielo Ser Larys continua i propri intrighi di palazzo  Se la stagione era iniziata con “un figlio per un figlio” si potrebbe dire che arriviamo alla svolta con “un drago per un drago” e lo scontro nei cieli è davvero reso ottimamente a livello visivo e registico. Un&#x27;opportunità per esplorare meglio anche i rapporti tra i draghi e i propri cavalieri e la loro simbiosi millenaria e lo si può notare benissimo nel rapporto tra Rhaenys la Regina che non fu e il suo drago Meleys la Regina Rossa il toccante ultimo sguardo tra le due prima della loro inesorabile sorte ha portato più di qualche lacrima. Più claudicanti paradossalmente e simbolicamente sono quelli tra esseri umani e consanguinei: Rhaenys (Eve Best) e Corlys (Steve Touissant) si confermano forse i più stabili all&#x27;interno del regno ma anche per loro vale la regola scuoti un matrimoni e verranno fuori segreti. Ci sono poi due sequenze speculari perfettamente girate: Alicent dice al primogenito “La Corona non fa il Re. Non è che indossandola si diventa automaticamente adatti a regnare”. Forse dopo il dialogo con Rhaenyra e pur avendolo messo lei stessa su quel trono per aver travisato le ultime parole di Viserys si rendo conto di tutto ciò che non va nel proprio nucleo bramando che abbia ereditato anche solo la metà del talento di Viserys. Parallelamente c&#x27;è il confronto tra Rhaenyra e il suo primogenito Jacaerys (Harry Collett) in cui gli rivela ciò che Viserys le aveva confidato anni prima: la Canzone del ghiaccio e del fuoco ovvero la profezia che dà il titolo all&#x27;intera saga letteraria di Martin. Proprio a sottolineare la differenza tra le due famiglie e i diversi rapporti madre-figlio. La prima metà dell&#x27;episodio è quindi tutta di preparazione alla battaglia per arrivare attraverso un climax narrativo ben strutturato e soppesato nella seconda metà ad uno scontro avvincente ed appassionante che fino all&#x27;ultimo non sai come potrebbe concludersi( beh tolte le persone che hanno letto Fire and Blood).  Conclusioni Il quarto episodio della seconda stagione di House of the Dragon (2x04) fa entrare definitivamente gli spettatori nella proverbiale Danza dei Draghi attraverso una struttura perfettamente speculare: una prima metà di confronti e conseguenze dello scorso episodio dialoghi e riunioni dei Concili volti a rivelare lo stato delle relazioni tra i personaggi e le due fazioni Targaryen in gioco soprattutto al loro interno. Per poi passare ad una seconda parte estremamente action che ci fa volare alto insieme ai possenti draghi e ai loro cavalieri per uno scontro registicamente entusiasmante che regala sorprese e non lascia scampo a nessuno. Siamo prontissimi per ciò che verrà o forse no.  👍🏻 Finalmente l’azione per chi l’aveva tanto bramata! Il confronto Aegon/Aemond al Concilio Ristretto e quello tra le due madri Rhaenyra/Alicent e i rispettivi figli Jacaerys/Aegon. Il rapporto tra Drago e Cavaliere Le scene tra Rhaenys e Meleys davvero stupende e toccanti. Rhaenys e Corlys unica coppia “sana” in quel nido di vipere o che almeno cerca di comunicare. La sequenza della battaglia sia a livello narrativo che visivo. Potrebbe sembrare che alcune sequenze dei vari intrighi di palazzo servano solo a rimandare l’inevitabile ma in realtà hanno un significato narrativo. 👎🏻 Potrebbe sembrare che alcune sequenze dei vari intrighi di palazzo servano solo a rimandare l’inevitabile ma in realtà hanno un significato narrativo. Perché chi vuole solo azione tali scene posso sembrare inutili. Ma è più che altro un mettere in guardia chi cerca solo azione è tra gli intrighi di corte che si svolge la vera azione.,2024-07-09 08:30:36 GMT

Reader preview Word count:133   Warnings: pregnancy Aegon is his own warning and labor.   A/n: hey y&#x27;all I’ve never wrote fanfiction before let alone posted it. I was thinking i could maybe try it out. This is a snippet from a fanfic I’m working on and would really appreciate your feedback and opinions if I should post the full thing. Thank you! Enjoy!        Screams could be heard through the red keep servants scrambling grabbing towels. The princess had gone into labor. Aegon is drowning in his cups as usual. He groaned as he clutched his head what was all this commotion about? He jumps up as his mother the queen slams open the door. The displeasure of being interrupted and his headache did not help his mood to not be sour. “What? Must you be so loud?” He looked up at his mother noticing his mother’s scared expression and labored breathing. “Mother?” the prince asked now suddenly sobering up at the sight of his usually calm mother so stressed and disturbed. The queen stared at her son and said in a Shakey voice “y/n has begun her labors.” Aegon jumped up from his bed and quickly rushed out the door with Alicent following him. “Where is she? In her chambers?” Alicent quickly replied “yes she’s in her chambers with the maester and a couple midwives. She was asking for you.” Aegon may not be the most caring person to his wife but he loved her in his own way. He could feel his heart beating like it did when they got married. The halls feel never-ending as they make their way do the princess’s chamber. When they finally make it to the door they can hear cry of pain and hushed talking between the midwives and the maester.,2024-07-09 08:26:26 GMT

I think he’s something worse.  The way show portrays his actions suggest he is self-absorbed person lacking proper emotional intelligence or/and empathy. Like he just for the sake of it do not get that people in certain situations may feel different from him. He does not mean any harm but do not understand what he is doing is in fact a harm. He’s laughing while making jokes about his brother so it not so bad of situation nothing big right? Maybe he is little upset but he will go over it right? Maybe I will take him to brothel at age of barely thirteen but I like sex so he will do too right? Maybe most of the rat catchers were innocent but I’m angry now so everyone will understand why I did right?

NONE OF THE POINTS OF EITHER SIDE OR ANY OPINION ARE EVER TRULY SUPPORTED BY THE NARRATIVE BECAUSE THE NARRATIVE IS PAINFULLY VAGUE AND ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND IT’S CONFUSING. and as a wonderful rolling stone article said not so long ago “confusion doesn’t equal complexity”. it’s an illusion of substantiality. it doesn’t equal anything meaningful really certainly doesn’t equal development; it just pisses you off because you know for a fact that you’re being manipulated and played with   the thing w being vague is - you can’t be confusing and all over the place all the time. not when you’re writing a story that will have to come to an end and result in a conclusion one day. at some point you’re bound to make a statement,2024-07-09 10:48:54 GMT

155,House of the Dragon,['alicent hightower'  'queen alicent'  'hotd'  'anti hotd'],chemicalreal,Sorry Alicent fans but Aegon spent a whole scene rationally lecturing Alicent about how his father couldn’t have possibly named him his heir only to be treated with smug contempt by the same woman who forcefully sat him on that chair because he feels undermined by everyone showing the empathy of a sociopath simply because he didn’t keep some Viserys’ book in his room (and muh RATCATCHERS)?  Alicent basking in bullying her own son alongside the rest even after he genuinely sits and asks for her advice since she wanted it making up accomplishments she never had and not giving two sh*ts about the grandchild who was brutally murdered under her roof? Olivia Cooke reiterates it saying that she refuses to comfort him because his vulnerability disgusted her leaves no room for doubts even when you could think she went away for different reasons. Does this just confirm she only considered him as long as she believed her half rotten husband said he was the heir?  Why doesn’t she just piss off and join her dearest Rhaenyra’s camp at this point if she hates him so much? She already let her escape after her foolish intrusion which is literally treason.  I’m just dumbfounded by the levels of unbelievable apathy reached in every episode that has the clear goal to portray the greens as the worst possible mix of Boltons Lannisters and Greyjoys (include the sand snakes too).,2024-07-09 11:47:07 GMT

High and sharp winds have started growing in the North sweeping far south of The Wall and clawing at the gates of Winterfell.    Tonight was no different. You had asked your handmaiden to build a fire in the hearth for both your comfort but with little gain. As soon as you stepped away from the red licking flames the cold took over like shadow vanquishing light.   “It’s all in vain.” you mutter defeated.   “I shall bring more furs m’lady.” your handmaiden insists getting up from her spot by the fire.   “Don’t.” you chuckle “Any more and I’ll suffocate. They’ll have to send all the guards to come looking for me amongst them come morn’.”   Your companion lets a shy laugh escape her trembling lips although short-lived as a tall broad shadow appears by the door.    “My lady.” Your heart flutters wildly at the unmistakable sound of your betrothed’s voice so gentle and concerned. “Are you well?”    Nodding for your handmaiden to retreat to her own chamber you now become aware of your condition; kneeled on the rough tapestry crumbled into a ball of pelts hands above the flames. Sour shame washes over you for having dared to believe you were one of the toughest of your family during harsh times yet now conquered by the cold on your first night in Winterfell.   “Cregan.” you shuffle to raise to your feet but your freezing legs aren’t eager to heed your intent. “I must admit my northern blood has betrayed me tonight for the first time.”     You are startled amidst your struggles to flee from the furs as he braces you with a firm hand on your back before his other comes around your waist easily lifting you off the rugs. He walks back placing you on the soft bed and sitting beside you the covers rigid with night’s chill underneath.   “I will not have my lady wife quiver in my own keep.” He rids himself of his cloak swiftly draping it over your smaller frame. The hastiness of the gesture makes a newfound warmth pool in your veins reminding you of the same way he is to soon cloak you as his lady in sight of the Old Gods.    “Thank you” You whisper surprised and stunned as you cuddle closer into his embrace. His body heat soon seeps into you your trembling diminishing as his strong arms faintly squeeze more and more.    ‘Exhilarated’ didn’t begin to properly describe how you felt when Lord Cregan started courting you not long after he had returned from the southern war of the Targaryens. Your house is pledged to the Starks but with the safety of the North now secured he did not deem it necessary to strengthen alliances with marriage anymore not when he could follow his heart so freely.   A giddy shiver rouses you from oncoming slumber as the last slither of cold leaves your body in a sneeze you wished you could suppress.    “Come closer.” You can feel his hot breath on your face as he moves you over his lap his right arm running up and down your back in hopes of keeping you warm.   “Is this proper? So soon before the wedding?” You do not wish to so easily disrespect customs and laws but it wasn’t rare that you found yourself fantasising about finally being his.   “I am merely looking after my beloved. I already vowed to shield you from harm.” You cannot tell if there was a trace of amusement in his tone or if it was just your mind jesting.   “Not before the gods.”   “The gods knew of the pledge before I could speak it. The ceremony will be held but my loyalties will have been with you for long before.” The hold around your waist tightens affectionate.   You look up at him pondering your next words carefully; but before you could muster up a word your eyes drift to his lips only for a moment. He doesn’t need a clearer impulse to proceed.  His mouth meets yours with a warm exhale that seems to bewitch you all senses and shock diffusing into the need of being with him. Your face is hot the skin of your waist is buzzing under his touch even through thick clothing. Your kiss is shy despite his growing hunger. He nips at your soft lips his right hand cradling your face warm and calloused yet so tender.  His left palm grazes your thigh a reassuring safety seasoned with soft need.   You cannot dream of stopping him. Your only concern is him ceasing at an awful time only to return to his usual honourable self and leave you desperate until the wedding. But he does not back away more and more enraptured with you the scent of you your skin and your soft sighs.   He kisses down your jaw down your throat wet hot and open-mouthed. Your body has forgotten all about the sting of cold leaning back onto the furs. He follows without breaking away climbing on top of you slowly yet steadily. You moan in surprise as he begins to toy with the back strings of your dress.  “If you wish me gone I will be gone at once wife.” He vows.  Returning into view he looks at you from atop his brows soothing at the realisation that you are about to welcome him.  “Warm my bed tonight husband.” You utter a feather’s puff aways from his lips.  With that he descends upon you tasting your words on your lips his hands cradling your liquified body like softened candle wax. You’re burning up and twisting with excitement under the blazing flame of his heat.   His hands slowly rid you of your garments leaving you in your white shift before slipping underneath and grabbing your waist. His touch leaves your skin aching and burning behind his kisses mark you in a scorch palpable only to you. His touch climbs past your waist coming to fondle the soft flesh of your breasts. Your heart beat is so strong you swear he might feel it as he softly squeezes your tit.  You shuffle in his hold seeking to press yourself closer and closer into him as if to become one. He indulges himself wanting to wrap you up entirely in his embrace. Your soft breasts come flush against his hard chest legs curling up around his waist as you receive him between your parted thighs.   His breathing gradually becomes laboured as he moves against you pulling the covers over you both. As he continues to caress the curves and dips of your shape his groin brushes up against your flower and your hips betray you dragging back up against him. With a low grunt he frees himself from his breeches with one hand and you pull at his chemise to fully undress him.  “Are you certain?” You inquire out of breath.  “Always have been.” He soothes your worries with another heart-stopping kiss sealing the premature bedding with an undoubting vow.  You feel him guide himself into you the tip of his manhood prodding at the pink petals of your unplucked rose claiming you. He pushes in and you gladly accept him wet and wanting.   “Gods you feel amazing.” He groans above you finally settled completely into you before pulling back out and starting to roll his hips steady yet hard enough to have you tensing at the sudden feeling of kindles in your womb.   He sinks deep into you with every thrust breathing heavy on your neck groaning in your ear whipping at the cold and dark of the bedchamber. You can smell the pinewood and musk on him closer than you’ve ever been before and it drowns out your senses reducing you to the rapid waters of a river bending and breaking against harsh stones of mountains willing and united.   You gasp out his name as the air is filled with your moans and pleas the wood-carved bed frame ramming into the bleak stone walls of Winterfell with an echoless rhythm.   He worships your body like you were a godly grace bestowed upon him listening to your every sound and heeding every sign that he could do more for your pleasure. Eventually his thrusts grow urgent and scattered in between breaths and before he can muffle your ecstatic whines with another kiss you come your delicate flower quivering around him pushing him into the peak of his own satisfaction.   You feel him throb inside filling you with a strange new sensation. He collapses by your side tenderly dragging you with him. He strokes up and down your back his breaths calming with a deep sigh.  “Is my lady still in discomfort?” He jests lightly proud with himself and immensely content.  You snuggle at his side head on his chest. “No. But I’m afraid I will be in need of your aid every night my lord.”,2024-07-09 11:45:50 GMT

When the episode ended I needed a cigarette to calm myself and just ponder the episode. Rhaenys’ character was just so amazing the acting first of all was exceptional.. And I loved her characters wisdom bad ass nature and loyalty. She never got to fight for her throne our queen who never was but she put her all into helping Rhaenyra claim her rightful throne. She knew she wasn’t going to win but threw herself back into the battle which is so brave (maybe a lil dumb too). The looks that passed between her and Melys was so 😙🤌 for me they did such a good job making a cgi dragon show his bond with Rhaenys and even showing emotions. When Melys’ throat was bit down on and she looked back at Rhaenys I just couldn’t stop the tears. The dragons make me think of war horses historically… the animals had no choice in being involved in battle and war but many horses are loyal to their riders and will do what is asked of them despite danger. The dragons are a more dangerous and large scale version of that. The animal lover in me hurts🥲 and I will just miss Rhaenys so much! She was one of my faves. That episode punched me in the gut!!

Putting aside her unattainable ambitions- at least he possessed the balls to properly counsel her hence she chose him of all people.  Not a lot had happened in those two days though her father was more emotionally challenged.  Apparently Prince Daemon with the City Watch had mutilated and murdered petty criminals.  Elspeth had never had too many dealings with the dark horse of the Targaryens but had enough to distance herself from the rogue.  The woman had also had no interaction with Ser Harwin Strong. She didn’t know how to feel about that- having an innate desire to search among a sea of faces hoping that she’d see his. Elspeth shrugged that off as an aversion technique but the anguish when she didn’t find him spoke otherwise.  She had always envied Rhaenyra for the primary reason that she could ride dragons- be in the wilds if she wished. Just as she held hatred of man’s freedom to fulfil any role they desired while women were made to battle in bed chambers and birthing chairs.  The woman felt more kin towards the Targaryens than her own. She loved seeing her princess in the clouds - what a rush that would be. It wasn’t foretold for Elspeth thankful she hadn’t been roasted alive by  Having missed Syrax’s flying session she was glad a tourney was taking place- maybe it could provide the rush always wanting in her veins “I missed you at the Dragonpit” proper and upfront- that’s why they got on so well. Rhaenyra stood in a blood-coloured frilled gown- exiting the carriage.  “What was keeping you?” Elspeth had to stifle her amusement. Not that Rhaenyra looked ridiculous.  “Did King Viserys pick this out for you?” Brow quirked lips in a smirk. Her best friend returned the sentiment.  “What made it obvious? The frills or the patterns?” Bunching it up by the mid hem.  Rhaenyra eyed what the Hightower wore. “Are you sure you don’t have dragon blood?” Referring to the black and gold gilded gown the woman wore. Its neckline was high and crossed sleeves short- nothing too fancy. She needn’t impress the councillors nor onlookers.  Elspeth tutted “None hold more disappointment than I Princess” they walked- the older assumed she would receive an earful from her father for being late. “You should have a sibling by the end of events.” Rhaenyra smiled it was a momentous occasion for her. She seemed excited for the company of a brother or sister- Rhaenyra convinced it will be a little girl called ‘Visenya&quot;.  “Yes Visenya is on her way. I can’t imagine going through labours- I’m not in a hurry” Elspeth nodded her younger siblings provided a strong deterrent to following her &#x27;wifely duties. Others seemed to enjoy the deed committed to be with child not that the girl of nineteen knew personally. “So… what kept you from the Dragonpit? Syrax missed you- she’s quite fond of your presence. Soon she’ll be able to bear two riders…”  A purse of her lips “I fear the dragoness would send me to my death if I saddled her. I don’t possess your lineage Rhaenyra and Hightowers would make the worst dragon riders. You and I both know that.” They started to ascend the steps up to the entrance and where the most powerful people in Westeros watched the events.  Their laughs quieted down hushed by the cheers from around- only the king audible and able to translate.     “I know many of you travelled long leagues to be at these games. But I promise you will not be disappointed. When I look at the fine knights in these lists. I see a group without equal in our histories. And this great day has been made more auspicious by the news… that I am happy to share: Queen Aemma has begun her labours!”     They had sneaked to their seats- sat either side of Alicent in the front row. Rightful cheers ensued-Elspeth one of thousands in attendance. She knew Rhaenyra never wanted the fate of the kingdoms in her hands - she wanted to fly around on Syrax for the remainder of her days. A male heir would make sure that happened. “May the luck of the Seven shine upon all combatants!” An eruption of applause. She found herself politely clapping.  “Who’s first?” Directed at no one in particular.  Calculating by sigils on armour.  Somebody beat them to the punch “Opening this wondrous tournament. Ser Casten Tully” a streak of blue and silver “His opponent- the strongest knight in the Seven Kingdoms Ser Harwin Strong!” Something leapt inside of her- head perking. Navy forest and carmine flashed and glimmered with armour.     &lt;!-- more --&gt; In a blink of an eye Ser Casten was in a bundle on the floor- his beige steed a few feet away.  Cradling his shoulder a broken collarbone maybe.  Her focus on the man was short lived. Ser Harwin trotted over on horseback- helmet lifted and his eyes were straight on her “Lady Elspeth Hightower I stayed true to my word.” Eyes not daring to roll as she stood from the stool.  She draped her hands over the boundary- elbows rested on stone. “I’m afraid I haven’t made a wreathe” Elspeth was dismissive. Stifling that guilt deep down in her chest.  “You could give him your necklace…” Fucking Rhaenyra. What was she playing at?  Oh he looked oh-so amused with himself. “Are you going to deny a knight his favour?” He was lucky he was handsome. Fingers fiddled to undo the clasp of her golden chained emerald encrusted piece of jewellery. Sliding it down his lance. “No kind words?”  “Don’t push it Strong” she spoke through gritted teeth. Gods above she was in trouble. Especially when he wore the necklace- smuggled with his chainmail and chest plate.     Then he was gone.     She returned to her seat. Alicent and Rhaenyra sharing looks of amusement “Was that why you were absent from the Dragonpit?” The answer as clear as her silence was loud. Chin up and observing the next rounds of the joist. Gwayne was on the lists but Ser Criston Cole was the cream of the crop. Fairly unknown but his reputation from the Stormlands had preceded himself. And he didn’t disappoint she overhead Westerling’s information as he spoke to the Princess.   For every other knight she didn’t pay attention. “Ser Harwin Strong!” But him eyes trained on him while he took a lap around the list field. He seemed to notice bowing on his horse at her- that smile prominent under the helmet. Alicent gasped as Rhaenyra laughed in a quiet manner. Elspeth didn’t know how that made her feel although her cheeks felt warm.   The woman maintained her composure. “His opponent Ser Gwayne Hightower!” Her arm was touched by a concerned Alicent. Harwin had a reputation for near killing his competitors- it was a worry. Not that she had control over the events.  “Gwayne will be fine.”  Elspeth was pissed off. So much so she had left the royal balcony storming down to the knights’ village. Finding exactly who she was looking for “You let him unhorse you” the dishevelled hair didn’t help her unexplainable infatuation. While he stood there unlinking his armour.   “Your Lord brother was better than me that can be changed with more training” He remained so calm and gentle. As he always had and she presumed would continue to be; riling her up even more.   She paced ever so close to the man chin up attempting to look more foreboding “Why did you let Gwayne beat you?”   “Ser Gwayne is a fine knight.”  “He may be a fine knight but he can’t unhorse you” her chest met his; heart skipping maybe that wasn’t hers. He hadn’t looked away- staring into Elspeth’s eyes as she did his.   That harsh edge to her melted as he dipped his head down “Did you want me to win my Lady?” Ending at the shell of her ear Elspeth sucked in a breath.   The woman sought to maintain her composure “I trusted you wouldn’t sully my honour Ser Strong” faces mere inches away “But I’m sure you won’t repeat that mistake next time…” She took a few steps back- aware of prying eyes of tourney goers and those of knights.   Nothing could hide his look of bemusement “You wish to give me your honour again?” The woman nodded.  “You are the strongest knight in the Seven Kingdoms. You’re one of the best there is.” A wave of pride on his face but something waged sincerity.   “I didn’t know you to be capable of such flattery my Lady.” He was too happy with himself.  “Don’t push it Strong.” Deja vu as she walked away- turning back to witness that intent look on Harwin’s face “Never forfeit another tourney.”  “Don’t you want your necklace back?”  She waved him off “For next time. Don’t want you forgetting about me” maybe she winked maybe she didn’t. Elspeth was not ready to admit she winked at Harwin Strong. Or that she had given him her most treasured possession.  Those eyes of blue watched the girl “Are you sure Elspeth?” She was weak at her knees. Yet she held it- a weak timid nod. How had they gotten so close again? Whatever the reason Elspeth just wanted him to disappear and let her thoughts remain pure and allow for her to go about her usual day.   Not constantly think about him.  The woman just couldn’t figure the knight out. She couldn’t fathom why in the Known World would he align himself with her? The eldest daughter to the Hand of the King and the most outspoken Lady that the court had known.  Murmurs fluttered the air a blur of orange came into view. “Ser Harwin” The unmistakable voice of her brother. He had to look twice at his sister being in the knight’s village “Sister I think you need to return to your Princess.”  “Does being a stickler ever get old brother?” Unamused and unyielding. Until that look emerged on his face. “Gwayne what’s wrong?” Wide green eyes met his calmed blue.  “The Queen is dead.” Drums thundered around her- only a figment of her imagination but they pounded stronger than her own heart.   Fuck. “Rhaenyra. I’ve got to go.”  Without a second word she found her best friend and held her tight despite declaring she ‘didn’t need’ Elspeth’s sympathies. That didn’t prevent the Princess from melting to the floor in the Hightowers’ arms. Both Elspeth and Alicent cradled her that day. Not speaking a single phrase just sharing each others’ despair.   Queen Aemma was the perfect mother to them all. Never thinking herself to be above any subject. She was a true Queen. And a true Targaryen.   What was the Seven Kingdoms to do without her by Viserys’ side?  And her death was in vain- Prince Baelon only saw the living world for a mere few hours. Elspeth didn’t need a lesson from her father to understand what this meant. The succession of Viserys’ throne was in question. Unless he remarried and produced a male heir or two.   It also meant her father would be in a more ridiculous mood- which meant more suitors in the coming days.  The days went fast and her sanity broke at a quicker rate. She felt Rhaenyra’s pain- that agony. The Princess was there for both the sisters when their Lady mother passed and now they would return the favour. Though Alicent had been stealing her and their mother’s clothes as of late. And had been around the Kings chambers. The woman just hoped Alicent wasn’t being forced to play an adult game at the age of fifteen.   But knowing Otto Hightower and his schemes- that most certainly was the truth. And it made her blood boil.   A crash of doors “What is the meaning of this?”  “Are you so power famished that you’re going to exploit your youngest child? Your daughter?” She sat on the desk he was working on- closing the book that kept his focus even while she spoke. Her stare was that of rages- not surprise “You’re rotten at your very core that throne… Please don’t drag Alicent into your games!”  “Well you certainly won’t do what’s best for this family… Alicent has a keen mind for the way things work in this world.”  “She’s a fucking child who has a misguided idolisation for her father! Mother would never forgive you for this…” Her breath taken as the man she called ‘father’ had his fingers wrapped around her throat. Nails digging further- a crushinh hold. It wasn’t fear running through her. It was pure hatred. “Do it. Kill me. Show them the monster you’ve always been.” It was a struggle worth the pain- he released her from his grip.  Elspeth didn’t know what lurked behind those eyes before. Now she did. A coward and a kingmaker. Her throat felt the construction still coughing to realign any part of her windpipe as soon as slumped outside of the door- not caring what the Kingsguard stationed outside thought. Before their worried faces asked she had charged halfway down the corridor- passing by with steeled manner.   “Lady Elspeth whatever is the matter?” The master of laws Ser Lyonel Strong. One of her father’s peers that made sense she was quite fond of the man. He often checked in with the woman almost like an actual father would. Not that she would know.   She shook her head- politely “Ser Lyonel you are in good health?”  “Child I have known you since you were knee high” Arms crossed “Your Lord father?”   She nodded “I have to attend her grace. I will see you in court Ser.” Elspeth had been wholly unaware of the bruises circling her throat- however the master of laws had not been so ignorant.  Lady Elspeth had not gone to Rhaenyra- a blatant lie so she could venture down and out of the castle. Kings Landing was a much better crowd than Oldtown ever had been.  The woman found herself on the bar counter - wooden and bulking - singing her tunes as somebody tickled the ivories and picked at the strings. A tankard of ale raised in her hand that would be her fifth. Not that she paid for any of them. She knew Bert the owner but vagrants had been stockpiling her in alcohol since she strutted in.   She was among the clouds- unaware if it were the ale or the brute slinging her over his shoulder. Not that the girl argued she was too far gone to walk- it was nice being carried around.  Until her back crashed into a wall “You are foolish for coming here my Lady” so polite yet so gruff at the same time. It ignited something in her.   Anger… lust… Elspeth couldn’t rightly say which “Ugh not you Ser Breakybones…” Eyes rolled taking a step she wasn’t ready to take in that condition- falling into his arms. And she felt safe secure. The woman found herself in the clouds again. So she giggled looking into his stern face. “I’ve always fancied you…” his hand swept away the hair unable to resist sweeping in behind her neck. She couldn’t help but wince.   She felt this man of all men tremble “Who did this? Was it one of those pigs inside?” He let her go for a moment- about to absolute havoc to the patrons until they gave him answers. But a hand on the side of his face stopped him- everything in the man. Eyes widened as if his own heart ceased to beat when he saw her composure unravel and the tears break down Elspeth’s soft skin.   All but shattering. He held her snug while she bawled. Elspeth barely noticed when he carried her all the way to the Red Keep. She’d have appreciated that in consciousness or told him to fuck off.,2024-07-09 13:57:29 GMT

An inability to defend oneself powerlessness fear etc. are not reasons a victim “deserves” their abuse or worse.   Listen to me: abuse under no circumstances is earned by the victim. I don’t care that they didn’t stand up for themselves (could they have? did they personally feel like they could? does it fucking matter?). If someone is a victim of abuse it is not their failure. It doesn’t make them weak for accepting the abuse or feeling like they deserve it. It doesn’t make them frustrating because they don’t have the ability to stand up against their abusers. It doesn’t make them a moral or feminist (when it’s women specifically) failure because they are too afraid to defend themselves.      I see too many arguments that the pain and suffering of a victim is deserved if they don’t radically scream and claw their way out of victim hood. That a victim deserves their abuse if they are in any way accepting of it. This is disgusting rhetoric.      Specifically in the case of Sansa and Alicent. I see too many in this fandom ridicule them and even cheer for their abuse. Simply because they are not in positions to save themselves (and therefore perceived as complacent in abuse). How can you hate the young girls with no rights or freedoms or safety or help for being abused more than their abusers?! How can you blame them for their abuse as if it is their fault and not the sick individuals hurting them? It’s disgusting and people need to take a long and hard look at themselves because while I’m talking about fiction…this rhetoric is clearly indicative of a sickening reality: that society views victims as deserving of abuse if they aren’t fighting.      So I remind you: BEING A VICTIM IS NOT A MORAL FAILURE. VICTIMS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM. ABUSERS ARE,2024-07-09 13:51:56 GMT

Masterlist  The few nights that Aemond Targaryen had spent visiting Madame Sylvie were indeed - strange ones.  He had never thought he might return here; never thought he’d stomach the sight of the woman whom his brother had coaxed him to lay with all those years ago. It seemed as though Aemond could remember that fateful day his thirteenth name day; down to the very last detail. What he had eaten to break his fast that morning the feeling of his mother’s weary smile beaming down at him softly the bitter taste of the ale his brother had poured down his throat before pulling him towards the seedy streets of flea bottom.  He could remember all but the memory of entering into Cock Inn meeting the Madam. That he’d somehow forgotten only the knowledge that it had happened remained.  Yet the first night he returned to Cock Inn suddenly all returned. The aching saccharine scent of the perfumed air the soft flesh of bare whores dancing and of course the peaked eyes of the Madam as she looked upon him.  All were things that seemed to bring him back forcefully to the night Aegon had first brought him here the night he first lay with a woman. There was still a hardened ache of disgust and humiliation in his chest regarding the matter for it had not been an experience Aemond enjoyed. Even now upon returning he wasn’t particularly certain he enjoyed fucking the Madame as he thought he should.  For he hadn’t touched a woman since his name day and strictly returned to the Madam for she felt familiar known to him.  The prince rather preferred taking comfort from the older woman laying upon her soft lap the thick flesh of her arms and thighs cradling his bare body her hands stroking his hair. She was soothing understanding - of course only in a way a whore could be. Afterall Prince Aemond was no fool to think the Madam’s affections extended beyond the coin he paid her. Though it was clear she held some level of care - which for Aemond was more than enough to warrant his actions.  He needed to be soothed cared for - especially after what happened with Lucerys. Especially since he could not bear to see the glimmer of disgust in his own mother’s eyes. After all Aemond had done for her the sacrifice he had made in honour of duty. After all the years Alicent had willingly chosen Aegon to give attention to over himself. He had been starved of love starved of affection. So he sought it in the one place he knew he could get it: Sylvie.  He sighed laying his head gently upon her lap her fingers grazing his scalp. For a moment Aemond pretended the Madam was Alicent that it was she who cooed and praised him softly. Who’s touch was soft like silk upon his taut flesh.  Aemond closed an eye taking in the warmth as the two lay upon a large circular bed in which candles draped all around the stone ledge behind it. Despite the fact he knew the brothel’s surroundings to be the mastery of artificial comfort lulling drunken men even further into depravity - he still could not help to take comfort in it. It was a welcome change from the often dreary halls of the Red Keep - which seemed more like the Sept these days.  The prince coiled himself even further upon the Madam cuddling into her so that he might feel the plushness of her belly upon the back of his head. She felt warm safe - in an odd way. She made him feel as though he was allowed to rip off the mask of strength he had so thoroughly integrated onto himself. Sylvie looked down upon him slightly bewildered yet pitying the young man before her.  It was not until the familiar sounds of her protégé entered the room did her eyes wander from Aemond’s silver hair. She looked up noting the tray the young woman held. Upon it a small copper cup in which she had carefully begun to pour milk within its confines. Sylvie gave her a nod watching as the young woman filed in placing the tray near the bed.  The Madam rarely took in women and girls to mentor into the trade; however her current protégé was undoubtedly one which was most promising. The day she had been bought by the Madame was a most memorable one as it was the first time she had ventured to Lys to select girls of a more prestige history - in order to attract patrons of noble birth.  She had remembered laying eyes upon the girl Sierra she was called a girl of ten and two - born in a Lysene pillow house to one of the women who serviced there. She was a strange thing soft spoken - unsure. She even looked particularly peculiar given the Valerian appearance of most Lysene citizens. Sierra did not bare the silver hair nor purple or pale blue eyes of those whom she lived amongst- instead her hair like aged gold and her eyes stormy.  The girl was odd indeed not quite as lush or alluring as most Lysene but rather moony. However she was prized possession most commonly sought by older noble men or the sons of Lords recently betrothed. Sierra was easily controlled unintimidating so in that way she seemed more like a Lady of the court that a brazen a brothel worker. Sylvie often sent her to men who wished to fuck a maiden and Sierra was most perfect for such desires as in all sense she truly seemed to be one. In that way she was perfect for Aemond unthreatening as so many young whores could be – and most importantly would not remind him of whatever depravities he stifled down within himself.  “Come.” Sylvie gestured to Sierra hailing for her to bring the prince the cup.  As she approached the two upon the bed the prince peaked his head upwards slowly sitting up and taking the cup from the young woman’s hand. Aemond had remembered her from his name day remembered her wide eyes observing him and the Madam for a moment before ducking behind the silken drapes. He had always wondered what such a young girl had been doing in a brothel remembered the coils of her golden curls flickering in the candlelight. Now as he looked upon her after all those years it was a reminder of how much he had grown too. She was a woman now though still seemed just as uncertain of herself he remembered her to be.  Aemond downed half of the milk his eye scanning her as he placed it back upon the tray he caught the way Sierra averted his bare body. As he settled back upon the Madam he rested his head right on her breasts taking in the comfort of her warm flesh.  As he did so Sylvie caught note of another worker peak her head through the silken curtains her eyes wide as if to signal there was trouble that needed to be attended to the Madam nodded and then caught the gaze of Sierra who approached the intruding brothel worker. Sylvie watched as the two young women were caught in a brief exchange and it seemed that Sierra had been passed a small note – which soon made its way into the free hand of the Madam.  Patron trouble. Girl left bloodied after a refusal of payment.  Sylvie then gave a nod to the waiting brothel worker sighing softly as she knew this would be no easy task. The known rule of Cock Inn was for no harm to befall her girls lest there be a tax placed upon any patron for the coin she would be unable to make in her recovery. Though it wasn’t uncommon for patrons to become… unruly with her girls and such behaviour was not tolerated at the Cock Inn as it was to be one of the finer establishments – meant for pleasure not outright degeneracy. For the most part the tax alone dissuaded most men from harming the workers though for the ones that did – it was an arduous task getting them to meet the agreement of the tax.  Aemond closed his eye when he felt the warmth of Sylvie’s hand come to his chin guiding his eye to meet hers.  “My prince…” Her voice soft cooing “It seems I must attend a rather urgent matter regarding one of the girls. I shall see to it that some of your coin is returned.” The Madam lowered her head shifting away from him as Aemond raised his brow in curiosity.  He sat up then extended back to lean upon the stone ledge “Hm I shall wait your return.”  The Madam shook her head rising up to her feet as she readjusted her robe “This particular matter shall not be easily solved I fear. I may not return for quite a time.”  Her head turned to meet the gaze of the waiting brothel worker she then found herself pondering upon Sierra. Who meekly awaited the Madam’s next instruction she cleared her throat before speaking to the prince once more “Very well then… please allow for Sierra to amuse you in the meantime. She is particularly popular amongst many noble men as yourself.”  He shook his head averting his gaze “I’ve no use for her in that manner.”  “Indeed…” A small smirk came upon Sylvie’s face she lowered her head raising her brow as she chuckled briefly “I mean for her to take my place… to satisfy such particular tastes of yours as you would have me?”  Aemond met Sylvie’s gaze almost like a boy stubbornly resisting his mother’s advice the Madam tilted her head moving over to Sierra who stood; wide eyed and unsure. The Madam gripped Sierra’s arm leading her closer to the bed “She is most gentle.”  His eye narrowed and Aemond took a deep breath in his chest raising in apprehension as he scanned the young woman before him. Her cherubic face slightly trembling demeanour. He gritted his teeth and nodded “Very well.”  With that Sylvie gave him a small nod of approval before gently grazing Sierra’s lower back as she left. As the older woman made her way through the drapes Sierra quickly followed; gripping her forearm softly causing the Madam to snap her head towards her. The young whore stuttered as she whispered meeting the concerned eyes of her mentor “Madam I…”  Sylvie sighed and brought Sierra closer whispering firmly “Just hold the boy. Do as you’ve seen me. Go girl.” She pulled herself way giving the other worker a subtle nod as she was led away.  Sierra turned taking a deep breath in to centre herself. She had never been with a man as powerful as the prince never known such fear which coursed through her at the thought of what might happened to her if she was to displease him. Her hear thumped as she took that fateful step back through the haze of silken drapes as she entered she felt the harsh gaze of that lonesome eye upon her scanning her.  Aemond sat up freely leaning back upon the stone ledge – uncaring that he was completely exposed before her. He let himself take her in her willowing form which held a peculiar softness to it. The roundness of her breasts and hips which clung to the silk robe draping her form – the familiar flicker of her flock of curls which had turned a rich gold with age a few bronzed and silvery strands peppered through them. He watched as her fingers delicately began to disrobe herself but her looked away. “Don’t.” The prince muttered.  As Sierra heard the smooth sound of his voice ring she froze slowly looking up to him as she thought how odd he was to refuse her bare. Instead he merely signalled awkwardly for her to join him upon the bed in which she obliged.  She sat carefully upon the end feeling the gaze of him boring into her back Sierra lowered her head “Do I displease you?” A soft tinge of her Lysene accent still lingering.  A small sigh left the prince as he shook his head and mumbled once more “No.”  “You… you wish for the Madam.” Her voice soft as she turned her head to look upon him.  “We share a history.” Aemond spoke plainly his eye narrowing as he gazed upon the young woman before him.  The soft flush to her cheeks her skin plump and face still retaining the kiss of girlhood upon it there was no mistaking the difference in her appearance to the Madam. He had noticed how despite the womanly graces Lady’s his own age possessed they hardly appeared as grown at all in comparison to the older counterparts. There was something distinctively different to a mature woman the way her cheeks sunk in a tad or her skin would be softened with lotions to mask the tautness that comes with age. How their voices are deeper and eyes brimming with confidence as if they know you all too well. In a way it was a comfort for Aemond to have a woman understand his desire – to have seen so many men before that harboured similar needs that for once he did not feel so different in his depravity. The Madam knew just how to sooth and ease him without judgement that so many younger women may possess. Indeed there was no mistaking how Sierra was likely no older than himself.  He suddenly spoke “What age are you?”  Instantly she felt her cheeks go red her voice soft girlish “Eight and Ten I believe.”  The prince raised his brow at this slightly shocked at her coyness. He had never seen a whore blush before it almost seemed like a jest “You believe? You do not know how old you are?”  She let out a gentle breath before shaking her head beginning to turn away before a sudden fierce grip clutched at her wrist. Seirra turned upon the bed her eyes wide.  “Do not look away. Speak.” Aemond commanded softly though a slight unease filled him at the sight of her uncertainty.  “I… I do not know of my name day?” She replied.  He tilted his head once again shocked by her flustered appearance and of course that she would not know of her name day. “You do not know?”  Sienna felt the soft satiny texture of the sheets below her her eyes drifting downwards as she spoke remembering her fractured girlhood “I was born in a pillow house… my prince. My mother perished but a few years into my youth I remember little.”  He bit his cheeks studying her “Hm and your father?”  The whore looked up her voice soft “A mystery.”  As Aemond continued to scan her he noted the way she altered herself in his presence – making herself appear small less intimidating. A strange amused look fell upon him as it found it both titillating and frustrating. He spoke sternly again changing the subject “Your accent…tis strange.”  “I am from Lys.” Sierra replied.  The prince hummed seemingly surprised “The Valerian freehold? You appear more like a Lannister than Lysene.” He watched her as he shrugged and he hummed again “Hm.”  The energy in the air was rife with tension not to mention a cloying awkwardness Sierra had seldom felt with other patrons. As though he was waiting for her to be the one to approach him and that he was.  Fed up with his inaction she moved closer to him noting the flicker of discomfort in his gaze – still the young whore pushed forward positioning herself beside him. Aemond gave her awkward glance before slowly sitting up looking out onto the lewd paintings on the chamber walls. He couldn’t help but feel a sudden nervousness he had never been with anyone but the Madam never touched a younger woman. He felt a vulnerability like none other his face hardening as he began to withdraw back into himself.  “My prince?” Her voice faltered exhaustion over the situation making her voice all the meeker she didn’t wish to pursue him if he was to be like this. It was too much she risked too much – the mere throughout of displeasing him and what he might do was enough to have her tense. But the mere fact it was he who seemed nervous he who seemed unsure of himself – made the matter all the worse.  She reached out attempting to draw him back her hand brushing his shoulder.  “Don’t.” Aemond shifted refusing to meet her gaze as he felt the touch of her fingers.  Another silence bloomed and Sierra moved back contemplating on what seemingly had set him off in such a manner. However the thought soon occurred to her that she had never once seen the prince with any other but the Madam recently that never once had she noticed or even heard of the King’s younger brother gracing the Street of Silk. It had only been that night all those years ago a slight pity bloomed as she understood he was likely uncertain of how to even engage with a woman of his own age so stifled by his own propriety “You have been with no other… haven’t you?”  Aemond did not respond to this of course only growing more angered and overwhelmed by the situation he found himself within. In fact he began to regret even returning to Sylvie he ought to have dealt with his feelings as a man would focus on the war on sharpening his mind and training his body. Readying himself to lead forces to take Harrenhal not simpering like a boy in the arms of a woman… not even just a woman… a whore in fact. His thoughts were broken by Sierra’s silvery voice “It would bring me much disgrace if I were unable to please you. The Madam would not have asked this of me if she did not think me… fit.. for you.”  Her words though seemed to tempt him once more and though he wished to resist it he also feared the idea of her finding him so weak to be unable to face both his desire and lack of experience. With a small puff of his chest and stretch of his neck he found his gaze hardening and mummering lowly “Move.”  The younger woman followed his command moving herself to the position in which Sylvie usually encompassed upon the bed Aemond turned his head gazing over her swiftly before he moved to lay upon her hesitantly. Sierra looked down her mind reeling as she had never seen a man behave in this way towards her… it was odd though not displeasing. Slowly she brought her hand to his silver locks gently threading through them attempting to mimic what she had seen Sylvie do upon him. As the prince laid his head upon her chest he felt himself unable to find the same kind of comfort as he usually did his eye remaining open the thought of giving in to such vulnerability in front of a woman such as she seemed unthinkable. He couldn’t relax shifting and readjusting himself endless and Sierra could sense as such as she cringed internally at the sheer gracelessness of it all.  As the prince finally settled upon her lap he had managed to find a semblance of relief from the tension that made him restless. It was the familiar softness of her thighs that same sweet and musky perfumed skin that it seemed all the whores the Madam included doused on their skin. Gradually he had managed to close his eye letting himself be taken by her hand making contact once more with his scalp.  “I… remember you.” She whispered.  Instantly his muscled stiffened at her words Aemond didn’t reply he only opened his eye.  “From all those years ago… and yet never again since.” Sierra whispered again her voice sweet and girlish as she looked down upon the gleam of his silver strands.  The prince cleared his throat quietly “Hm. I had no need to return.”  “And now?” She countered though the prince did not reply he closed his eye once more ignoring her and focusing on the soothing pleasure of her fingers against his scalp.  “You have only been with the Madam-” Sierra began again before being swiftly interrupted.  His head turned upwards slightly Aemond suddenly gripped her wrist forcing her hand from his hair as he snapped “I do not pay to have my intentions dissected freely.”  Sierra found herself suddenly stammering as she nodded fiercely feeling his grip loosen upon her wrist as she slowly brought it back to his hair. Aemond gave her a warning glare before turning his head back nestling his head further into her lap before he closed his eye. Silence bloomed… and awkward one at that.   As the prince lay there awaiting for her to further such affections upon him he huffed “You may do more.” He mumbled.  The young whore looked down upon him unsure of how exactly to approach furthering her touch nonetheless she lowered her head her head turning slowly to look up to her. Sierra cupped his jaw and forced herself closer straining her body slightly from the awkward positioning. Gently she let her lips kiss at his forehead and cheek her hands moving his face slightly awkward and soon the prince himself shifted his frame to a more accessible position. His head now once again resting upon her chest tilted upwards as she gazed upon his softly he noted the way her eyes flickered as they lingered upon his sapphire eye.  Sierra went to kiss him away but Aemond suddenly grew discomforted – feeling a particular sting of insecurity of his face. He had never been so close to a woman of his age. Never been touched by skin which was plump with youth. His jaw clenched as he pulled away slightly but the feeling of her cool hand came to his face once more drawing him near “You are unsure.” She read him.  “No.” Aemond replied firmly though it was a lie.  Sierra shook her head scanning him carefully “Do you not think I might know when a man might feel…tentative? You have not known the touch of others; I do not blame- “  “I am not some simpering boy who has not fucked a woman. Do not presume to know the reason behind my hesitation.” The prince snapped in response his temper flaring as her words struck a chord so exact it made him reel for he knew she was right. Knew that he had indeed never been with another but the Madam and even that had been a affair spurred on by recent events. The Madam felt easiest to approach easiest to reveal himself to. She had already seen him at his weakest frozen with fear and disgust as a young boy. Spurred on by the taunting of his brother. Who else was he supposed to turn to with such desires who else would give him comfort in the way he needed?  He stiffened attempting to regain the well curated mask of infallibility though he could not stifle that familiar nervous restlessness which dawned upon him again the wake of her silence.  Sierra let her gaze fall seemingly thinking on his words. Though she ignored them all together knowing they were merely the deflections of a young man who felt his ego wavering at the notion of his inexperience. The young whore looked up softly and before she could stop herself “I wish to show you.”  Prince Aemond merely blinked at her shocked by her sudden request. The two shared what felt like an eternity in stillness and like that he nodded no other words being exchanged.   Sierra almost couldn’t believe he had agreed so… easily? There was a small moment of uncertainty between them as their bodies shifted once more Aemond sitting upwards gazing at her expectantly as she disrobed herself. His eye couldn’t help but scan her tender form the peaks of her breasts the blooming swell of her soon to be developed hips; a young maid’s body – not yet enhanced by motherhood.  She settled back into her spot where he could coil upon her again and that he did. Her gaze lowered as she noted how his soft strands felt upon her bare skin. Slowly she brought his hand into hers guiding it to her breast letting him knead the soft flesh. Aemond found himself unable to fight against his desire carefully watching the way his fingers grazed the bud of her breast. A soft moan escaped her making him buzz with desire he did not resist when feeling her other hand guide his head closer he wet his lips before leaning in further to clasp them upon her nipple suckling softly.  The young whore let out a soft whimper moving his hand lower “You may please… a woman by touching her.” She guided his hand between her wet folds letting his fingers graze her clit.  The soft mewls which left her lips set off a fire in him the feeling of her wetness on his finger made him want to work to pleasure her more. His lips clasped her nipple harder his soft suckling intensifying as his fingers rubbed quickly inching to stick themselves inside her. Sierra grabbed his silver hair gently pulling him away her eyes meeting his lonesome one.  Aemond felt his cock stiffening greatly and slowly she let her hands come to his chest his body shifting as he cradled himself against her. Sierra found herself grasping at the length between him stroking it gentle to gauge his reaction – which was all but enamoured with pleasure as he shut his eye burying his head in the crook of her neck.  Her hand moved stroking at him feeling the softness of his skin in her palm – as she did so her lips peppered small kisses upon his forehead. Sierra was gentle with him despite the lewdness of the act – her touch and tenderness was a comfort the prince was indulging in. He raised his head up; a soft groan left him as he forced his lips into hers. For a moment he would pretend she weren’t just a whore but a woman who’s feelings were that of true care. As her hand increased its speed Aemond let out a low whimper into their kiss moving to force his lips on her neck.  Sierra tilted her head closing her eyes as she too found herself letting go to the heady feeling between them. He was much different than the usual man who might use her he seemed less interested in fucking her and more interested in being tended to. So that’s what she did; slowly Sierra pulled her hand from his length a soft muttering of protest leaving him.  “Lie back.” She whispered and Aemond obliged.  His eye was narrowed with need as he gazed upon her watching as her soft frame now hovered over his own. Slowly he raised a hand to her cheek feeling the smooth skin that flushed pink upon his touch. He watched her with a keen eye as she lowered herself down further settling between his legs. Aemond shuddered a breath his eye growing wide as he felt his heart thump wildly; suddenly he felt like a boy again – struck by an awkward inability to verbalise his desire. Though Sierra already knew as she lowered her head kissing softly upon his hip as her hand wrapped around his length once more.  The sight of her doing such a thing made him furrow his brow her lips pressing so gently into his taut muscle made him feel a tad unmanned; mainly because he enjoyed it. Aemond brought a hesitant hand to her hair deciding that he would indeed take control for once that if he were going to let a whore take him – he would attempt to assert his desire.  As his fingers laced his spindly fingers into her curls forcing her head lower until he felt her lips graze against his aching tip. “Take me.” He grumbled.  Her eyes looked up to his as her mouth came to clasp his tip swirling her tongue upon him; the fleshy yet salty taste that dripped from him filling her mouth. Aemond’s own mouth dropped his jaw slightly slack as his head tilted back he felt his fingers tightened their grip in her curls slowly moving her mouth to take more of him. The prince opened his eye looking down as a strange satisfaction brewed from the sight of it her mouth taking as much as he wished it to.  Another groan left him as she moved her lips up and down him gaining traction as the moments passed his hips now bucking – fucking himself into her mouth. He forced her head upon him faster and Sierra let him as she hollowed her cheeks – siphoning him to the point where his moans turned to pants. Her own sounds falling from her as she too felt a strange enjoyment from seeing him take so much pleasure.  He kept pushing his cock now an ache in which he needed relief from Aemond’s mouth hung once more as he mumbled “Faster.” To which the golden haired whore before him did so her hand now enveloped around the tail end of the base of his cock stroking it so that the orchis’ which hung between him were grazed – sending him into a further frenzy. Thoughts of wanting to push himself between her thighs filled him a fantasy of what she may feel like around him how her arms would wrap around him cradle him; it all made him huff. The pressure that built in him felt more than pleasurable it felt like a burning flame had been set off in his loins; at this point he could hardly care about the comfort Madam Sylvie brought him now all he could think of was how he longed to see his seed force its way into Sierra’s mouth.    Then a tinge of anger filled him frustration as his grip intensified as he fucked himself into her mouth – edging at his release. He felt like his brother depraved hungry with a force he had stifled for so long. But the thought of a whore striking such feelings in him suddenly left him feeling slightly conflicted almost angered by the sight of her bringing him such pleasure. Aemond’s hand tugged harshly upon her hair making her wince and she looked back confused by the sudden streak of aggression to which in her uncertainty she began to pull away.  “Keep going.” The prince choked out his voice low and soft… yet oddly threatening.  Aemond reeled at feeling small snaps of her curls break in his hand. Sierra slowly finding her mouth back upon him siphoning him as quickly as possible though she began to tremble slightly. Afterall this was no common patron she could not warn him of the brothel’s code of conduct – for he could very well burn the place to a fucking cinder or worse have their heads for an accused treason… or in an effort to purge Kings Landing of its sin. The Gods know it would not be the first time whores were blamed for the depravity of men’s desires.  It filled him with a familiar streak of satisfaction as he watched her buckle beneath him. Glory flooding him as the pleasure of her mouth brough him finally to his peak and the events of recent flashing through his mind as he rode out his long awaited release. That flash of fear upon his face reminded him of who he was and what he was capable of. Afterall even his uncle… The Rogue Prince himself had sought for him to be slayed in his sleep.    Daemon feared him his mother feared him his grandsire… the Blacks…and now the whore between him feared him. They should. He thought.  The sentiment lingered as he felt his peak slash through him spilling into Sierra’s now hot mouth. He looked down satisfied though disgruntled. He was quick to force her off of him interrupting her as she went to speak. It was clear Aemond did not wish to hear what she had to say.  Uncaringly he rose to his feet his cock still stiff and buzzing he reached to dress himself – feeling the soft unsure gaze of the whore who still sat upon the bed boring into his bare back. He ignored her unwilling to admit the pleasure he had brought her or the vulnerability that had been seen of him. It was gone just like that. Done away with.  As he felt himself calm a focus coming over him as the blood rushed from his length. Without another word he abandoned her sauntering through the Cock Inn the sounds of passing moans flooding his ears and perfumed air attacking his senses. Clarity. Is what he thought.  Clarity that he did not need to bury himself in a whore like his brother. He had greater control; he was indeed a man of finer stock. What need did he have to give in to not only a young woman… but a whore. Born so lowly she was conceived and birthed in a pillow house. No Aemond would take the pleasure and comfort he had gotten and focus his mind elsewhere.  At least until such desires demanded easing again.,2024-07-09 13:40:30 GMT

IT’S SUCH AN INTERESTING TURNING POINT FOR THOSE CHARACTERS.’  “House of the Dragon” Season 2 Episode 4 ramps up the Westeros civil war at Rook’s Rest during which Aemond made a shocking move that star Ewan Mitchell says will change things “forever.” Given the already fractured history between the brothers — which came to a head when Aemond put Aegon in his place in front of the small council earlier in Episode 4 — Mitchell said the Rook’s Rest sequence reflected the “two characters trajectories finally coming into an accumulation in the skies.” HOW HAS THEIR RELATIONSHIP CONTINUED TO DEVOLVE THIS SEASON WITH AEGON TAKING THE CROWN?  “I think Aemond’s in a very similar mind to where we saw him in Season 1 in that he still believes his brother is inferior to rule.” “Aegon was squandering his inheritance whilst he was in some sleazy corner in Flea Bottom whilst Aemond was in the Red Keep yard training with Criston Cole.” “Day in and day out he was studying with the masters; he was very much manufacturing himself into this weapon.” “Although Aemond is the second son he still very much believes that he should be treated as the first.” IN EP 4 WE SEE AEMOND VISIBLY TAKE POWER AWAY FROM AEGON AND PUT HIM IN HIS PLACE.WHAT DO YOU THINK SHIFTED WITHIN AEMOND THAT HE FELT THE CONFIDENCE TO DO SO?  “It’s an accumulation of two things — you get a sense of Aemond and Cole from the first episode that their intent is to manipulate the small council to their needs and what they want.” “I think they’re both in similar minds that they believe that war is inevitable and you can either wait for it to come to your doorstep or you can get ahead of the curve so Aemond and Cole wish to act.” “Then you couple that with Aegon’s history and Daemon’s history.” “He was the ringleader to a lot of Aemond’s childhood torment and bullying and that’s something that Aemond forgives but he does not forget — that’s probably always in the back of his mind as well.” “You ultimately see him exact that in Episode 4 especially during the council like “we have to act and I’m going to have to put you in the place if you’re not with me.” RIGHT BEFORE CRISTON COLE GETS THERE AEMOND HAS ALREADY FOUND AEGON BUT HE WAS IN THE POSITION TO CLICK HIS SWORD BACK. WHAT WAS HE ABOUT TO DO RIGHT BEFORE CRISTON FOUND HIM?  &quot;I think it’s ambiguous — that’s what I love.” “If I give all the answers people will stop asking the questions.” “I like that debate I like the theories that the fans strike up.” HOW DOES AEMOND FEEL ABOUT KILLING HIS GREAT AUNT? DOES AEMOND FEEL ANY QUALMS ABOUT THE MOVE? ARE YOU EXPECTING BACKLASH FROM FANS?  “If he feels any sort of regret it’s certainly something that he will never show he’ll get hidden behind that hardened facade that Aemond possesses.” “That’s one of the beautiful aspects of playing in the character you never truly know what Aemond is thinking in any given time.” “But you do know that he is thinking.” “He’s not just this mindless sociopath — the cogs are turning behind his eye.” “There’s a very very dangerous calculative quality to Aemond and he picks his moments.” AEMOND HAS A BIT OF A PATTERN WITH TAKING REVENGE WHEN HE SEES THE OPPORTUNITY. HOW INTENTIONAL WAS LUKE’S DEATH?  “Lucerys Velaryon bullied Aemond relentlessly along with his nephews and Aegon growing up.” “I think Aemond had forgiven Luke that he had taken his eye but he just hadn’t forgiven the fact that Luke got away with it.” “What could have been resolved with with simple words of apology was instead allowed to fester.” “Kids are going to be kids but it should have been the responsibility of the adults that the the kids find some sort of resolution and there wasn’t — there was no closure.” “That hatred for each other between two characters was allowed to build and build build.” “Ultimately what you see in the skies above Storm’s End is human nature taking its course.” “Aemond did not intentionally mean to hurt Luke he just wanted to scare him.” IS THERE ANY PART OF AEMOND THAT WISHES HIS AND AEGON’S RELATIONSHIP WAS ANYTHING LIKE JACE AND LUKE’S? OR WAS THE WAY THEY WERE RAISED — IN A LOVELESS JOYLESS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALICENT AND VISERYS VS RHAENYRA AND HARWIN — MEANT THEY HAD NO SHOT AT A REAL BOND?  “Aemond and Aegon growing up shared a world of hurt because they were the half of the family that weren’t seen to succeed the kingdom so Aegon and Aemond were kind of pushed aside they were neglected by Viserys.” “They never experienced that unconditional love from either Viserys or Alicent so maybe they don’t know how to show it as well certainly Aemond doesn’t necessarily know how to show it.” ’ALWAYS LIKEN AEGON AND AEMOND AS FREDO CORLEONE AND MICHAEL CORLEONE RESPECTIVELY.’  “Because Fredo should have looked out for Michael the same way that Aegon should have looked out for Aemond but instead Aegon went behind Aemond’s back and conspired against Aemond with the help of his nephews.” “Aemond does feel a hate to his enemies but when it’s your own brother that goes behind your back and backstabbed you that hatred is even deeper than someone who’s supposed to protect you and supposed to look out for you.”,2024-07-09 14:55:40 GMT

24,House of the Dragon,['interview with the vampire'  'iwtv'  'armand'  'game of thrones'  'got'  'hotd'  'meta'  'armand could never win the game of thrones i fear'],vanillabeanmachine,Having been watching “House of the Dragon” I’m drawn to the behavioral parallels between Armand and characters like Mysaria/White Worm and “Game of Thrones”’s Petyr Baelish and Lord Varys. These characters not only share backgrounds as sex workers and hold positions as Masters of Whispers but also exemplify a deep strategic cunning akin to Armand’s methods.  This connection is particularly striking I think when considering Petyr Baelish’s monologue in “Game of Thrones” Season 1 Episode 7 “You Win or You Die.” Baelish instructing his brothel employees stresses the importance of performance to eclipse the client’s recognition of reality: “You’re not fooling them they just paid you. They know it’s all just an act. Your job is to make them forget what they know.” He wraps up his tutorial by sharing a lesson from his own life that highlights his greater strategic philosophy: “Do you know what I learned losing that duel? I learned that I’ll never win not that way. That’s their game. Their rules. I’m not going to fight them I’m going to fuck them. That’s what I know. That’s what I am. And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.”  To reduce Armand’s manipulative tactics merely to trauma responses would I think simplify his character stripping away his complexity and agency. While his maneuvers are certainly shaped by past traumas to label them solely as trauma would not fully encompass the breadth of his motivations and strategic acumen. Armand embodies the master of seduction and guile skillfully leveraging these attributes to achieve his ultimate aims of security and stability. In this capacity Armand is not merely a victim of his circumstances but a proactive often underestimated strategist.  Both in literary canon and on the show Armand’s strategic manipulations eventually lead to his downfall. In the books his death comes at the hands of a lover spurred by jealousy—a consequence of Armand’s own manipulative schemes. Similarly in AMC “Interview With the Vampire” his manipulative tactics ultimately ruin his relationship with Louis.   There is a tragic irony here to Armand’s character: manipulation for survival leading to his destruction.,2024-07-09 14:42:09 GMT

Not to mention all the promo made it seem like Alicent and Rhaenyra were leading their sides their rivalry is supposed to be at the core of the dance. They were the two main characters in season one with Rhaenyra clearly being the shows protagonist that they want the audience to root for and yet they’ve done nothing but stall.

The egg was placed by his cradle the day he was born.   Aegon’s inability to speak fluent High Valyrian is probably mean to be a condemnation of his character. He’s not a fighter. He’s not a scholar. He’s not a tactician. He’s not a politician.  As we saw in season 1 he’s a rapist who is protected from the repercussions entirely by his social status.  He is also a bully and a drunk.  Not speaking High Valyrian is a minor character fault in my eyes. I tried it on Duolingo and it’s a difficult language. But it is part of a pattern for his character. How much of that is the fault of his parents and grandfather is a matter for debate.,2024-07-09 16:40:49 GMT

Aemond and the rest of the dragonriders literally give commands. That’s what they’re called. COMMANDS. SO THE DRAGONS CAN ACT OUT WHAT THEY WANT.   “Aemond couldn’t control her when she killed luke she’s evil.” Brother in christ. Luke’s death still gets me bless him but vhagar and arrax are wild predators on top of the food chain. They are quite literally wired with that killing trait.

20,House of the Dragon,['aegon ii targaryen'  'rhaenys targaryen'  'aemond targaryen'],onedayiwillfind-therightwords,I been wondering about this ever since we first saw Aegon with his armor: Why would dragon riders wear something made of metal to battle?   I mean it would make sense if they also intended to fight like any other soldier but dragon riders don’t really do that. They fight by using their dragons. And if you know there’s a chance to encounter an enemy dragon why wear armor?   Both Aegon and Rhaenys wore armor to battle. They said that Aegon’s armor belonged to the conqueror and was made of valyrian steel but he still got badly burned to the point the metal armor melted in some spots and surely it’s worse to be burned alive wearing metal than just normal clothes.   Which it’s what Aemond was wearing btw. Just normal clothes.,2024-07-09 18:41:27 GMT

HoTD opinion time here after the recent episode TORPEDOED my favourite character for no reason. (RIP Aemond you would have hated the writing in this ep.)  .  .  .  .  About the maiming of Aemonds face loss of his eye and Lucerys’s manslaughter. (It wasn’t murder it was an accident and it wasn’t a war casualty either.) And how it truly was what kicked off the war.    Luke didn’t hate Aemond he has no reason to hate Aemond. He was AFRAID of Aemond afraid of facing the fact that he had irreparably harmed someone that was dear to him (and he was dear to Luke we know that). Luke feared retribution AND accountability thats why he was scared.  He knew Aemond wanted revenge but he also knew that an apology would have gone a long way. They were family they had been friends once but Luke denied Aemond even an apology because he was too scared to accept that he’d done something necessary of such entreating.  Luke Jace Bela and Rhaena ganged up on Aemond wrongfully. It was WRONG fullstop. He defended himself and in a fit of adrenaline Luke made a decision out of anger and fear that destroyed a part of Aemonds PERSON. Then he was repeatedly denied closure for his maiming. Luke was spoonfed the lie that he’d done nothing wrong but he clearly knows thats not true but he STILL couldn’t bring himself to even say a simple “Im sorry.”   Accountability is hard and very scary sometimes it’s even scarier then the person you hurt. Admitting you did something monumentally shitty to a person can feel alot like admitting you’re a bad person even if thats not true.     I dont dislike Luke for doing what he believed was necessary to protect himself and his brother (and you shouldn’t either) I dislike everyone AROUND Luke for purposefully wedging themselves between him and Aemond denying BOTH OF THEM closure and the chance to move on and forgive each other and thus damning the rest of their family along with Luke and Aemond.,2024-07-09 19:44:32 GMT

The council could work to teach him to reppress those traits and then actually have a conversation with him. He wants to be an active ruler “I need to be informed of these things if I am to make informed rulings”. The issue is that he wasn’t put on that throne to rule or grow as a ruler. He was put on that throne to be a puppet for Alicent Otto and those men at the council.,2024-07-09 20:53:58 GMT

Where is sacrifice?” It is right here right now in Rhaenyra sacrificing her family as soldiers so she could be the Queen and fulfill the duty Viserys passed to her because of the prophecy. The crown demands its price in blood and she’s going to send her sons to the battlefield and lose them just like Viserys kept sending Aemma to the birthing bed that was a battlefield and losing his sons until he killed her too.

I had fun making this feel free to request any OC worlds/houses within the Game of Thrones universe! 💕   warnings - medieval style trans discrimination  Nossos // The Crescent World inspired by geography of Japan and a need for more asian inspo in this franchise  An ancient world so far from Westeros that the people rarely cross paths. Their history is traced back that it mixes factual events with mythical happenings unable to know what is history and what is fictional.   Before the empire of the dawn Nossos was a united land under the Emperor Caste. Much like Old Valyria there was no single ruler rather a caste of a few dozen families that claimed to be descendant of the volcanos and cracks in the earth. The lower castes were said to have crawled from the sea just like the water and ice dragons of the region.   Just like the lower castes the emperors bent the dragons to their will. The Emperors made slaves of all under their power competing amongst the royal houses to be the most feared and cruel.   That was to be their doom. The Long Night was not kind to the Emperor Caste their slaves rebelled and the dragons sided with the lands they were destined to protect. By the end of the long night the lands of the Crescent World was flooded scattering their lands into thousands of islands and the dragons retreated into the drivers and seas.  Those who survived the Great Flood changed their ways completely. The former noble houses became stewards of their land charged with keeping the peace amongst the working class who have flourished in the new age.  The noble houses take their traditions seriously the most important being The Pilgrimage. The first child of the noble family is the heir and is expected to marry into a powerful merchant family. All other children of noble families are sent on a great pilgrimage forced to give up their family names and commit their lives to the cause. They were expected to travel far from their homes to foreign lands and unknown nations. They are to give their lives to integrating themselves into societies until they are old and grey all for the glory of one day returning home to share their vast knowledge with their people.   The Maesters of Westeros only know of a handful of Nossos Pilgrims on the continent most if not all were currently living in Dorne away from their potential control. The Maesters were beyond excited when the Tyrells brought a Pilgrim to the Red Keep but were not expecting to be greeted by a young trans-woman and water dancing master who was willing to educate the ladies of court in the art of hands and swords. While the Maesters claim to be an agnostic order they could not look past the distain the Faith of the Seven instilled in them since birth.  Characters –  Tatsu trans woman // Dancing Master for Lady Ivyanne Tyrell — Pilgrim of Nossos  She was born second into a noble family knowing since birth that she was to be sent away. She felt guilty wishing ill on her elder sibling so that she could stay at home forever. But that day never came. She can barely remember her entire noble given name now. She was given all the tools she could wish for to prepare her for the long journey being educated at the feet of elders who had taken the pilgrimage before.   Newly named Tatsu traveled with a distant cousin and settled the first leg of their pilgrimage in the free city of Braavos. Tatsu threw themselves into the fighting style of the Braavosi masters sharing their own knowledge of the Nossos water dancing. So her journey began trading knowledge for skill. She hated herself every time she prayed to the Braavosi gods that she would one day hear word that she is needed to return home that her elder sibling was dead but word never came.   The Tyrell family visited the city with their young daughters offering gold and goods that weighted down multiple ships. Tatsu began her employment to the Tyrells against the wishes of her cousin claiming they were not trained to be servants. Tatsu enjoyed the taste of their wine.   Tatsu became close to the Lady Ivyanne a girl close to her own age with her own queerness that Tatsu helped nurture as they returned to Westeros together soon to move to the center of their seven kingdoms the Red Keep.  🏳️‍⚧️ fun fantasy trans fact – because Nossos is an ancient world I believe their magic/science/worldly knowledge is so advanced that Tatsu could be in any state of transition the reader wishes and it would make perfect worldly sense~,2024-07-09 20:33:16 GMT

You were one of Helaena’s ladies’ in waiting and only ever saw the then prince on occasion.  Then Aegon was crowned King and you saw him a bit more as Helaena was required to be present at what felt like too many ceremonies. Because you were almost exactly the same age although it was against an unspoken rule she came to see you as a friend.  When the twins were born and Helaena saw how good you were with them it seemed to anyone who was around that she wanted you near at all times. She practically begged you to begin sleeping in her chambers to help with the fussing and crying at night and of course you said yes. It occurred to you later that night that she could’ve just demanded it.   It wasn’t long at all before the twins also formed an attachment as their mothers need to have you close by didn’t lessen even as they got older.   Though they both loved you Jaehaerys in particular was very fond of you. Jaehaera was a lot more independent and chose to play with her dolls or little trinkets by herself. But the boy the other ladies’ in waiting and even Helaena herself often called him your little shadow.  Whatever task you were given it wasn’t uncommon for Jaehaerys to be nearby. As he grew a little older he began to ask questions.   Once he asked why his mother wore such fancy dresses but yours and the rest of the ladies’ were only ever plain. It hadn’t occurred to you that because you spent so much time with him and had a big hand in raising him he saw you as family and genuinely didn’t understand why you dressed differently.  Luckily you didn’t need to answer. Aegon appeared from around the corner calling for his son. Once Jaehaerys ran to him he gave you a nod before grabbing his sons hand and leading him in the opposite direction.  To the King you were a mystery. He knew his sister preferred you to the other ladies’ in waiting and he knew she’d rather you over any of them to be looking after the twins when she was busy but he didn’t know why. Still his sister was set in her ways and in the end he simply decided it was best to not ask questions. Even he could see that you cared deeply for his children and for him that was enough.  On the day Aegon wished for his son to sit in on a council meeting Jaehaerys was being a bit difficult that morning. For whatever reason he refused to go unless it was you that escorted him.  After assuring him that you’d only get the boy in the room and then quickly make your exit Aegon nodded and led the 2 of you into the room.   Just like you knew he would Jaehaerys immediately went for “the ball” as he called it in front of Tyland Lannister. You could see irritation immediately all over the man’s face but to his credit he did his best to hide it.  The third time the ball was grabbed you were the only one that heard it when Tyland snapped. The meeting hadn’t yet begun but you could see he already wished it to be over.  “That child doesn’t belong in here” he muttered to himself unaware that you could hear him.  “I will escort him to his mothers chambers now. Is the heir to the throne bothering you a bit too much?” That last bit slipped out and you immediately regretted it as the room grew silent and all eyes turned to the 3 of you. After a few tense seconds most everyone resumed their conversations.  You slowly stood up Jaehaerys now on your back as that was the only way he agreed to leave the room. “Apologies Ser Lan—”  “Hold on” the room stilled once again when it was Aegon that spoke this time. He looked at you then back at Tyland. “She has nothing to apologize for. And I believe she asked you a question. Is the heir to the throne my son is he bothering you?”  Even Alicent opted to look down and fiddle with her hands rather than step in. You didn’t think you’d ever been more grateful for Aegon that in that moment.  🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️  ONE. On the night Jaehaerys was murdered you were knocked unconscious. You’d later find out it was the man they called Blood that hurt you but at the time all you knew / remembered was waking to a loud noise. Immediately you got out of bed but before you could properly realize what was happening you felt something sharp across your cheek. And before you’d even had time to cry out something hard hit the side of your head causing everything to go dark.  When you woke you ignored the maesters requests to stay in bed. As soon as you stood up you almost wished you’d listened as you immediately felt dizzy. That was also when you felt the stinging pain of the cut on your cheek. The maester explained that you wouldn’t need to have it stitched up but he hadn’t yet bandaged you because even in your sleep you tossed and turn whenever he tried to tend to that injury.  After agreeing to not over exert yourself you were off to find Helaena. It was then that another one of the ladies’ in waiting broke the news to you.   When you were let in to Alicent’s chambers and locked eyes with Helaena she immediately stood up from her spot on the floor and ran to you Jaehaera still held tightly in her arms.   “Are you alright?” You knew she would be with the maester if she were injured but you still had to ask. “They said—”  “He’s dead” was all Helaena could say. That and “they killed him”.   What felt like an eternity later and you’d gotten Jaehaera to sleep and convinced Helaena to at least lay down with her you were unsure of what to do. Only a few moments later you found yourself wandering the halls. Every inch of the place had been searched almost immediately so you know that the halls were alright once again.  Part of you felt like you didn’t have a right to mourn Jaehaerys as he wasn’t actually your son. You were just trying to process the fact that you’d never see his little smile again. Never again would you turn a corner and be greeted with that sweet voice asking where the 2 of you were going because him staying with anyone else was out of the question.  You were one of the first to hold him after he was born and had seen him every day since. To already be in a world where he no longer existed it seemed cruel.  When you stopped walking you realized that you’d come to Aegon’s chambers. The doors were obviously closed and you had only managed to take a few steps back the way you came when you heard them open.  “Oh good” you turned around surprised that it was Alicent that had spoken. “Did Helaena send you?”  You stuttered as you tried to form a response but she seemed to take your silence as a confirmation.  “He’s distraught obviously. I’m not sure he’ll speak to you but…” she seemed unsure of herself. In the end she sort of motioned towards the doors before turning and walking away.  Before you even raised your hand to knock you heard sobbing. It was then that you realized you were wrong. Yes your heart could break even more.  It didn’t escape your notice that Alicent left the room as her son was sobbing. You knew she wasn’t the comforting type but you couldn’t imagine simply walking the other way.   After a few knocks you weren’t surprised when there was no answer. As you slowly opened the door then shut it behind you you thought to yourself that you should’ve thought about what to say beforehand. Here was this normally stone-faced man showing more emotion now than he had in the entire time you’d known him. And after more thought you realized that perhaps Alicent had tried to comfort him but was asked to leave.  “Who is there?” Aegon finally seemed to notice someone else’s presence but hadn’t actually looked up. His head remained in his hands and you could hear him trying to quiet his cries.  “I am sorry I— I just thought I should check on you.” You noticed how pathetic you sounded only after the words left your mouth.  He let out a humorless chuckle then slowly stood up and made his way towards you. “Check up on me?”  You nodded. “I just wanted to see how you were doing. Stupid question to ask if you’re okay I know.”  He studied your face for a moment and his guard came down ever so slightly. He believed your concern to be genuine. And for Gods sakes his own mother couldn’t even comfort him. She left quietly and Aegon knew it was in the hopes that he wouldn’t know she’d ever entered the room.  Still he couldn’t bring himself to answer you. Instead he returned to his sitting position once again leaning forward so that his head was in his hands.  “I should’ve been there” he spoke so softly that you didn’t quite hear him.  “Pardon?”  He looked up at you fresh tears in his eyes. “I should’ve been there!” When he saw how you flinched he regretted being so loud. But a larger part of him didn’t care. You were the first person to allow him to speak freely. He needed to let out his emotions somewhere. “I should have been there. But I thought who’d be stupid enough to try anything here? Look at how wrong I was.”  “There’s nothing you could’ve done” you shook your head.  “That is bullshit!” He stood up and began pacing back and forth. “My son is DEAD! It was an act of revenge why else do you think the rest of you were left alive?”  You were about to ask if they already know who is responsible but it’s as if he read your mind.  “My brother kills her son so she has taken it upon herself to exact revenge a son for a son!” He laughs but again there is no humor in his tone. “My son the heir to the throne he is gone. Murdered while he slept and I did nothing!”  As he sat crying you kneeled in front of him. Trying not to think about it too much you placed your hands on his and forced him to look at you.  “Everyone around knows how much you love that boy. And he loved you just as much.” You decided it was better to not repeat that he couldn’t have done anything. Right now in front of you was a father who needed to grieve.   Aegon knew he should be cautious. His sister knew you well but he did not. He was already ashamed that you’ve seen him cry. Yet you didn’t seem repulsed. You allowed him to rant and didn’t try to shove advice down his throat. His son was gone but you reminded him of the love that existed that still exists.   The angry part of him wanted to shout at you to leave but he couldn’t bring himself to yell again in that moment. So he allowed your hands to remain on his as he cried for his son.   You prayed that no one would walk in as you stood up and pulled Aegon up with you. Before he could ask what was happening you gave him a hug.   His first instinct was again one of anger. He resisted the brief urge to push you away. After a few seconds he even surprised himself when he almost melted into your touch. He genuinely couldn’t remember the last time he was in someone else’s embrace like this. And you didn’t ask questions. You only held him and listened to his heartbeat.   He found himself crying again as he returned the gesture and wrapped his arms around you. Although he knew he could never speak of this and he’d have to ask that you not do the same at some point he allowed himself to do nothing but mourn the loss of his son as you held him in your arms and you in his.   He was grateful that at least in this moment you allowed him to grieve.   🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️🗡️  TWO. After that there was a noticeable change. Aegon gravitated towards you if he entered a room and you were already there. Everyone noticed but none dared to speak on the matter not even Alicent or Otto.  You heard about the meeting in which it was ultimately decided that Jaehaerys’ body would be placed on a carriage led through the streets so that the public might see just what Queen Rhaenyra was capable of. You didn’t think this was her doing. How could a mother who has just lost her son inflict that pain onto someone else? Surely she wouldn’t. But everyone else was so sure. And you were but a low-born lady in waiting so you remained silent.  The thought of Jaehaerys being used paraded through the streets for all to gawk at it angered you. Yes he was a prince. And you understood the message that they hoped it would send but it didn’t make you any less upset. He was just a boy. You thought of the boy who would run into your embrace whenever you walked in to his mothers chambers.   You couldn’t even imagine how Aegon was feeling. He loved that boy deeply and you had no doubt that he was pressured into agreeing.  That same night you were abruptly woken up. Immediately you looked to Helaena’s bed filled with relief to see her and Jaehaera fast asleep. But it alarmed you that it was Ser Criston Cole of all people who’d woken you up.   He put a finger to his lips then turned and exited the room. You made sure you looked at least half decent before you followed him wondering what on earth possessed him to wake you at such an hour.  “I—” He looked unsure of where to start.  “Has something happened?”  “It’s the King.” He didn’t wait for you to respond instead turning and practically running out of the room.  As you chased after him it did occur to you that it was odd for him to fetch the King’s sisters ladies’ in waiting. You also realized that he never technically responded when you asked if something happened.   When the 2 of you finally reached Aegon’s chambers Criston didn’t even open the door. He didn’t need to though you could hear the shouting and loud noises from outside.  “Who else is in there?” You fiddled with your hands unsure of what you were walking into.  Criston merely shook his head. “No one. He kicked everyone out. But I know you helped him that— that night. Can you…?”  Without giving it a second thought you nodded. Instead of leaving Criston sort of stood guard right outside the door. You’d seen Aegon angry before and were secretly relieved that he was outside should anything go wrong.  This time you didn’t bother knocking. You did however try to open and then close the door as quietly as possible.  “I declare war!” It was the first thing you heard since entering the room and you didn’t bother asking who he was declaring war on.  “My King —”  It was as if he was in a sort of angry trance. You speaking didn’t even cause him to look in your direction.  “I want them all dead! They’ll all pay for this every fucking one of them!” As he spoke he moved about the room destroying King Viserys’ carefully and meticulously constructed display.  You could see he needed to let his anger out. And didn’t exactly want to approach him while he held something that could hurt you. Not that he intentionally would but seeing as he had no reaction to you calling out to him you didn’t think it wise to sneak up on him.  As the smashing and destruction went on you could see Aegon begin to wear himself out. It wasn’t so much that the anger was leaving his body but rather that he was losing the energy to continue. Now you thought to yourself was a good time to gauge where he’s at mentally / emotionally.  “My King—” you tried again. This would be a moment you’d come to regret seeing as you hadn’t considered the fact that Aegon was so blinded by his rage that he hadn’t noticed it was you in the room. Sure he heard the doors open and close but he assumed it had been one of his men.  Not registering who it was that just spoke and only hearing that someone was interrupting his rampage he turned around with an arm swung out. It ended up being sort of a backhanded slap and unfortunately he was wearing a ring.  Once he realized it was you that he’d just harmed Aegon froze. His eyes widened and he immediately dropped to his knees.   “Are you hurt? Did I— did I…” He didn’t seem to know what he wanted to ask.  You put a hand to your cheek and examined your fingers nothing a small amount of blood. He hit almost exactly where you were cut and by the feel of it you guessed that his hit reopened the wound.   “It’s fine” you tried to reassure him. “I am sure I will be healed in no time. There is no need—” Before you could finish speaking he’d fled from the room but not before hurriedly asking you to stay put.  Only a short while later he returned with the maester quickly following behind him.   As the man tended to your face you could practically see the gears turning in his head as he debated on speaking. In the end he decided to ask the question.  “How did you manage to reopen this wound?”  Luckily for you you’d studied the room and had your answer prepared.   You pointed to a spot on the floor where a glass of wine lay spilt. “I slipped just there. Tried to steady myself and ended up landing on my face and cutting it with one of the broken pieces.”  Because you spoke immediately and with such confidence your lie was believed.  “Might not heal as well if it’s opened a third time. Still doesn’t need stitches just try not to fall again eh?” He gave you a pat on the shoulder before giving you a small jar of ointment to apply to the cut instructing you to apply it once a day.  As soon as the man left the room you studied Aegon. He was pacing the entire time only stopping once the maester had left.   “Why?” He whispered.  You knew what he was asking. “I did not think it would do any good for him to know the truth. I know you didn’t mean to” you shrugged.   He was almost in a state of shock. Here he’d just injured you accidentally sure but it was still done in anger. And it wasn’t that long ago that he broke down in front of you. Despite all of that you were still kind to him. You covered for him.   Aegon fell to his knees once again in front of a large portion of the mess he created. “I’m sorry” he spoke softly.  “My King you do not need to apologize. As I said I know it wasn’t on purpose.”  He looked up at you fresh tears in his eyes and you lost count on how many times your heart broke for him. You joined him on the floor and put what you hoped was a comforting hand on his shoulder.  “I can’t do anything right” the first tear fell but he didn’t bother wiping it away. “I allowed men to break in and murder my son and this is twice now you’re hurt because of me.”  The fact that he blamed himself for it still brought tears to your eyes as well.  “No one thinks this was your doing and I swear to you that I don’t blame you.”  He was silent for a moment deep in thought. “How am I meant to continue?”   His question caught you off guard. “Pardon?”  “My son is dead. Murdered and my dear sister that claims to be the rightful heir may not have held the knife but I know she commanded the men that did. How am I supposed to to sit on the throne and continue to rule as if none of this has happened?”  “I do not think anyone expects you to act as if nothing has happened —”  Hearing that caused Aegon to laugh. “Have you met my mother? She is one of the many against me declaring war.”  “This tragedy —”  He cuts you off once again. “Tragedy? Hah! Understatement of the fucking year. And people are already speaking about my sons murder as if it’s a lesson! My grandfather dear old Otto Hightower wants to parade my sons body for all to see. Says it will show them the kind of Queen that Rhaenyra really is. You should’ve seen how many nodded their heads in agreement. How do I just hand him over to be stared at as if he is no more than a piece of meat on display at the market?”   “I hate this” you finally get a chance to speak. “Jaehaerys was the sweetest little boy I kno—knew. And I wish his death wasn’t being used in this way. A tragedy should not always be a lesson. Sometimes it should be allowed to be just that a tragedy. I am truly sorry you are having to deal with all of this.”  Something about what you’ve said causes tears to spring to Aegon’s eyes. Perhaps it’s the way you speak so kindly of his son. He knows you genuinely loved the boy after all. “I’m sorry I’m sorry…” His quiet sobs begin as he echoes your use of those 2 words and when you turned to face him he practically falls into your embrace. You stop counting how many times he utters I’m sorry. In between the I’m sorry’s he mostly said his sons name but you heard your name as well as Helaena and Jaehaera’s.   Night turned into morning and Aegon finds himself in your arms once again. Eventually his sobs had slowed down and he fell asleep laying on the hard floor with his head in your lap.   As he slept you allowed yourself to run your hands through his hair just for a moment. Aegon let out a content sigh finding comfort in your movements even in his sleep.  Here was this boy who was feared by many who didn’t ever want anyone to see him as weak and yet twice he allowed himself to cry and grieve in front of you.   At some point you gently wake Aegon and convince him to get into bed.  As you take one last look at him before exiting his chambers you can’t help but silently hope that the future would be a little kinder to him.

THAT EPISODE IS GOING TO SATISFY SOME DRAGON-HUNGRY FANS. RHAENYS CERTAINLY MET HER DEMISE BUT AEGON’S FATE WAS LEFT A LITTLE MORE VAGUE.  “It’s a seismic event that’s changed the future going forward with these characters.” “Aegon’s fate remains unknown.” “I don’t want to spoil anything for anyone.” “But going into episode five you are going to see the fallout of Rook’s Rest which I can’t wait for people to see.” “It’s a massive blow for Team Black.” “The line in the sand has been drawn and Aemond just crossed that line.” “And there’s no going back. I’m sure there will be retaliation.” WHAT ARE AEMOND’S TRUE MOTIVATIONS IN THIS WAR? IF NOT LOYALTY WHAT IS IT THAT’S DRIVING HIM?  “I think there are many things that are driving him but one of them that I loved to play with and explore was this idea that he wants his mum.” “Every time I shared a scene with Olivia Cooke around the council table every time I looked at Alicent Hightower I very much imagined Aemond and Alicent sitting on a Dornish beach far from war sipping on piña coladas …” “Aemond having become the war hero and managing to make his mum happy in his eye so to speak.” “Whether or not that’s Alicent’s version of happiness is another thing.” “But that’s how Aemond sees it. So I think that’s one of his is driving motivations.” “Also what Alicent does in episode seven of season one that’s something that Aemond doesn’t forget.” “When they’re all arguing about where Aemond had heard this illegitimate child of Harwin Strong rumor from Alicent went back to the idea that this kid had been physically damaged and changed for life.” “She was the only voice that was backing him up in that moment.” WHO DOES AEMOND BELIEVE BELONGS ON THE IRON THRONE?  “You don’t necessarily know what is going on behind Aemond’s eye.” “He’s a very calculative person.” “He’s not just your one-dimensional black cat and mindless sociopath kind of character.” “He is thinking at all times.” “You see that in the first four episodes — in so much of them he operates from the peripheries.” “But does he even want the throne? (Shrugs)” HAS HE FALLEN VICTIM TO THE “HEIR AND THE SPARE” RESENTMENT LIKE DAEMON?  “He feels that Aegon lacks the perseverance to be king.” “Aegon says it himself: He has no wish to rule.” “Whereas Aemond he’s been studying with the masters.” “He’s been training with the sword so he very much feels like he would make a worthier king whether or not that’s what Aemond wants.” DOES DAEMON SEE HIMSELF IN AEMOND?  “That’s a good question.” “I don’t know if I could answer it.” “Maybe it’s one for Matt Smith who plays Daemon” “But I think a part of Aemond would wish that Daemon saw Aemond in himself.” “There’s so much of his image that lends itself to that idea that Aemond is very much paying homage to a young Daemon Targaryen with the Targaryen black and the long hair.” “It’s very reminiscent of the rogue prince. Aemond being Daemon’s biggest stan he would definitely want to live in Daemon’s head rent-free.” DO YOU THINK SEEING AEMOND IN A MORE VULNERABLE LIGHT SOMEHOW MAKES HIM MORE FRIGHTENING? IT’S LIKE THE PERSONAL VENDETTA — WHETHER IT’S AGAINST HIS BROTHER AEGON RHAENYRA OR ANYONE ELSE — BECOMES A LITTLE SHARPER.  “I very much wanted to portray the image of someone who had manufactured their body into a lethal weapon.” “This kid doesn’t need armor. He doesn’t need to be brandishing a Valyrian steel sword to appear like he could ultimately end those characters’ lives in those moments.” “There’s something powerful in that regard. Me and Geeta Patel we always talked about the possibility up to that scene of maybe Aemond wrapping a blanket around himself as he was leaving or maybe using his hands to cover himself as he was leaving.” “But we were very-like minded in the respect that this is a character who does not care what you think about him.” “And that carelessness it’s quite scary.” “Talking about that code coming into place he cannot be seen as weak at all costs.” “Love in Aemond’s world is seen as a weakness.” “And so he has to put duty above that.” “He puts strength above that.” WOULD AEMOND BE IN THE SAME DANGER THAT HE IS WITHOUT VHAGAR?  “Probably not.” “He recognizes that he’s a young man who possesses a power that no one else has in Vhagar.” “He can do things that no one else can do and she very much shapes the dynamic of any room that he walks into.” “He doesn’t need to be anything because her shadow looms so large behind him.” “And so if he’s being threatening it’s not because he needs to be — it’s because he wants to be.” IS IT WEIRD TO SEE SO MANY FANS CRUSHINT ON YOUR CHARACTER? THEY HAVE BEEN DEBATING WHO IS MORE ‘BABYGIRL’: DAEMON OR AEMOND.  “I haven’t got social media so I don’t see it. But one of the results of not having social media is that it produces these beautiful badass fun letters from people from all across the globe.” “To read that I take it all as motivation whether we’ve had a good reaction or a negative reaction.” “I never take it for granted.” “But is Aemond babygirl? I don’t know.” “It’s a dilemma. What’s the definition of a babygirl?” I THINK IT’S AN ATTRACTIVE CHARACTER THAT PEOPLE TAKE PITY ON A LITTLE BIT. SENSIBLE A BIT VULNERABLE. MAYBE THEY THINK HIS HEART’S IN THE RIGHT PLACE.  “Like maybe there is good underneath it all.” “I’ll take the compliment.” WHAT’S TO COME FROM AEMOND THIS SEASON?  “I don’t want to spoil it but it’s going to be good.” WOULD YOU SWITCH TO TEAM BLACK?  “No no — I’d want to stay on Team Green.” WHAT’S TO COME FROM EWAN MITCHELL? HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING IN THE PIPELINE THAT YOU’RE EXCITED ABOUT?  “Nothing is set in stone yet.” “I’m down to the last few for something that I really want and I’m not going to say what it is because as soon as I do I won’t get it.” “I’m up for any challenge any character.” “I love horror horror is definitely a genre I’d love to venture into.”,2024-07-09 21:37:52 GMT

That’s like saying “German shepherds respond best to german”   Maybe you can argue that’s what those dragon pit guys teach the dragons but then you know they switched to common when training with at least Aegon.   Also of aegon and sunfyre were supposed to have a strong bond and dragons are soo sensitive to language then they had to have been able to communicate in a shared language.,2024-07-09 21:28:41 GMT

Warnings - mentions of blood mentions of fighting no real plot hurt/comfort subtle rivals-to-lovers aeron grabbing boobies lmao maybe some grammar errors idk  Word Count - 1.6k !MINORS DNI!  // masterlist // send me your thoughts // comments &amp; reblogs appreciated! //  As the sun dips below the horizon the beginnings of dusk paint the land around you in dim muted hues. The forest buzzes with life—crickets chirp and frogs croak rodents scurry through the undergrowth as birds-of-prey call out overhead.   Unlike the nocturnal creatures around you you take great care to stay quiet fearing that if you don’t the very soil beneath your boots might finally recognize you as an intruder.   So you keep every footfall careful and deliberate; avoiding sticks and leaves in favor of plush noiseless grass. Even your breaths are calculated soft as the spring breeze rustling the leaves overhead.   After all you’re playing a dangerous game venturing this far from home. To be several miles from the vastness of Blackwood Vale traipsing on the wrong side of the boundary stones no less… You were gambling with your life—fair game for any Bracken man wishing to bloody their sword with Blackwood blood. As the daughter of Lord Samwell Blackwood you would make a fine prize too.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; But you had grown comfortable in these woods the past several months. Familiar too—learning which paths were best avoided and which clearings were most often used for hunting or goofing-off. You learned to remain invisible weaving through the trees like a wraith—invisible unseen and unheard as you drift towards your usual meeting spot.   Well—mostly invisible you suppose.   You’re less than a few feet from your spot—a glistening creek branching off from the Red Fork several miles off any main trail—when a twig snaps! behind you.   Your spine turns to steel every muscle locking up as alarm bells roar in your mind. A second too late you reach for the dagger at your thigh. Trembling fingers hardly graze the hilt before an arm wraps itself around your waist tugging you backwards into a crushing embrace.   A single finger jabs at your chest just off-center between your breasts pressing through the thin fabric of your tunic.   Just above your heart you realize as it hammers against your ribs.   “Got you.” Aeron’s voice quells your nerves warmth tickling your skin as he nuzzles his face into the side of your neck. “If I were anyone else” he murmurs “you would be dead right now.”   He taps his finger against your chest—once then twice—to emphasize his point. As much as it annoys you you know that he’s right. Anyone else and they wouldn’t have hesitated to send a blade tearing through your chest.   You won’t admit it though.   “You scared me” you grumble instead trying to sound annoyed with him. It’s a hopeless objective—it’s too hard to be upset with him when his lips brush over your still-racing pulse kissing up your neck.   “Did I?” Aeron asks playing coy. “Strange. I thought you Blackwoods claimed to be fearless.”   Teeth graze against your earlobe nibbling lightly. You bite your lip twisting around in his hold so that you’re face-to-face. “And I thought Brackens were all insipid creatures” you tease him. “So I suppose we both deviate from the norm of our Houses don’t we?”   Aeron laughs—a sound so sweet it makes your teeth ache. “I suppose so.”   He pulls you closer hands falling low on your hips. In all your life you’ve never met someone so warm before—the sheer closeness of your bodies like standing too close to the edge of a fire. It sets your every nerve ablaze desire coiling in your belly like a fiery serpent.   He presses his forehead to yours and for a moment you assume he’s going to kiss you.   Instead your breaths only mingle in the space between you his lips barely grazing yours as he whispers “Still—I need you to be more careful. Especially here.”   Here.   That one word is like a bucket of water dousing the flames lapping at your skin. Desire swiftly turns to nausea at the realization that even in the arms of your beloved you were still unwelcome in this part of the Riverlands. Still an intruder.   You step back Aeron’s hands falling from your hips. “As if you’re one to lecture me about being careful.”   Neatly-groomed brows knit together as he watches you turn your back abandoning him in favor of the gurgling creek. Confusion laces his words as he hurries after you. “What is that supposed to mean?”   “That Benji has a big mouth.” You sit in your usual spot by the creek’s edge your legs stretched out in front of you. You look up at Aeron with a raised brow. “Did you truly think he wouldn’t tell me about you insulting him this morning?”   “He was trespassing on Bracken land” Aeron argues.   You give him a flat look that screams: As if you’re one to talk.   Aeron had snuck onto Blackwood land more times than you could count—with far more nefarious intentions than Benji. If your brother ever found out about all the times Aeron had snuck into your bedchambers at Raventree…   “Well he also called me a spineless dolt” Aeron grumbles. His lips naturally flushed and oh-so-kissable turn to a sullen pout. “What was I supposed to do? Just stand there and take it?”   You fight the urge to scream Yes! at the top of your lungs.   Instead you draw in a breath. “You know better than to get into it with him Aeron. You said it yourself: Blackwoods are fearless—especially Benji.”   He shakes his head strands of sandy-colored hair brushing his shoulders. “Feckless is more like it.”   “Tread lightly Bracken.” You bristle shooting him a look of warning. “He’s still my brother.”   He doesn’t apologize—and you don’t expect him to. After all both of you know that there’s some truth to his words.   Benji has always been… difficult.   Quick to anger and slow to forgive he was one of many reasons why you kept your feelings for Aeron hidden.   Your father could be persuaded to accept such a betrothal you think. After all it was common—if a bit futile—for Blackwoods and Brackens to wed in the name of peace. At the very least for the sake of your happiness he would consider it.   But Benji…   “I know I cannot expect you to just let him walk all over you” you tell Aeron a bit softer now. “But you know how Benji is.” You turn to the water by your feet. It ebbs and churns bubbling as it laps at the stones lining the edge. “How detached he gets.”   It petrifies you sometimes. How in a fight Benji becomes someone else entirely. Should he ever decide to do more than simply taunt Aeron you know without doubt which of them would survive such a fight.   “If the two of you ever… If Benji hurts you–”   Tears sting the back of your throat the heavy words clinging to your tongue like molasses. You don’t want to think about that—but you can’t stop either. Silver lines your eyes tears threatening to spill over as Aeron drops to the ground beside you.   Without hesitation he tells you “You’re right.” Soft uncalloused hands gently cup your face urging you to look at him. He brushes a thumb along the apple of your cheek. “I was careless—to think only of my pride instead of what it might do to you if your brother…” Aeron pauses thinking. “If he went too far. For you I’ll take better care to hold my tongue around him.”   Your voice is quiet hardly perceptible over the gurgling water when you say “Do you promise?”   A childish thing to ask perhaps.   Yet Aeron obliges without question.   “I swear it on the Gods.”   Slowly relief begins to untangle the knot in your stomach.   “But” Aeron’s lips quirk into a small teasing smile “only if you swear to be more cautious when coming here. It seems you’ve gotten far too comfortable wandering through Bracken territory.” A bit more solemn he adds “You should walk with your dagger out at the ready just in case—at least while you’re still a Blackwood.”   A wrinkle forms between your brow. “While I’m still a Blackwood?” You ask amusement dancing in your tone as you echo his earlier words “What is that supposed to mean?”   “That you won’t be a Blackwood forever—eventually your father will have to marry you off” Aeron drones his hands falling from your face to your waist. “Such is the natural order of things.”   You try not to giggle as he starts pawing at you pulling you onto his lap your thighs caging his hips. “True—but I had no idea you spent so much time thinking of my future.”   Aeron’s hands dip lower moving from your waist to slip beneath the hem of your tunic. “I’m always thinking of you.”   “Have you any particular House in mind then?” Brushing a lock of sandy hair from his face you jest “I can pass your suggestions along to my father.”   Fingertips trace along your ribcage inching higher and higher. His palms graze your breasts and suddenly breathing becomes a difficult task—the warmth of his touch reigniting the familiar spark in your belly.   “Well—” he leans in close smooth lips hovering over yours—“I’m quite partial to how you might look in gold.”   “Careful” you warn—though it’s interrupted by a hiss as he toys with your nipples rolling and pinching grinning at your reaction. “That almost sounds like a proposal Bracken.”   Aeron nearly moans into your mouth as your thighs tense rolling your hips against his his voice gruff as he asks “And would that be such a horrible thing?”   He doesn’t wait for your answer. Doesn’t want it maybe.   Instead he catches your lips with his. You melt into it—his touch his taste. His tongue glides against yours your fingers tangling in his hair and—for a moment—you let everything else fall away your fears and worries fading into insignificance.   No you think. That wouldn’t be horrible at all.  a/n - so I actually ended up not liking this at all once I got about halfway through editing—honestly something about the ending just is not vibing for me and there really just isn’t any true plot here lol. but with that being said I had already written it so I decided to go ahead and post it because there needs to be more aeron/amos bracken content in the world. and yes I did totally just use the name aeron because I like it more than the name amos lmao.   anyways hope you got some sort of enjoyment out of this! time for me to go write more benji fics🫡,2024-07-09 22:51:55 GMT

I “- He is the basest of villains. He sullies the grave of his brother. (Jacaerys Velaryon) - I cannot fault him for keeping his oath. (Rhaenyra) - Otto Hightower would never have allowed this. Hotter blood has prevailed I think. The young men have taken the bit in their teeth. They wish to punish to avenge. Soon they will not even remember what it was that began the war in the first place. (Rhaenys) - That is easy enough. They usurped my throne. (Rhaenyra) - That is one answer. Or was it when the child was beheaded? Or when Aemond killed Luke… or when Luke took Aemond’s eye? We teeter now at the point where none of it will matter. And the desire to kill and burn takes hold and reason is forgotten. There may be another way. Alicent Hightower. (Rhaenys) - When last we met Alicent said I would make a fine queen. You’ve seen what has happened since then. (Rhaenyra) - There is no war so hateful to the gods as a war between kin. And no war so bloody as a war between dragons. (Rhaenys) - What she did… (Rhaenyra) - It is not her but the men around her who seek bloodshed. (Rhaenys) - She permitted it. (Rhaenyra) - As you permitted the murder of a little boy in his bed.” (Rhaenys)  “- You’ve appointed new knights to the Kingsguard Your Grace. (Ser Criston) - To replace those we lost. The last one needlessly some might say. (Aegon II) - Ser Arryk was awarded the great duty of ending Rhaenyra’s challenge. He failed to discharge it. (Ser Criston) - He failed because the scheme was rash. (Alicent) - Perhaps Your Grace but we cannot all hide in our castles waiting for war to come to us. (Ser Criston) - As now it surely will. (Alicent) - As now it already has. House Bracken took it upon themselves to attack the Backwoods who declared for the pretender. Lord Samwell Blackwood himself is slain. (Aemond)  - Good. First blood in our name. (Aegon II) - Both sides took heavy losses Your Grace. I’m not entirely certain we can declare this a victory. (Tyland Lannister)  - The Blackwoods and the Brackens have feuded for centuries. This is nothing more than an excuse for them to indulge their ancient grudge. It’s no true war. (Jasper Wylde) - Call it what you will… I call it war. And so will Dragonstone. (Aegon II) - The question is what are we going to do about it? (Alicent) - We send a raven to Lord Tully. (Grand Maester Orwyle) - These houses are his vassals are they not? He must control them. (Alicent) - Lord Grover Tully is a flaccid old fool who couldn’t control his cock in a cunny. Begging your pardon Your Grace. (Jasper Wylde) - Do you have any better suggestions Lord Jasper? (Aegon) - This council must rediscover the discipline it lately had if it’s to be of any use. (Alicent) - We will add their numbers to our own and then turn west. Where I will enlist the Brackens subdue the Riverlands and take Harrenhal. (Ser Criston) - That is precisely why you must remain brother. It’s a brave thought but we cannot risk your loss. (Aemond) - I’m as fearsome as any of them.” (Aegon II)  “- You saved my life. What is the life of a queen worth these days? (Mysaria) - Hm you wish to be rewarded. (Rhaenyra) - As I would think you would wish to reward me. (Mysaria) - What price would you set? (Rhaenyra) - A place at your court. (Mysaria) - You said your earnest desire was to flee Westeros. (Rhaenyra) - And you let me go. You showed me grace when you could have withheld it. I’m not often surprised. (Mysaria) - One turn for another then. (Rhaenyra) - I know the workings of the Red Keep and the movements of those who serve there. That is worth more than gold to you now. (Mysaria) - And what is my worth to you? (Rhaenyra) - I would punish the Hightowers for what they have done. To me… to those who served me. But more than that I know the struggles of the smallfolk of King’s Landing. They will be ruled either by you or by the usurper. And only one of you has shown yourself to be merciful. (Mysaria) - Well I hope you do not confuse mercy with pliancy. (Rhaenyra) - Are they always like this? (Mysaria) - Seasmoke my late lord husband’s dragon. He’s grown restless of late. We cannot know why. (Rhaenyra) - Maybe he’s lonely.” (Mysaria)  “- You must take the little ones further. To Pentos I think. (Rhaenyra) - Where my mother died. (Rhaena) - It is safer than anywhere in Westeros. Write to Prince Reggio. If he will have you then go to him. I am sorry to put this upon you. It breaks my heart to send my boys away not knowing when I will see them again. But you have seen what may befall them here I need you to be the mother to them that I cannot. Teach them train them guard them as a dragon guards her eggs.” (Rhaenyra)  “- I’ve survived many a battle. I do not mean to be felled by poisoned peas. (Daemon) - I’ll admit that my cock’s peas aren’t exactly the stuff of legend but poison? (Simon Strong) - Well it’s an easy way to kill a dragonrider. (Daemon) - If you’ve not yet surmised you are welcome here. (Simon) - And what of your lord Larys Strong hm? He who sits at the false court of Aegon? (Daemon) - Larys Clubfoot is no lord of mine. He is a scourge upon this castle and this family. Do you not think it’s strange that his father…. my nephew Lord Lyonel perished by fire? And his son too here in this damp place? It was the first fire here since Balerion ended the line of Harren the Black. Even in the summer we struggle to light the hearths. So no you will find no loyalty to Larys Strong here my prince. (Simon) - Your Grace. (Daemon) - Forgive me. Um.. I’d only assumed that as consort… (Simon) - Then we are reminded of the perilousness of assumption. (Daemon)  - Indeed. Your grace. (Daemon) - Harrenhal is the largest castle in the Seven Kingdoms. Or perhaps that has escaped your attention. (Daemon) - But it is also not to be argumentative in something of a state of disrepair since your forbear incinerated much of it with his dragon. (Simon)  - Well that is precisely why we must bring it into a state of repair. (Daemon)  - Even if we possessed the coin my prince… Your Grace to what possible end? (Simon) - There are 40&#x27;000 swords in the Riverlands the largest undeclared host in the realm. Only Harrenhal is a size enough to garrison them. (Daemon) - You should know that a substantial number of those swords have now declared and are presently at war. Houses Bracken and Blackwood have long detested one another. (Simon) - Why? (Daemon) - Oh well… the answer to that is… lost in time. Sin begets sin begets sin. (Simon) - Summon your lord paramount so that I may treat with him myself and turn them to our cause. (Daemon) - That would be Lord Grover Tully but he grows frail. It’s said that he can no longer speak…. nor seal his bowels. Begging your pardon for the impression. His grip on his bannermen is weak. They feel they can do as they please. I will speak with him nonetheless. (Simon) - People should obey their liege lord… whatever his condition. Perhaps the presence of the crown and a dragon will sharpen minds around these parts. (Daemon) - Might I ask Your Grace…. if you are successful well when you are successful… what then? (Germund Strong) - We march on King’s Landing and take the throne. (Daemon) - The throne. (Simon) - It’s a big chair made of swords.” (Daemon)   “- How exhilarating to arrive at court after three long months on the road to find my lord father who served three kings faithfully unseated as Hand of the King. And by a man from such modest beginnings. What a giddying ascent the gods have bestowed on you.” (Ser Gwayne Hightower)  “- May the Seven guide you good knight… and lead you not into shadow and death. (Alicent) - I thank Your Grace for her prayers.” (Ser Criston)  “- Then we must seize the hour and act before our enemy does. They have penetrated our castle walls and now the Riverlands are aflame after the Battle at the Burning Mill. (Lord Celtigar)  - How fares Prince Daemon with our army? (Rhaenyra) - There has been no word from Prince Daemon Your Grace. (Maester Gerardys) - Then we must press what advantage we do have. (Ser Alfred Broome) - And what is that? (Rhaenyra) - Dragons. Send them all out. Start turning Green strongholds to our cause and burn those who resist. (Ser Alfred Broome) - No. If dragons begin fighting dragons we invite our own destruction. Fear of it is in itself a weapon. (Rhaenyra) - The Greens will make the same calculation. The value of a sword is not within its scabbard. (Ser Alfred Broome) - We will secure victory with armies not with dragons alone. The Greens understand that. The Vale and the North will send men. We must give Daemon time. (Rhaenyra) - Ah Your Grace you have witnessed firsthand just how vulnerable you are. Prince Daemon is abroad and Aegon’s factions are enraged at the death of his son. You have never been so exposed. (Ser Alfred Broome) - Perhaps it is time for you to think about secreting yourself somewhere safe while we remain here as a source of distraction for the enemy. (Lord Celtigar)  - You propose to conduct the war in my absence. (Rhaenyra) - It would merely be a precaution… (Lord Celtigar)  - It would be treason. You are fortunate you took it no further. (Rhaenyra) - This council would do well to remember that their queen wears the crown of my grandsire Jaehaerys the Conciliator. A prudent ruler the wisest of Targaryen kings whose reign outlasted every other… even Aegon the Conqueror’s.” (Rhaenys)  “- It would displease neither Rhaenyra nor the gods if Rhaena were named heir to Driftmark. (Rhaenys) - Rhaena? Lord of the Tides? The girl knows nothing of ships nor even of dragons. (Corlys) - There is Rhaena or there is Joffrey. Both soon to be far from the creak of ships and the ocean’s roar. (Rhaenys) - Then we must hope to see our way forward in time… (Corlys) - And if there is no time? We are at war Corlys (Rhaenys) - If something were to befall you… (Rhaenys) - Then… it is well that I am a good sailor. (Corlys),2024-07-09 22:44:56 GMT

I also saw the opportunity to insert more bullies for Aemond to really lean into that idea that fueled his current personality.  mission statement – Let’s turn Westeros into the girlhood centric sadbae YA novel of our dreams ✨  my take on –  Princess Helaena Targaryen Rider of Dreamfyre Dreams of becoming a great explorer of the world like her ancestors.  While Helaena was often ignored by the Maesters she was a wealth of knowledge of the world of Old Valyria. She is fascinated by the stories of the historic Jaenara Belaerys who traveled Sothoryos for three years never able to find its southern edge and her more recent ancestor Aerea Targaryen who disappeared for years on the back of Balerion supposedly traveling to the destitute Old Valyria where she contracted some strange deadly ailment.   In the show they are trying to show Helaena as autistic and as an autistic person I enjoy this idea! So I’m going to try to run with that as a celebration of autism and obviously not as a representation of everyone on the spectrum’s experiences.   The princess enjoys spending time alone preferring to circle King’s Landing on Dreamfyre than be fussed over by her mother and their many many maids. Helaena knows her mother is trying her best sending for nearly every eligible young lady to come to court as a way of finding friendships for Helaena. But Helaena was content with the company of her creatures. They didn’t judge her like the other girls did always correcting her behavior and explaining her many errors.  Recently Queen Alicent discovered Helaena’s ladies-in-waiting mocking her in their private chambers and the queen had to be talked down from ordering their heads on spikes in the throne room. Helaena never understood her mother’s anger she had never liked the other ladies and had never tried to befriend them that didn’t merit death.   Courtly Ladies –  Lady Ivyanne Tyrell miss-steal-your-girl  She was raised in Highgarden and was told since birth that she would have to eventually marry a lord. She knew since birth that was the worst fate. She traveled to Braavos in her youth with her father she was able to see the potential of woman in their world. It wasn’t much but it was better than a bedridden mother.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; She returned to Westeros and was sent to the Red Keep where youths were gathering to play court with the royal children. As Lady Redwyne caught the eye of the eldest prince Lord Tyrell once suggested that Ivyanne be offered to marry the second prince.   Ivyanne made sure that was an impossibility becoming one of the young Prince Aemond’s worst bullies. As the other ladies of The Reach joined in on the torment it was only a matter of time before the entirety of the teenage members of the court joined in.   She was not afraid of his dragon and endlessly commented about his eye pretending to be sick every time they crossed paths and making it a game amongst the other young ladies to run away “frightened” whenever he neared.   Does Ivyanne know what she is doing is wrong? That is hard to say. She is protecting herself the only way she knows how.   As they aged she did not let up on tormenting Aemond. While she was not allowed to train with the boys Ivyanne trained in secret instructed by her “Water Dancing” master from far-away Nossos in the way of the fists and single-edged blade. While she was not allowed to fight the other boys she knew she was accomplished. It wasn’t often that she challenged Aemond to a battle of swords but she won every match. Aemond might claim that her win was because of her gender him not wanting to hurt her but she knew the truth.   She was simply better than him.   Within the month of Aemond replacing his slain eye with a sapphire stone Ivyanne Tyrell began going by the moniker of “The Sapphire of Westeros” simply because she could. Ivyanne once noticed a beautiful maiden from Drone visiting the Red Keep for the first time that had caught the eye of a young Prince Aemond and Ivyanne took her too.   There was no education on the pleasures shared between women in the land of Westeros and Ivyanne used that to her advantage. While all her actions with other woman are physically consensual Ivyanne did not spend much time on educating to her partners that what they were doing is sex. Ivyanne spent much time courting Helaena just to get under Aemonds skin only to find that the Princess might have been smarter than Ivyanne planned with Helaena using Ivyanne for her own pleasures.  She dreams of being a great knight a great warrior but knows that is impossible in her current circumstances. She dreams of running away to Essos or even farther beyond. Her father is very aware of her desires and charges his own Green Cloaks in watching her every move.     Lady Oletta Redwyne future queen of the seven kingdoms or Princess of Wine and Pleasures  Oletta was raised on The Arbor an island off the southern coast of The Reach known for the greatest wines in all the seven kingdoms. She is the only child of the current Lord and Lady Redwyne much to the dismay of the Lord. They expect nothing but perfection from their daughter laying the survival of their ancient lineage on her shoulders.   They were both young when she caught the eye of Prince Aegon perhaps too young. Against his mothers wishes Aegon spoke of their potential engagement was if it were fact. This pleased Oletta’s family.   Because I am pushing back the Aegon/Helaena engagement to give Helaena time to have her own adventures Aegon has already agreed to the terms of his marriage to Oletta. He would become the Prince of the Arbor and all their children would take the name Redwyne. Aegon did not care much for names but haggled a construction of a dragon pit on the Arbor for his dragon Sunfyre.   Beyond her planned engagement to Prince Aegon Oletta does not know much about herself. She has spent her entire upbringing forming herself into Aegon’s perfect wife in whatever way he asked. Oletta even joined in on the ruthless bullying of Aegon’s younger brother Prince Aemond because it made Aegon laugh. One the engagement between Aegon and Helaena is announced Oletta loses herself into mind deafening anxiety.   Her friends Ivyanne and Alarie convince Oletta that her only hope for a richer husband that could impress her family could be found somewhere in Essos.      Lady Alarie Mullendore The fashion leader of Westeros  Alarie has always had an eye for business inviting herself on the Tyrell’s voyage to Braavos with Ivyanne. She is a collector of fabrics and styles from around the world keeping catalogs of patterns and textiles that make the Maesters laugh.   The Mullendore family has been drunkards for generations and Alarie wanted to break that cycle but she knew there was no way she could reach her full potential in Westeros. She dreams of owning her own business collecting her own money and paying off her own people that she would control.   I’m still working out the rest of her history and personality but she is the half-sister of my main character of this story who is unknown to them until the beginning of this story.     Tatsu - more info on Nossos trans woman // Dancing Master for Lady Ivyanne Tyrell — Pilgrim of Nossos  She was born second into a noble family knowing since birth that she was to be sent away. She felt guilty wishing ill on her elder sibling so that she could stay at home forever. But that day never came. She can barely remember her entire noble given name now. She was given all the tools she could wish for to prepare her for the long journey being educated at the feet of elders who had taken the pilgrimage before.   Newly named Tatsu traveled with a distant cousin and settled the first leg of their pilgrimage in the free city of Braavos. Tatsu threw themselves into the fighting style of the Braavosi masters sharing their own knowledge of the Nossos water dancing. So her journey began trading knowledge for skill. She hated herself every time she prayed to the Braavosi gods that she would one day hear word that she is needed to return home that her elder sibling was dead but word never came.   The Tyrell family visited the city with their young daughters offering gold and goods that weighted down multiple ships. Tatsu began her employment to the Tyrells against the wishes of her cousin claiming they were not trained to be servants. Tatsu enjoyed the taste of their wine.   Tatsu became close to the Lady Ivyanne a girl close to her own age with her own queerness that Tatsu helped nurture as they returned to Westeros together soon to move to the center of their seven kingdoms the Red Keep.,2024-07-09 22:29:48 GMT

22,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'my thoughts'  'rhaenys targaryen'  'rhaenys x corlys'],blue-mint-winter,I’m thinking about Rhaenys’ mindset of volunteering to go into battle. It makes sense she’s their strongest piece on the board - the queen in chess. If she goes the children and the Queen she swore to (the Queen she sees herself in) are safe.  But also I wonder if she was feeling like such a failure that the only way she could contribute anything meaningful was in combat. She advised to sue for peace and they lost Lucerys valuable time and allies. The council doesn’t respect her and she’s blamed for not preventing the conflict when she had the chance to kill the Greens.  But in the end it all boils down to Lucerys. Lucerys shall be avenged. Lucerys who was an innocent child. Lucerys who Laenor claimed as his son who was then chosen as heir by Corlys despite not having his blood and not fulfilling his other requirements (knowing about ships).  Rhaenys knows it’s also her fault that Corlys lost Lucerys the heir he chose and loved like his own blood. She couldn’t give him the heir he wanted because Leanor didn’t continue his line. As much as she loves their granddaughters they are Targaryens not Velaryons.   Then she sees the man who is Corlys’ illegitimate son who knows about ships went to war with Corlys and saved his life. The only thing that’s stopping Corlys from acknowledging this man as his son and heir is Corlys’ love for her.  Rhaenys realizes she’s the obstacle to Corlys’ hopes for an heir being fulfilled. Her advice was useless and enemy’s at the gates. So she volunteers to go into battle and face Vhagar alone. She must have known there was a good chance she was not coming back alive from that. But it was all she could do - to atone for her failures avenge Lucerys - or die trying and let Corlys finally have his true heir.  Because in the end of it all she loved her husband to the point she was willing to remove herself the obstacle from his path to realizing his dreams of legacy.,2024-07-09 23:59:12 GMT

Peterson approved translation of the full scene of young Rhaenyra speaking in Daemon’s vision from the most recent episode including the lines that weren’t subtitled within the show. (David J. Peterson is a linguist who specializes in conlangs and who’s worked on the High Valyrian dialogues in the show for both seasons.) In case you like me were wondering what Milly’s Rhaenyra was saying to Daemon before her final few lines please enjoy the confirmed translations for her full speech below:  “It’s been said that Targaryens are closer to gods than to men… In my eyes you were a god. Daemon Targaryen. The Prince of the City. The Lord of Flea Bottom. I was an innocent. You exploited me and abandoned me. You sullied my name at court. You empowered my rivals. You tried to make my ruin. You put me on that throne. And you love me and you hate me for it. You created me Daemon. Yet you are now set on destroying me. All because your brother loved me more than he did you.”  I wish now that they would have shown subtitles for these earlier lines as well because I think they’re very hard hitting and explain a good part of why Daemon was so incensed and upset. I especially love the “you love me and you hate me for it” line and would have appreciated seeing that in the actual episode!,2024-07-09 23:24:40 GMT

You contemplate feelings of loss at the Raventree Hall’s dead weirwood. 3.8k Words A Dragon Flees | A Raven Observes | A Shared Comfort | Harsh Words Quick Regrets | Soft Prayers | TBA        Panic bubbled within you as loud knocks woke you within your rooms. It took longer than you’d have wanted to admit to remember where you are. With the only light being two small candlesticks the darkness creeping upon the room made your breathing stop. Feeling as if great black shadows would overtake you you stumble to your door.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Opening it with a rush light spills in from the hall a most gracious sight. An almost squeak emits from who you assumed was knocking. A short girl in plain clothes hair wrapped neatly out of her way bows to you deeply.   “Your Highness the feast is soon.” She says softly you stare at each other for a moment. She had seen your panicked state and it seems as if both of you were unsure how to address it. Your mouth is opening and closing nothing is coming out and you’re momentarily frozen.  “Uh uhm.” Mumbling you look down at yourself and frown “I am not dressed.” You simply state as you look back up to her. After your interesting interaction with Benjicot. You cringe thinking about it. You had pulled yourself to your new bed not being bothered removing any clothing and had quickly fallen asleep.  “You are not Princess.” Nodding to you she has her hands clasped in front of her and she rocks back and forth on her heels before sweetly asking “Do you wish for assistance highness?”  A deep blush burns hot in your cheeks as you nod quietly and step aside to allow her in. She has a pleasant skip in her step as she takes one candle and goes along the room in a mission to light all others. Before taking long strides towards your clothing. The servants before her had already taken the liberty of unpacking your saddlebag. A task you are deeply grateful of them for doing.  You swing the hefty door closed padding closer to her slowly you notice a great stench. Though when she passed you you thought she smelled quite pleasant. Almost an air of fresh spring follows her you wonder if everyone in the Riverlands carries that with them. Then it hits you like a punch to the gut dear god you reeked of dragon.   “Miss” You trail off not having caught her name if she ever even told you it in the first place. You place yourself by her side as she sorts through the dresses you had brought along with you. She hums looking at you “Oh!” She exclaims quickly “Cerissa Princess if it pleases you.” She bows her head down momentarily stopping her careful examination of your available clothing.  “Cerissa” You smile warmly at her “I had ridden far longer than I imagined.” You explain quickly and then making a face of disgust “I smell as if I have slept in the Dragonpit itself.” And she tries to stifle a small giggle before turning away from you.  “No worries I shall call you a bath in haste.” On the opposite side of the room she disappears behind a finely embroidered partition. You hear the small ring of a bell curiously you walk closer. Behind the divider was a sizable wash basin. Cerissa quickly makes herself busy in reigniting your hearth stoking the fire until it raises itself high. “Any minute now.” She smiles at you.  Following her back to your clothing as if you were a lost puppy you see her satisfied with herself as she finally finds the dresses you had packed. Looking at you she pulls out the dress encompassing your house colors. A radiant shade of red with the details and outline entirely black that would certainly make an impression.  Halfway through your bath Cerissa is helping you detangle dragon swept hair there is another knock on your door. She sets the comb down as you continue to scrub the smell of dragon off you. Rubbing your skin red in the attempt however it gets the job done. Much to your delight the torches lining the hall create a bright warm casting of light not a shadow to be seen. The light flooded into your room with what little cracks it could find itself through as she opened it slightly and peers outside. You can hear them talking but you cannot make out what they’re saying.  Quickly she closes the door and heads back towards you in a hurry.   “The feast is about to begin Princess.” She says as she sits herself back down to see to your hair. At this you are alarmed while she remains entirely calm.  “I will be late!” You fretted holding your hands to the edges of the tub the water flowing back and forth at your quick movements. As you sit up water flings off your arms and chest you frantically almost rise to your feet until Cerissa stops you.  “We’ll just have to be” She trails off a second trying to find the right words “Your highness we shall just be fashionably late. What a grand entrance it will be.” She finishes as she lightly guides you back down into the now room temperature water.  ~  You were smug about allowing Cerissa to convince you to take your time rather than rush. She was right as you walked to the dining hall of Raventree every guard and every servant you passed would not take their eyes off you. At first you had tried to convince yourself it was because you’re the princess and they have a duty to protect you. The longer they stared though the more flushed your cheeks became as it was quickly apparent that was not the case.   She must’ve done something you think to make you look and feel this radiant. Though she was being humble and said it was all you as your presence remains in the Riverlands.   Nevertheless you held your chin up high and your back straight as your mother had taught you. Let them stare you think. Let them stare and understand the power you have only as the mere Princess of their One True Queen. You doubt you needed to strengthen the claim of the Riverlands any more in the Blacks grasp as it already was but it wouldn’t hurt. Besides men gossipped at war worse than their ladies did over tea at home. If you show the colors of the dragon word is bound to get out.   You could hear the hall full of noise before you approached the doors. Though once one door and then the other had let out a great old creek it all began to quickly hush. There was an electric feeling in the air you had never felt before excitement rising in your belly. You had always fell behind your brothers or had been one of many royals in attendance of a feast. This time you thought a bit selfishly it was all about you.  The doors had finally been swung entirely open all eyes were on you. Your breathing quickened attempting to keep calm you held your head high and stared only at Lord Samwell. An unlikely gracious sight you wouldn’t have thought would be a mere day ago.   A long table lined each side of you as you walked down the seemingly never ending hall. You are doing well you think keeping a good pace and not panicking. That was until you allowed your eyes to wander to who sits next to Samwell. You don’t know who else you would have expected to be sitting beside the current Lord of Raventree Hall being anyone but his son. Yet he still took you by surprise looking over his handsome face and dark hair your pace falters.   You suddenly slow almost to a full stop once you realize the empty seat beside him. Quickly reminding yourself to breathe and ignoring how hot your face suddenly feels you look back towards his father. Making haste to resume to your previous pace as you arrive at the front of their table. Everything is so quiet still you regret being excited to be the main focus. How your mother does this every day as Queen you haven’t a single clue.   You smile at Lord Samwell before clasping your hands together in front of you wringing them to calm your growing nerves and begin to speak.  “Forgive me my lord for my tardiness it had taken me longer to recover from my travels than I thought it would.” The boisterous man pushes his chair back with a deafening screech across the floor and stands. You are almost afraid to be insulted for your lateness. Instead the ever kind Samwell smiles and raises a glass to you.  “Nonsense Princess! It seems the Riverlands agree with you well.” His voice reverberated around the room “There is no end of time we would wait for our Dear Queens only daughter. Come join us!” He motions to the empty seat next to Benjicot.   You hold a polite smile and internally scream at where your seat is. As you begin to make way towards the small step rising the Blackwoods table above everyone else’s Samwell raises his glass into the air. You watch on before sitting as everyone else in the hall including the boy you were to sit next to does theirs.  “To the Queen!” It echoes from every man woman and child’s voice.  Voices you had never heard before from people you had never spoken to. All feasting to your Mother the Queen in all her own right. It almost brought you to tears. You quickly look down as you rest yourself in your seat hiding your face slightly. Sitting next to Benjicot you for sure did not want him to see your surprise or weakness in your glassy eyes.  As you reach for your wine to the right of you yearning for the possible buzz it may give you. You hear a clearing of a throat next to you. You turn still holding your lips to the chalice as you take a sip of the deep red liquid. Benjicot stares back at you almost frozen again eyes wide as he did realize he had gained your attention. You swallow setting the cup down in front of you.  ‘Is there something you need my lord?’   Eyes still as wide as before he swallows and looks down for a moment. Taking in a great breath he looks back up to you. His eyes are soft a color you could get lost in you think for a moment.  “I want to apologize Princess.” He smiles a genuine smile at you “It was not right to tease you.” He keeps his gaze locked on your face and you search his in return. Looking for any sign of any untruth that had come across in his words. You nod at him before answering.  “You’re right My lord.” You keep your chin high for a moment though upon seeing the nervousness in him you relax a bit for his comfort.   A taunting smile washes over you “Fear not you’re not my dragons next meal” His shoulders drop their tense stature as relief washes over him. “Yet.” You complete the thought.  You cannot help but laugh as the alarm on his face shows. You would not feed someone to your dragon unless it were to be a green you think. It was funny to you though that Lords and Ladies were so sure every rumor of terror a dragon could do was so true. With Arcturus’s picky distaste for goats you doubted he would have any joy for eating a person.   At your laugh Benjicot smiles back at you a small nervous chuckle leaving him as well. At this you lightly bump your shoulder into his as if to confirm you were only jesting. Both of you turn back to your meals. You eat slowly though you wish to devour every bite quicker than a pig served slop in your hunger. You stop yourself out of fear of looking like a fool. “About your dragon” Benjicot speaks trailing off carefully thinking over his next words. “Us all coming from the Riverlands we have never had the pleasure of hosting one.” You look at him curiously. “Let alone feeding one.” You lean towards him slightly puzzled as to what he was getting at. He pauses and you feel as if he is taking too long to finish his thoughts.  “Well? Spit it out my lord.” You provoked him. Then comes his rush of words spilling from him quickly.  “He has not been fed.” He admits “I had seen to it as promised but there isn’t a brave enough soul within Raventree Hall that is willing to approach him.”  You gawk at him for a moment disbelief rushing through you. “Not even you Lord Benjicot?” You quipped recalling his reaction to your arrival. Surely you thought he would not be so scared of Arcturus.   His face quickly burns bright red cheek to cheek from one ear to the other. He looks down in what was surely embarrassment or even shame. His breathing is quick and he looks back up to you once more.  “From our previous interaction I was unsure of his sentiments towards me.” He trails off looking at you apprehensively. Nodding you grab for your chalice.  “Then I must do it myself.” You down the rest of the sweet drink as you rise from your chair quietly. “My Lord Samwell” You assert yourself as the man breaks from his conversation to address you. “It seems my dragon has yet to be fed and I wish to attend to the matter myself.” Your words are slightly rushed as you watch heads from all over the dining hall turn in your direction. “Please excuse me.” You take quick steps off the platform before turning back to the table.   “Are you coming?” You invite Benjicot not bothering to hear his answer as you already begin to swiftly head for the exit of the dining hall. You already hear the whispers and oohs coming from some of the young lords who had heard your words to him. Already halfway to the grand doors of the castle you hear quick footsteps follow your path.  “Would you kindly show me the sheep you have taken from the flock for him?” You say as his pace finally matches yours and he is at your side.  He nods and you begin to realize that what may have been mistaken for shyness as you had been told was just his quietness. He was a man of few words and you had not minded it in the least. You think of your stepfather Daemon he always had a word to say. Maybe you like a man better when he has less to say. You’re amused at this thought as you follow Benjicot through the doors.   You follow him for a while as he leads you to a post just near the stables. Several sheared sheep remain tied with leads against it much too many you think. Though you are glad they had been sheared a dragons hairball is your nightmare from experience.   He reaches to take the leads and you step forward and stop him reaching your hand over his. You take only three of the bunch. He looks at you quizzically. “Should he not feast on more as you said?” He quietly inquires about you. Dear gods you think did all people of the Riverlands believe in everything that has been said about a dragon? You smile at him anyway as you shake your head holding the leads of the sheep tightly.  “These will do.” You say over your shoulder to him as you follow the path you had taken away from your dragon last.   Turning towards the great field you see your beloved dragon. Curled as if he were a cat on a rug before a fireplace underneath the weirwood. Several ravens lay upon each branch of the tree looking down upon him though they do not seem alarmed and surprisingly Arcturus does not mind. His great body begins to awaken as he feels your approach.   “eman iā kisalbar syt ao” You call to him marvling even after all this time at his mighty figure.  I have a treat for you.  The sheep cower behind you already knowing their fate. They pull against the leads as Arcturus rises to his feet. You do not look behind you though you have a feeling Benjicot may feel almost the same way as the sheep.  “istia umbagon” you give the command. A huff of frustration comes from the dragon the blow of air whipping strands of your hair back quickly. Though he awaits patiently watching your every movement. You walk quickly having to tug at the leads of the sheep as you lead them past the predator. Finally stopping at the top of the hill you remove the leads one by one and watch as they flee down it.   You must wait.  You turn seeing your dragon no longer looking at you but watching the sheep as they attempt their escape. Benjicot remains stiff as a statue in the place you had left him. You shake your head you forget your familiarity with dragons is not within everyone. You keep your eyes locked with his his fear evident. Opening your mouth seeing both dragon and man’s muscles tense awaiting your command.  “Jikagon” you lean forward a taunting smile escaping you. Archturus doesn’t even need to hear the whole word before he is off. The quickness of him nearly knocks Benjicot off his feet as he stumbles backward.   Go.  A grin spreads widely across your face beaming proudly.   “He really is not so scary.” You hummed to him as you walked his way arms held behind your back.  “Not scary?” He says exasperatedly “In what world? Surely not ours.” He huffed folding his arms to his front. Your face darkens quickly.  “There are many larger than him.” You sigh turning towards the great big weirwood tree. Like Vhagar you think to yourself. Bitter at the thought of the great she-dragon and her rider that remain in Kingslanding with no consequence. The ravens sitting upon the tree look back at you tilting their heads. They had not fled when Arcturus rose and bounded across the fields.   You see Benjicot step quietly beside you in your peripheral yet your eyes remain stuck to the tree.   “I have not yet told you my condolences.” He attempted to console you but at this point you were far more tired of hearing sorries about your brother. You’d rather not hear them they didn’t know him like you did they didn’t watch him grow as you had.  “You have no need to my lord.” You say softly looking at him. He was already staring at you those eyes studying you once more.   “I lost my mother when I was very young.” He lamented. You look back towards the tree bathing under the moonlight again. Unsure if you are able to lock eyes to meet grief with grief. “It was” he pauses for a moment before continuing on. “A great deal of hurt for me and my father.” He steps ever closer to you and your shoulders are side by side as you both look forward. His words of comfort were kind   “It’s not the same.” You whisper unsure if you wish to hear you maybe you did and could not admit it.  “I know.” He maintained and you looked over at him. He smiles sadly at you “Loss is loss. You are not alone Princess.”  Tears threaten to escape you looking upwards for a moment to contain them. A great pang of the hurt that resides in you throbs once more for a moment.  “Loss is loss.” You repeated back at him in affirmation.   Despite the hurt and the bitterness that had washed within you in waves you felt a brief sense of peace. If only for a moment. He had allowed you that and you were grateful. Even in your continued silence after that you felt a great deal of comfort.   ~  You both had stood there for longer than you had anticipated. Both unwilling to let go of the quiet slice of serenity you had achieved. It lulled over the both of you. There was an understanding between you that this was perhaps one of very few times the gods will allow it in the times to come. You eagerly accepted it grasping internally at whatever you were allowed to have.   “It’s getting late.” You state a sigh leaving you as you know you should return to the soft comforts of your chambers.  “May I escort you to your rooms princess?” He smiles “This time I won’t tease you.” A hint of mischief evident within his eyes. “As much.” He nods his head finishing the sentence.  “You may” You say giggling at his boyishness. Previous incident aside he was quite sweet.   Walking together you both enter the castle though slowly. Wanting to savor the left over comfort from before as it waned. Through the brightly lit halls you do not mind being beside him brushing shoulder to shoulder against each other. Stopping just in front of the door to your rooms you stand across from each other. Both locking eyes and you debate on what to say to him.  “Thank you Lord Benjic-” You begin to thank him but are interrupted quickly.  “Benji.” He states before explaining. “Just that I prefer it my name is otherwise a mouthful.” Your eyes widen slightly in surprise before giving him a smile and a nod.  “If we are to forgo titles” You muse “(y/n) just that. Benji.” Your cheeks burn at the realization that you had given the lord a great privilege.   “(y/n).” He repeats. You had never felt your name sounded so sweet before it was him who said it.   You reach for the handle of your door and open it a great creek admitting from the hinges. Smiling at him softly you slip through the doorway before turning to look at him. He is still standing there looking at you as if awaiting any other word from you.   “Goodnight” You bid him before adding. “Benji.” His cheeks tint at the sound of his name.  “Goodnight (y/n).”     Likes comments and reblogs always appreciated!  a/n  hiiiii arent they sweet(also YES i am very well aware his mother was the one widowed during war but let me live in my own fantasy world man) i hadnt realized this was going to be a slow burn i apologize to yall its come to a surprise to me too.

22,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'my thoughts'  'rhaenys targaryen'  'rhaenys x corlys'],blue-mint-winter,I’m thinking about Rhaenys’ mindset of volunteering to go into battle. It makes sense she’s their strongest piece on the board - the queen in chess. If she goes the children and the Queen she swore to (the Queen she sees herself in) are safe.  But also I wonder if she was feeling like such a failure that the only way she could contribute anything meaningful was in combat. She advised to sue for peace and they lost Lucerys valuable time and allies. The council doesn’t respect her and she’s blamed for not preventing the conflict when she had the chance to kill the Greens.  But in the end it all boils down to Lucerys. Lucerys shall be avenged. Lucerys who was an innocent child. Lucerys who Laenor claimed as his son who was then chosen as heir by Corlys despite not having his blood and not fulfilling his other requirements (knowing about ships).  Rhaenys knows it’s also her fault that Corlys lost Lucerys the heir he chose and loved like his own blood. She couldn’t give him the heir he wanted because Leanor didn’t continue his line. As much as she loves their granddaughters they are Targaryens not Velaryons.   Then she sees the man who is Corlys’ illegitimate son who knows about ships went to war with Corlys and saved his life. The only thing that’s stopping Corlys from acknowledging this man as his son and heir is Corlys’ love for her.  Rhaenys realizes she’s the obstacle to Corlys’ hopes for an heir being fulfilled. Her advice was useless and enemy’s at the gates. So she volunteers to go into battle and face Vhagar alone. She must have known there was a good chance she was not coming back alive from that. But it was all she could do - to atone for her failures avenge Lucerys - or die trying and let Corlys finally have his true heir.  Because in the end of it all she loved her husband to the point she was willing to remove herself the obstacle from his path to realizing his dreams of legacy.,2024-07-09 23:59:12 GMT

Reader )   Summary: The reader is sent to Old Town with Daeron however is left in an uncomfortable situation when her uncle finds her with a pillow.  Warnings: explicit smut under the cut minors do not interact incest age gap reader has a pillow princess moment oral (female receiving) penetration Gwayne is giving sub vibes.  Word count: 3728  The journey to Old Town was arduous and slow a monotonous trek that seemed designed to drain one’s spirit. Few things could be more disheartening than being sent to Old Town a place that felt like exile. Your mother the queen insisted that sending you and your younger brother Daeron there was for the best claiming it would build character—whatever that meant. Yet you couldn’t shake the feeling that she simply preferred not to deal with you. Sending you and Daeron away made it easier for her to focus on Aegon. Despite her intentions you were frustrated by being uprooted from your home all in the name of this so-called character building.  When the carriage finally arrived in Old Town your eyes took in the sights as you traveled swiftly through the city. Having spent your entire life in King’s Landing Old Town seemed exceptionally small. You noticed the tall walls surrounding the castle some sections near the gate clad in ivy.  “Finally we’re here” Daeron exclaimed as he rushed to the carriage door eager to free himself from its confines.  With a mix of frustration and disgust you pushed at your brother’s back as he deliberately blocked the carriage door trapping you inside. “Daeron!” you shouted your hands shoving at the coarse fabric of his shirt. “Let me out you fool!” You struggled against him as he laughed his mirth only heightening your irritation.  Suddenly another voice cut through the commotion. “Come now my prince. Let your sister out” it urged. Reluctantly Daeron relented and stepped down the few stairs finally freeing you from the confined space of the carriage.  As you finally freed yourself from the carriage you realized the voice belonged to your uncle Gwayne Hightower. Though many years had passed since you last saw him you recognized him instantly. Stepping forward your feet now firmly planted on the ground you shot a sharp glare at Daeron resisting the urge to shove him before turning back to your uncle.  “Thank you Uncle” you said with a small nod.  Daeron looking bewildered finally noticed Gwayne. “Oh—Uncle Gwayne. I didn’t recognize you” he replied prompting you to narrow your eyes.  “I’m not surprised” you said. “You were but a babe the last time he visited.”  “Indeed you were” Gwayne said with a warm smile. “I’m surprised you recognize me Princess. You’ve grown as much as your brother.”  He stepped forward extending his hand toward you. You raised yours to meet his and he took it gently bringing it to his lips with a delicate kiss that conveyed a soft caring warmth. Your eyes fluttered slightly as you looked at him appreciating the affectionate gesture.  “You’ve grown so much” he remarked turning his attention to Daeron.  “I’m certain I haven’t grown that much” you insisted with a modest smile.  Daeron glanced at you a mischievous glint in his eyes and snorted. “Oh trust me you’ve grown—just not in height sister” he mocked. Unable to restrain yourself you gave him a small shove in response.  Your uncle watched the exchange a faint smile playing on his lips and shook his head with a soft chuckle at your sibling rivalry.  Gwayne shook his head with a gentle sigh his gaze shifting to Daeron. “Now nephew I understand why your mother insisted on sending you here. One day you’ll realize the value of your sister’s presence. Treat her with the respect she deserves” he urged his tone firm yet compassionate. You cast a sidelong glance at your brother a small smile playing on your lips now that your uncle had come to your defense.  Daeron responded with an eye roll his demeanor defiant. Gwayne cleared his throat his expression turning more serious. “I’ll have your cousin show you to your room Daeron” he declared nodding towards him. “As for you Princess” Gwayne continued extending his arm toward you. “I will personally escort you to your chambers.” You took his arm promptly grateful for his support and guidance in this unfamiliar place.  Gwayne escorted you up the stairs and down a hallway to your assigned room. As the door swung open you couldn’t shake the feeling of entering a stranger’s room. Though the space was well-appointed and fair it lacked the personal touch of home. Sensing your unease Gwayne spoke up as the two of you entered.  “This will be your chambers. My quarters are just next door” he explained his voice reassuring. “Consider me your protector close at hand.” His words were accompanied by a small comforting smile.  In that moment you realized Gwayne’s striking presence: his piercing blue eyes chiseled jawline and eloquent speech. His demeanor offered a sense of security that eased your nerves prompting you to return his smile warmly.  “You are to be your sworn protector then?” you questioned eyebrows knitting together as you stood somewhat puzzled. Gwayne couldn’t help but chuckle softly as he shook his head.  “No sweet niece. There’s no need for that here” he reassured you gently “but I promise to watch over you.” His words carried a comforting assurance.  You nodded in understanding your hand still linked with his arm. “Did my mother explain why she sent me here?” you asked recalling her vague answers and insistence that leaving the Red Keep was in your best interest. Gwayne sensed your unease and took your hands in his with tender care.  “Niece” he spoke softly “Your mother didn’t want to send you away but you’re soon to be married—or at least betrothed. She thought it would be easier for you not to be uprooted from your home like many maidens are.” His explanation caused you to look away a mixture of emotions stirring within you.  “I don’t want to be betrothed to a stranger” you confessed to your uncle your hands still held in his. “The thought of belonging to a man I don’t know who doesn’t know me—it frightens me.”  Gwayne’s expression softened at your confession. He released one of your hands and gently cupped your chin guiding your gaze to meet his. His blue eyes held a depth of understanding as he listened intently to your words.  “Your feelings are valid my dear. Many women share your apprehensions—I know your mother did” Gwayne said soothingly hoping to bring you comfort. “Besides not every lady finds herself betrothed to a stranger. Try not to let fear cloud your judgment until you’ve had the chance to know your intended” he urged gently sensing he had eased your nerves.  “I’ll leave you to rest now” Gwayne added seeing your nod of approval. With that he quietly exited your chambers.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; As night descended upon Old Town you tossed and turned in your sleep consumed by an unrelenting yearning. The unfamiliar blankets and sheets devoid of your scent offered no comfort. Frustrated you reached for a plush pillow sitting up and clutching it tightly between your thighs. Slowly you would rock your hips back and forth pushing down your core with some friction to alleviate this frustration that burned between your thighs. Your eyes fluttered closed your night gown slipping from your shoulder as your hips desperately humped the pillow beneath you. You thought of your uncle you knew you shouldn’t and yet- you could not help but to think of how kissed your hand the blue of his eyes how he smelled of sage.  On the other side of the door Gwayne awoke to a plaintive sound that he initially mistook for a cry. Even through the stone walls the soft echo of his niece’s distress reached him. With concern driving him Gwayne rose from his bed the urgency of his duty as her uncle compelling him. He slipped into a pair of pants and quietly left his room.  It was his responsibility to care for and protect her in this unfamiliar place in the absence of their family. Moving with cautious steps Gwayne approached her door. Normally he would have knocked but in his haste and concern he bypassed this customary courtesy. He gently pushed the door open making as little noise as possible.   What Gwayne had come face to face with made him freeze his entire body tensing up as he looked to the figure of you the princess feverously humping a pillow. Your shoulder exposed and hard nipples showing through the sheer of the night gown. Your eyes were still closed as your hips rocked against the pillow. Eyebrows pushed together as soft cries left your lips. Gwayne was more than aware that he should not be there that he should not be witnessing this and yet he could not tear his eyes away.  Then you said it “Gwayne.” His name left your lips like a melody and it took one hush of his name to make him impossibly hard. To the point in stung and bulged from his trousers. It was then your eyes fluttered open and in a few blinks they widened realizing that your uncle stood in the doorway. In a panic your hands grasped the pillow and brought it up to cover yourself.   “Oh Gods. Princess I’m -I’m sorry -” Gwayne barely managed to gush an apology as he had went fleeing the room closing the door behind him as he went rushing back to his room. In the midst of his embarrassment he had been sweating his heart racing as he stayed in the confides of his room.   He was still hard. Gwayne tried not to think about you. He tried not to think about how you cried as you humped your pillow or how sweetly you spoke his name but he could not.   Gwayne would wrestle with himself for nearly an hour but at the agony of his own groin he could not contain himself. Gwayne would still be standing as he pulled his pants down freeing his length as he took it in one hand.   This was wrong this was so wrong.   And still he began to pump himself to the thought of you pleasing yourself with a pillow.  I shouldn’t be doing this.   He wondered how it would feel to be between your soft thighs to have you be humping him.  He was almost there.   To have you scream his name instead of whisper it.  Gwayne would soon spill his seed onto the ground as his hand feverishly pumped himself to the thought of you. Gwayne would attempt to find sleep that night but had been unable to do so.     When the next day dawned you anticipated a conversation with your uncle about the events of the previous night. However it soon became apparent that Gwayne was actively avoiding you. He didn’t join you for breakfast or supper and your cousin took it upon themselves to entertain you with a tour of Old Town while another cousin kept you occupied with needlepoint throughout the day. Despite your efforts the entire day passed without a glimpse of him.  Returning to your chambers in the evening a growing discomfort settled within you. You couldn’t shake the feeling that Gwayne’s absence was deliberate. Did he feel embarrassed for having found you in distress? Was he ashamed of you? These thoughts churned in your mind as you lay on your bed staring up at the canopy for what felt like an eternity.  Finally unable to endure the uncertainty any longer you threw off the blankets and stormed out of your chambers. Determined you strode purposefully to his door bypassing the courtesy of knocking—after all he hadn’t extended the same courtesy to you last night. You entered his chambers with your face flushed with agitation.  Inside Gwayne was not asleep. He sat up in bed bare-chested with the blankets draped over his hips revealing that he wore nothing underneath either.  “Princess what are you doing?” Gwayne asked abruptly his gaze flickering to the sheerness of your nightgown which left little to the imagination. It was evident that your attire was not quite appropriate for a princess but after what Gwayne had witnessed the previous night your choice of clothing was the least of your concerns.  “You walked in on me last night and now you avoid me all day?” you questioned boldly lifting your chin as you approached his bedside. Gwayne’s hands tightened on the blanket his discomfort palpable as you drew nearer.  “You should go” he insisted attempting to avert his eyes from you.  “Why?” You questioned sharply as he approached. “Are you ashamed of me now?”  Gwayne shook his head you had not yet noticed and he had hoped you hadn’t as he looked away.   “It’s not that.” he insisted quietly.  Your eyes looked down the look of anger seeming to melt from your face as your eyes noticed the bulge beneath the blankets. He was hard trying to hide it but failing to do so.   “Please leave.” He was begging with all restraint he had. Gwayne could not even look you in the eye as he kept the blankets around him.   You stood there for a moment unsure how to approach but desire beginning to burn between your legs as you looked to him.  “Do you desire me uncle?” You questioned moving closer to him as a hand gently touched his thigh grabbing a handful of the sheets he was using to cover himself.   “It is wrong- I should not.” He said answering your question without actually answering your question. It was enough for you his grip tightening to hold the sheets in place as you carefully slid one leg up on the bed allowing it to rest on one side of him. Gwayne showed restraint but only little.   “Who says?” you questioned eyes staring into his as he finally had enough gull to look at you.   “The Gods.” he declared. “Common law-” he tried to say with some reason the one thread of restraint still holding on within him.   “Fuck the Gods” You declared as your hand gave a gentle pull at the sheets. “Fuck Common Law-” He continued to hold on as you pulled. “And fuck me.” you said nearly pleading.   Gwayne held the blankets for a moment longer as his eyes looked to you. “You are a maiden are you not?” He questioned unsure in this moment based on your behavior.   “I am.” you declared honestly as you looked to him.  “I can not deflower my own niece.” He said allowing a moment of pride to shield him.   “I do not want my first time to be with some lord that I am married off to as a bargaining chip.” You insisted nearly pleading. “I desire you uncle and you desire me.” You declared his grip on the sheet loosening.   Gwayne battled with himself for a moment but only for a moment for his strong hands would reach for your face pulling you gently to meet his lips. Your body pulled onto him as your lips met his. Gwayne kissed your lips with the hunger of a starved man his hands moved to your night gown and pulled it up parting his lips to discard it from your body leaving you exposed to him.  He wasted little time in pushing you down onto the mattress allowing himself to rest above you. In the moon light he took in your bare figure soon peppering kisses between the valley of your breast and down your body to your cunt. His lips would kiss down to your bud before he grabbed onto your hips. Pulling your thighs to rest on his shoulders as his face pushed into your cunt in a way a pillow never could. It was by this that you were already squirming back arching at his touch.   Gwayne would not hesitate to allow his tongue to lay flat against your flushed sensitive bud your hips pushing down slightly as he tried to keep you in place with his grip. Gwayne would lick slowly tasting your virgin cunt as if it was a delicacy something he was determine to savor.   Soft moans left your lips as his tongue continued to work against your dripping cunt. Gwayne was carefully when he inserted a finger inside of you. He did not dare to put more than one for with just one finger he could feel how incredibly tight you were. a realization that caused his cock to ache.   Gwayne would slowly pump his finger in and out of you as you moaned loudly your hands becoming entangled in his long locks and your thighs pushing shut against him. Gwayne wanted to question you to ask how you were so sensitive why you tasted so sweet- but he could not bring himself to remove his tongue if the king himself demanded it.   There would be a hot coil inside of you that would form growing tighter as your wet cunt clenched around his finger and within a moment the coil snapped. A warm orgasm flushing over you as your thighs squeezed his head without mercy soft tears fell from your eyes as you came down from your high. You were panting as your thighs loosened Gwayne would pull his finger from you before sticking it in his mouth to suck in clean of your sweet juices.   The two of you locked eyes as you stared at one another for a moment. His hard cock pushed against the inside of your thigh as he debated if he should go through with this.   “We shouldn’t.” Gwayne gave a small fight once more for the sake of his honor and your own.   “Who would know?” You offered a simple excuse hoping he would not declare the gods again.   “Who would know …” he repeated before he nodded. “You’re right. Who would know.” Gwayne reasoned as he grabbed his cock as he had carefully begun to move it against the wet folds of your cunt.  “You could drink moon tea after.” he suggested again as you nodded in response.   “You’re sure?” he asked again his blue eyes looking to you with tender concern but also the last bit of restraint he had in him.   “I am.” You said as you pushed yourself down on him slightly causing him to groan.  Gwayne could wait no longer and therefore he lined himself up at your entrance and gently he begun to penetrate you sliding into your wet cunt slowly.   Your back arched at the feeling of him filling you he stilled with only part of himself in you.   “More.” You whined out in a demand as you waited for him to fill you completely.   “Patient princess. Please- I do not wish to be spent so soon.” Gwayne insisted he had slowly begun to push into you. Your legs would soon tighten around his waist forcing him to put the rest of himself in. A moan came from the both of you as he would soon begin to move slowly.   “Gods you’re so tight.” He groaned as he slowly thrusted in and out of you at a slow rate doing his best not to spill himself inside of you this early.   Gwayne would allow his thumb to return to your swollen bulb rubbing it softly as he continued to fuck you at a slow and passionate rate. Despite the slow thrust he pushed deep into your warm velvet walls each time enjoying the feeling of you squeezing his entire length.   Gwayne would continue at this slow rate as you cried out soon lewd sounds of your wetness would fill the room mixed with your moans.   “I want to be on top.” You pleaded his hips stilled with hesitation. “Please.” you begged.   Gwayne hesitated but even he could not resist. He pulled out of you slowly before allowing his body to fall onto the bed. You wasted no time climbing on top of him and taking his length in your hand. Carefully you lowered your hips onto him.   “Fuck.” Gwayne would groan at the sight of you above him. The vision of a Targaryen princess nude above him as your hips begun to feverishly bounce on his cock. It took everything in him to not spill himself in you at this very moment.   “Princess please.” He pleaded his hands grabbing on your waist to try and slow you down but it was no use you used him. Moving your hips quickly as you looked to him.   “Hold on uncle. I’m almost there.” You would insisted in a moan as you continued the feeling of him throbbing inside of you as you fucked yourself on him was enough to let out a cry of pleasure.   “Please get off … &quot;He begged &quot;I shouldn’t … not inside of you.” He insisted more as he tried to steady your hips though as you moved he relented.  Gwayne could not hold himself back any longer his fingers dug into your flesh as he came deep inside you. You continued as he filled you with his warm seed. Allowing yourself to fuck every last drop inside of you peeking your own orgasm that caused Gwayne to grit his teeth. You would roll your hips over him riding out your high before falling helplessly on the bed next to him. His seed spilling onto your plush thighs.   Gwayne panted as he had looked over to you with soft affection. “I’ll have the maester make you moon tea in the morning.” he insisted as you looked over to him with a small smile.   “Perhaps if you seed me with your child mother would be forced to marry me to you.” You offered looking to him next to you in the bed.   “Or she would have my head.” he offered back.     When morning came you were nearly limping as you joined Daeron at the breakfast table he seemed somewhat restless as he picked at the eggs on his plate.   “There you are.” He declared looking to you with dark shadows surrounding his eyes.   “You look like shit.” You declared to him with no one else around he looked to you with somewhat of a resenting look.   “Yeah well if you’re going to fuck our uncle again could you at least keep it down.” Daeron declared.  You froze at his comment you were going to muster up some kind of denial but Daeron spoke again.   “My chambers are on the other side of Uncle Gwaynes.” He informed you.,2024-07-10 01:52:03 GMT

Tags: angst illness cw: talks of potential miscarriage.   taglist: @callsignwidow @whimsicalmystic02   word count: 3319   Keep track of the story: masterlist  &lt;!-- more --&gt; A long beat resounded between Benjicot looking at his wife while Aemma glared at the cursed gift.   After another short beat Aemma turned to Benji with a pleading eye “Ben I-”   “What does it mean ‘You know my heart is yours as your eye mine’ Aemma?” interrupted Benji increasingly upset.   Aemma breathed as she tried to reach her husband who slowly backed away from her “The ‘gift’ was from Aegon who has a delusion that I’m in love with him but-”   “Why would the usurper ever think you love him?” Benjicot asked looking at her eyes storming.   Aemma closed her eyes and exhaled through her nose “When we were children we made a stupid promise to marry each other but it was a silly child game… it-”   “It was real enough for him to send a blasted gift for OUR wedding claiming that he loves you and you love him back!” shouted Benjicot angrily.   Aemma’s eyes widened in shock at his response and she grew slightly upset.   “It’s his delusions. He is like a spoiled toddler who throws tantrums when he doesn’t get his way! I don’t love him; we were kids! Ben you need to understand that!” exclaimed Aemma; she just wanted her husband to understand and let her explain the story calmly.   Benjicot angrily shook his head and started walking towards the tent exit with Aemma following him “Were you never going to tell me? Hoping that his delusions would just fade or that I am left unaware that a certain false king thinks he has a claim to MY wife?!”   “No! I was going to tell you but I was going to tell you after the wedding but then the battle happened and I didn’t think he was that crazy to send that stupid box!” Aemma explained as she tried to touch his shoulder but Benji shoved it off.   “I don’t know Aemma. You told me our courtship shouldn’t start with lies but here you start our marriage with one…” Turned Benji with tears streaming down his face.   “I would never lie to you Ben. I don’t love him. I don’t love any other man but you! You are my husband. I don’t want any other man but you!” Aemma started her heart breaking into pieces tears streaming down her face.   Benjicot shook his head. “I don’t know; I just need time to think…. I think we should sleep in separate beds for the time being… I just need to not be with you” he said as he walked out.   “No! Ben… Benji… BENJICOT BLACKWOOD!” Shouted Aemma gasping as she collapsed to the ground sobbing.   Aemma sobbed for a few minutes before angrily turning to the cursed gift. She grabbed it with the note and threw it into the hearth of the tent. She despised Aegon; she wished Sliverwing had bitten off his head rather than his leg. All she wanted to do was be in her husband’s arms but now he wouldn’t even look at her.   After cleaning herself up and checking that she didn’t look like she was sobbing she had a few trusted handmaidens take a few of her things and the wedding gifts back to her tent. As she sat on her bed Aemma stared at the fire. She couldn’t believe her marriage was going to estrangement barely a few days in… As she remembered her grandmother’s words Aemma wondered if she should have just married for duty and not love. For love it hurts too much. Oh how she wished this was a nightmare she could wake from.   As Benjicot returned to his tent he was muddy and sweaty. He scanned the room and there was no sign of Aemma. He knew he had asked her to leave but he hoped she would have disobeyed and stayed. But would he have stayed if she had? Would he have listened to her? He didn’t know; he sighed as he sat on his bed placing his head in his hands. After a quick bath he lay in bed missing his wife’s warmth.   Over the next few weeks everyone started to notice something going on with the princess and lord but when they were asked about it Aemma responded that she was just tense from her grandmother’s injuries and the death of Meleys. Benjicot stated he just wanted to prepare his men for the next battle and needed to perform his mundane lordly duties. Jace and Baela were worried. Aemma was getting skinnier and had dark eye circles but she always shook them off.   As Rhaenyra prepared to return to Dragonstone with Jacaerys Baela Rhaenys and Corlys she worried for her daughter and good-son. She called on Aemma and as she arrived her daughter smiled at her but Rhaenyra knew it was forced.   “How are you doing my sweet girl? I see you have been distant from your husband lately?” asked the queen.   Aemma froze for a second. “ We are doing fine Muna . He is busy with his lordly duties and I have been too worried about Grandmother… Kepa has also worried me stating that we are at a considerable disadvantage now that we have lost Meleys.”   Rhaenyra hummed but was still unsure. “Don’t worry. We discussed how we will look for … dragon seeds those who have the blood of the dragon outside our family.”   “I guess but I just worry how loyal they will stay with us after they claim a dragon” explained Aemma hoping her mother would buy into her worries and not ask more questions.  “We would have to wait and see… but are you sure you are doing okay?” Rhaenyra asked trying to see through her daughter’s shell.   Aemma bit her lip; she had been emotional these past few weeks but didn’t need to worry her mother. Her mother has a war to win against Aegon.   Aemma gave her a small smile and decided to lie again: “I have just been having some nightmares lately. They… they are of grandmother dying …and of Luke.” Technically Aemma was not lying to her mother. Even though she tried to sleep she couldn’t. Those nightmares along with others made her afraid to sleep. She hated feeling helpless.   Rhaenyra’s heart broke “Oh my pearl have you told your husband? Maybe he-”   “He knows and he does his best… but I also don’t want to exhaust him… don’t worry I am drinking some tea to help.” Aemma quickly lied not wanting to talk about Benjicot; it was still too raw.   Rhaenyra nodded but couldn’t help but think there was something else. She wouldn’t pry though knowing how much she hated in her youth to be constantly bothered to speak when you didn’t.   Aemma said “I will see you at this evening’s feast Mother.”   Rhaenyra smiled as she saw her daughter leave feeling helpless.   As Aemma walked towards her tent she bumped into Aly. Who stated how much she missed her; Alysanne gasped at seeing Aemma’s appearance. She looked like a wilting flower. Aemma tried to ease Aly’s worries and when she asked if Benji knew she had to use all her might not to cry. Aemma tried to soothe Alysanne’s concerns as she excused herself not seeing Alysanne tracking watching her enter her tent and not into Benji’s. Aly’s eyes creased with worry for her good-niece.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Even though Aemma and Benjicot sat beside each other at the feast they ignored each other. Aemma wanted to eat her meal quickly to excuse herself but when she tried the Mutton she wanted to gag. It tasted horrible to her and the smell was overpowering. She glanced at the feast and saw everyone enjoying and joking around; no one seemed to mind the food like she did. Once another wave of nausea hit her she told one of the maids to tell her mother she needed to be excused. She quietly stood and quickly walked out of the feast.   Unbeknownst to her Benjicot was staring as she left. He sighed and turned back to his food not feeling the mood of the feast when two lads jumped him from behind. Oscar and Kermit Tully had arrived and jostled him around causing the lord to chuckle a bit. Oscar and Kermit began pestering him about his wedding and asking where his lovely princess was.   Kermit jokingly stated “With a princess that beautiful he probably has her locked up so no other men can stare at her!”   Causing Benjicot to grow cold his hands tightening around his spoon. Oscar noticed his friend’s mood and stated it was only a jest. Benjicot nodded before he stood tensely walking out of the feast. Alysanne soon followed but she took a different route not wanting to let him know of her presence yet. When she passed the princess’s tent she heard the sounds of throwing up and the handmaidens asking the princess to call a healer. Aly worried rushed in and saw the princess on the floor throwing up in a bucket. Alysanne ran to the princess telling the maid to get a healer as she helped Aemma. Aemma tried to push her away but Aly would not budge.   As the healer arrived she began accessing the princess and asking her numerous questions. Aemma gave her symptoms and how she couldn’t sleep worrying Aly more. Aly asked the healer if she knew what was causing this.   The healer wondered “When was your last moon blood my princess?”   Aemma and Aly gasped Aemma feeling her heart drop as she remembered it was three weeks before her wedding. The Healer nodded and announced that the princess was expecting but before Aly could rejoice the healer told the princess that because she was frail right now her body was at high risk of losing the babe. Aemma closed her eyes in despair; she was failing at her duty…   Aly asked what could help the princess making the healer respond.   “Whatever is causing you heartache or deep unrest princess I suggest you fix it soon not only for your own health but that of your babe’s my princess.” The healer excused herself leaving the room.   Alysanne looked at Aemma who started fidgeting with her rings. Aly sat beside her and pleaded with her about what was happening and why she was so stressed. Aemma finally broke down in tears explaining the green box the note the argument and the explanation she wanted to give her nephew but he always tried to evade her. So she had given up trying to speak to him; now she needed to worry about her baby making sure she could at least perform her duty to her husband. Alysanne embraced the princess as she grew angry; yes the princess should have told Benjicot sooner but for her nephew to just push away his wife not only was he risking his relationship with their allies but with the health of his wife and unborn child. Alysanne stayed with Aemma until the princess tired herself out. Once she saw her sleeping Aly left to scold her nephew.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  “Why am I finding out that you have pushed your wife away from you?” shouted Alysanne scaring Benjicort from his place.   “What?” he asked confused.   Aly’s nose flared as she repeated her question. Benjicot frowned and told his aunt she didn’t fully understand. This made Alysanne more upset. She stated that she knew everything and while she could understand the betrayal it was not severe to just push the princess away. Benjicot sighed saying that they just needed time away from each other to think about what they wanted their marriage to be. Alysanne became furious.   “Now I know this isn’t about her not telling you; this is about you being self-conscious about your position as her husband. Knowing that other men find her attractive makes you scared you are going to lose her. Well my nephew if you were going to be one of those paranoid men then maybe you shouldn’t have married a beautiful Valyrian princess. There will always be men lusting over her. Do you not think Ser Leanor or Prince Daemon knew about that with the Queen? But they understood their wife’s beauty and didn’t let that stop them from loving their wife. But the second you find out a stupid man holds delusions of a stupid childhood. You give up on your marriage! Have you seen your wife she…. She’s struggling Ben and you… you don’t see her fading away.” ranted Aly tears streaming down her face remembering what Aemma looked like.   Benjicot was shocked; he knew his aunt was right about why he and Aemma fought. He wasn’t truly upset at Aemma for not telling him but more concerned that she would one day realize he wasn’t the best husband for her and leave. But hearing that she was struggling made Benji want to wallow in guilt. Was he genuinely ignoring her that he did not notice?   Alysanne knew that she had finally made a breakthrough: ” Please at least talk to her… let her explain fully…she’s … sick Benjicot and your strained relationship with her is only harming her more.” Lying about being sick and not telling him about the pregnancy was princess news to bear.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The next day Benjicot walked to Aemma’s tent. Going in he saw her face. Her cheekbones started showing sunken and she had dark undereye circles. His heart broke; he was the cause of this; as much as he wanted to lay in bed with her fully acknowledging how much he missed her he couldn’t. Walking out he left to train feeling the need to blow away some steam imagining all the practice dummies to be a certain green king.   As Aemma woke up she noticed her breakfast was laid out but already cold. A maid told her mother had just left not wishing to disturb the princess from sleeping. Aemma nodded as she remembered the healer’s and Aly’s words from last night. Reignited with fire she decided: after spending time with Sliverwing she would find her husband make him listen and for their babe’s sake have a cordial marriage if they could not have a fierce love one.   Walking to her dragon she could hear steel hitting something with intensity. As she turned she saw her husband hitting the dummies with vicious and precise force. Aemma sharply inhaled; he looked handsome fully acknowledging how much she had missed him. She walked towards him stopping a few feet away and waiting a second before speaking.   “Good morrow my lord” she spoke lightly watching as he tensed up before turning to meet her gaze. His eyes were storming as he breathed heavily from the intense training.   There was a moment of silence as both stared watching the other with only the sound of a breeze.   “Be- My lord I was hoping you could spare a few minutes for an audience with me?” asked Aemma.   Benjicot cringed internally; they had not used their proper titles since the first night they met. Nodding he walked down a path away from prying eyes as he sat on the grass seeing how she struggled to sit down causing a new wave of guilt to come over him.   Aemma sat beside her husband as she asked for her fire to return to her. She could do this… for her babe.   “I want to explain everything; I’m asking you to please listen until the very end…” pleaded Aemma waiting until Benjicot nodded to continue.   “When my family and I still lived in the red keep this was when I was eight name days old Aegon and I were watching our brothers train; he was talking about how his mother was talking about future marriages with him and how he did not want that. I took pity on him and joked about how we could marry each other to which he agreed. He asked for a kiss to seal and I was a naive girl so I gave him a chaste kiss. I would have no idea if he actually took this as a promise. As I grew older and heard how he was treating the servant girls and my aunt Heleana I decided to withdraw from him and Aemond who is another whole situation. I have never really loved him; I will never love him. How could I love a man like him who takes things that don’t belong to him who ruins someone’s happiness? Who would gladly celebrate kin slaying? How can he compare to you a brave fighter who takes responsibility for his family and people? Someone who has a kind heart hidden in layers of a solider. I have never had someone make me feel safe and loved like you have. You are easy to fall in love with and I will gladly rip my heart for you to prove how much my heart belongs to you and not Aegon. I will gladly die for you. I know I broke your trust and may never win it back and if you feel you cannot love me back then I ask… I ask that we may be cordial with each other… for the sake of the babe.” ranted Aemma looking down not wanting to see his reactions.   Benjicot gasped and stared at his wife’s still flat belly… a babe… a child was growing in her body. This filled him with more guilt; he left her alone. She found out by herself and was willing to not have a loving relationship in her thoughts all for the babe. Benji shakenly reached out and raised her chin pressing his forehead to hers.   “A babe…” We are going to have a babe?” asked Benjicot as Aemma looked into his eyes and nodded. Benji took a second before he continued “ I—I just hate that he thinks you belong to him…” Benji whispered to her.   Aemma reached out and caressed his cheek. “I will never belong to him. I pledged my love to you before the Old Gods and the Fourteen Flames. My heart and soul belong to you and you alone. We made a blood bond; no other person will exist for me.”   Benjicot kissed her hand “How is the babe?”   Once Aemma heard the question she faltered and turned away. Benjicot turned her back to him reminding him of when she had done the same to him. “Aemma we promised not to lie to each other…please”. Benjicot pleaded with her as he noticed her taking a shaken breath.   Aemma turned with tears in her eyes “I’m at risk of losing the babe…. But I promise I will do my best to do my duty as your wife. House Blackwood will have a-”   Benji kissed her cutting her off “Fuck duty I will not lose you over a babe. If the gods wish to bless us they will provide another babe but they cannot give me another Aemma.”   Aemma sobbed as she kissed him back; she had missed him so much. After sharing a sweet kiss they stood Benji leading his princess to their tent.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  From the tent there were faint gasps moans and grunts… with whispers of ‘I love you’s. Aemma lay in the arms of her husband sleeping soundly as Benji stared at his wife’s naked and flat stomach. Their babe was growing inside there and he almost lost them both to Aegon’s fault. He now understood Rhaenyra’s and Aemma’s reasoning; in their delusions the Greens will always hurt others to get what they deem theirs. They don’t love; they just take and ruin. They nearly destroyed his marriage but Benjicot now knew better. He would fight for his love and family as his Aemma did. Then as Benji pulled his dragon princess closer to him kissing her he made a promise the next time he saw that green drunken whoremonger king there will be a sword slicing through his fat stomach.,2024-07-10 01:39:10 GMT

That doesn’t mean it was flawless but it got me up off the couch gasping out loud and shouting “no” at the screen which is a pretty good indicator I was emotionally moved by it. And really an emotional investment in these characters and these stories is all I’m asking for here. Well… that and cool dragons. Because dragons you know?

Renva found Daemon by the painted table she didn’t miss the look of relief on his face when she alerted him that Rhaenyra was alive but alone while mourning the death of their daughter. Daemon wasted no time in rushing to Rhaenyra’s side. Renva walked out of the painted table room and once she made sure she was alone in the hall she collapsed to the floor in tears. The events of the day finally caught up to her. The loss of her father the loss of the King and then finally the loss of the babe who was all Rhaenyra and Renva would talk about.   “My love what is wrong? Is it my mother?” Renva looked up to see Jacaerys round the corner along with Lucerys. Both boys had concern in their eyes for the girl.   “No my sweet. However the babe was born sleeping. Your mother wanted to be alone while she prepared Visenya to be put to rest. She wanted me to inform you and if you wanted to say your goodbyes to her in private that she is in her chambers. Daemon is most likely there now.” Renva wiped her tears away and put on her brave face for the two boys. She knew that they would take the loss deeply due to their caring nature. Now wasn’t the time to inform them of the loss of her father. Not when there were more pressing matters than her own loss at hand. “Go to her I will be okay. I need to wash up anyway.” Renva noted that she had blood on her from helping Rhaenyra.   Once the boys were out of sight she let the tears begin to fall again silently as she walked to her and Jacaerys’ shared chambers. As she entered she saw Ceria already preparing her evening clothes. The sight of Renva must’ve given Ceria a clue as to what Renva needed as she rushed out and returned moments later with a basin of water to fill the tub with. After a few trips to get water. She finally filled the tub and helped Renva out of her garments and into the tub. As Renva dipped her body in the water she allowed the warmth to swallow her and for the first time that day she felt at peace in the warmth of the water. Ceria couldn’t help but notice that Renva’s attitude had in fact begun to change.   A few hours had passed and now Renva stood next to Jacaerys holding his hand tightly as they watched Rhaenyra and Daemon walk up towards the pyre. In Rhaenyra’s arms was a bundle of white fabric that held the remains of the Princess Visenya II. Hearing a rustle behind her Renva glanced back to see Erryk Cargyll approaching in his Kings Guard armor. Daemon turned hearing the noise also those who joined the Queens Guard drew their weapons as Erryk approached.   “I mean no harm brothers” Erryk got down on one knee and pulled the late King Viserys crown from his satchel. “I swear to ward the Queen with all my strength and give my blood for hers. I shall take no wife hold no lands father no children. I shall guard her secrets obey her commands ride at her side and defend her name and honor.” Erryk lifted his head as Daemon approached him. Daemon lifted the crown out of his hands and walked back towards Rhaenyra. Rhaenyra bowed her head ever so slightly to allow Daemon to place her fathers crown upon her head. The onlookers wasted no time in dropping to their knees to show their respect for their Queen.   —  Renva tended to avoid the Painted table room as much as she could the days following the death of Visenya and Visaerys. She found solitude in her bed chambers. She would still break fast with the family however many noted that she was more reserved than normal. Jacaerys couldn’t even figure out what was going on with his wife. He would ask if everything was okay and he would be met with the same response of ‘I’m well my love. Do not worry about me.’ along with a kiss to his cheek before she would continue what she was doing.    However today Renva wasn’t able to avoid said room Rhaenyra wanted the whole family gathered there that day and Renva was not about to refuse her Queen. Renva’s attention wasn’t on the conversation instead it was at where she was picking at her nails or the seams of her gown. She would pick up pieces of the conversation as they were talking about what allies they would have to support Rhaenyras claim to the throne.   “And what of House Stark? Do we have the support of Lord Rickon and the North?” Renvas attention was drawn to Daemon as he stared at her waiting for her to respond to his question.   “Of course. However I received news the day of the late Visenyas’ funeral that my father had passed. But my brother Cregan assured me in the letter that no matter what he shall uphold the promise made to support the rightful heir you your grace. There has never been a Stark to forget an oath. ” Renva said as she looked at Rhaenyra. The room grew quiet after hearing Renvas words and all eyes turned to look at her. “And why exactly have you waited to bring this to our attention. Do you have ulterior motives?” Daemon spoke with spite at Renva. She was taken aback at the sudden accusation.  “Never. There was just so much going on and bigger things were at hand I-” Renva was cut off by Rhaenyra.   “We shall send envoys to the North and to Storm’s end to carry my message.” Renva looked towards the Queen who wouldn’t even meet her eye. The same person who she helped through childbirth and consoled when her own husband wasn’t by her side.   “We should bear those messages Dragons can fly faster than ravens and are more convincing. Send us.” Renva’s body went cold when she heard the voice beside her speak up. She couldn’t stomach the conversation anymore and bolted out of the room and ran to her chamber. She emptied the contents of her stomach into a chamberpot as she heard the door reopen behind her. Renva felt her hair be held up by someone.  “My lady you are okay. I am here.” Renva’s body calmed at hearing Ceria’s voice.   .·:*¨༺ ༻¨*:·.  next chapter,2024-07-10 02:59:25 GMT

The two have been performing their marital duties everynight to ensure an heir is produced. It was calm in Dragonstone The newlyweds would wake up and break fast with the rest of the family Renva would joke with Baela and Rhaena. The three became quickly inseparable they would travel to the libraries after breaking fast in the mornings and read for an hour. Then they would separate Renva going to Signe and Baela going to Moondancer Rhaena decided to follow around Daemon and Rhaenyra and learn more about politics. Cregan had left four days after the wedding following the news that Lord Stark had fallen ill. Cregan wanted to make sure his sister was settled before leaving her and returning to Winterfell.   Renva was currently taking a walk along the beach with Signe the direwolf choosing to stay more inland than her counterpart. The ocean calmed Renva it’s not like they had one in Winterfell but the crashing of the waves reminded her of the gentle snow storms that plagued the north during the winter. Renva bent down to pick up a shell when she heard a screech. Spending the last two weeks on Dragonstone she picked up on the dragon’s calls. This was one she hadn’t heard before. Glancing up towards the sky she saw a magnificent red dragon with copper like horns descend near the beach allowing its rider to disembark from its back. Renvas hand ghosted over the dagger she held with her at all times she knew about the tension between the queen to be and what Daemon deemed as ‘the greens’. As the figure approached the gate of the castle Renva noticed it was the Queen who never was.   Trailing behind her at a distance Renva made her way towards the painted table room where Rhaenyra and Daemond were talking.   “Princess Rhaenys Targaryen.” Sir Lorent announced Rhaenys presence unbeknownst to the others in the room Renva waited outside the chamber. She too assumed Rhaenys was here to bring news about the Lord of Driftmark’s health but it turned out that it was something much worse entirely.  “Viserys is dead.” Renva’s hand shot to her mouth to hold in her gasp. “I grieve this loss with you Rhaenyra. My cousin your father possessed a kind heart.” It was quiet for a moment Renva thought the worst was now over but in general Targaryen fashion there was always something else. “  “There is more. Aegon has been crowned as his successor.” Renva heard a wince of pain from the true heir before she spoke “They crowned him?” Daemon took his chance to speak since it grew silent. “How did Viserys die?” Renva took this as her chance to leave the scene to find somewhere to run. She knew that Jacaerys would be informed but she didn’t know how long till then. She thought it best to give him space until he sought comfort in her.   She found herself in the library a place that brought her comfort. No matter where she was in the world a library provided her with the same thing freedom. Freedom to choose what to read but also a way to escape the would that regarded women with very little care. How she missed her father news on his condition wasn’t ever fast enough. Turning to the rows of books she saw one of her favorites that her father would read to her as a child. The cover was the same a wolf that almost looked like it was eating its own tail.   She chose a chair near the fireplace and tucked her feet under her. She was almost a third of the way into the book when she saw Ceria enter the library with a letter.   “Is that news of my father?” Renva shot out of her seat and rushed to meet Ceria.  “I believe it is your grace.” Ceria curtsied and started to turn when Renva lightly grabbed her arm. “Would you please stay with me?” Renva asked in almost a childlike manner. “Of course.”   The two sat in the soft arm chairs as Renva started to shakily open the letter she noticed wet spots on the letter. She knew it could be from the weather but something in her gut told her differently. Renva pulled out the letter and started reading it was Cregan’s handwriting. Her eyes didn’t have to travel far to receive the condition of her father written not even two lines in were the words   ‘I regret to inform you my dear sister but father has passed as of the twelfth day of the tenth moon. When you receive this letter it will be too late for you to attend fathers funeral. But know dear sister you are never far from our hearts. I have been named Lord of Winterfell and I will stand beside you along with the rest of the North. If you need me do not hesitate to come. Sincerely with love Lord Cregan Stark of Winterfell’.  Renva let the letter fall to her feet she didn’t notice she was crying until Ceria pulled out a white handkerchief and wiped her face. “My father is dead.” She whispered out to no one in particular. Renva could feel her heart snap in two however she knew she had to pull it together because while the death of her father was tragic there was a more pressing matter to address. The death of the King. Wiping her tears away she picked up the letter folding it neatly and putting it back in the envelope. She turned to Ceria “You are dismissed Ceria thank you for comforting me but I think it is time I go find my husband.” Renva walked through the halls of the castle but stopped when she heard a painful scream. Following the noise she stumbled across Rhaenyra and a cluster of handmaidens who were begging her to allow them to help. “Out all of you.” Renva said as she entered the chambers and shooed out the staff. She slowly walked towards Rhaenyra who was in a corner covering herself like a wounded animal. Once Renva married Jacaerys she read all about what was to be expected of her. She read books about the development of a babe and how it is best delivered along with complications that could occur. Noting that Rhaenyra was covered in blood and there was still no babe Renva wondered if the babe was possibly stuck or coming out the wrong way. After growing close with Rhaenyra Renva knew that the now Queen would hesitate to send her away if anything.   “Your grace it is me Renva.” Renva held her hands out to the new Queen. Renva slightly jumped when she felt the Queen grab her hands with such force. “I am here you need to push. The babe might be stuck.” Rhaenyra held on tight to Renva as she processed the younger girl’s words. Renva allowed her to squeeze her arms as she pulled Rhaenyra to her knees keeping in mind it was easier to deliver a babe that way. “On three okay?” Rhaenyra nodded “One two” the Queen took a deep breath “three!” Rhaenyra screamed as she pushed. As Renva helped pull the babe out she felt what it was that happened before she saw it. Once Renva pulled the babe up to let it rest in Rhaenyra’s arms both women’s attention shifted from Rhaenyra’s cries of pain to the little body that didn’t cry at all. “It’s Visenya your grace.” Renva whispered out even though her voice felt like it echoed off the walls. The poor babe was covered in what looked like dragon scales with small lumps on her back where wings should be. Renva held Rhaenyra close as the mother cradled her only daughter’s lifeless body and wept.  .·:*¨༺ ༻¨*:·.  next chapter,2024-07-10 02:57:51 GMT

They walked hand in hand down the corridors giggling from the wine they had consumed at the party.   “Have my things been moved already?” Renva asked Jacaerys not knowing if even he knew the answer.   “They have. Many of the handmaidens move your belongings into my chamber during the party.” Jace said starting to grow nervous. “Listen Jace don’t be nervous. We will grow to understand how one another lives and we will form a new rhythm together. As for tonight” Renva took a deep breath before continuing “we just have to perform our duties and then we can forget about it for a while if you’d like.” Renva was just as nervous even more so than Jacaerys due to having just recently been informed of what her duties entail.   It was during their voyage to Dragonstone that Cregan asked Rhaenyra if she could explain what happens from a woman’s perspective on the wedding night. Rhaenyra had no issues informing the young girl who stared at her hands the whole time with wide eyes until Rhaenyra was done speaking. Renva just hoped that it would be as painless as possible and be done with.   The two entered their chambers and got ready for the night. Jace helped Renva take the braids out of her hair being gentle with the ones close to her scalp. Once her braids were all out Jace took a moment to massage her head. It was something he saw his mother do to her own after a long day with tight braids in her hair. Renva melted into Jace’s hand when he did that she hadn’t realized just how much her head hurt. Renva turned towards Jace and noticed that they both still had residual blood on their faces from the ceremony. She called out to Ceria to bring a bucket of water and some rags. Renva then helped Jacaerys out of his ceremony robes placing it on the chair next to them. She found that he too wore a similar colored suit to her dress. It was after Renva’s initiation that they both slowly helped each other declothe until Renva was in her chemise and Jace was in his tunic and trousers.   It was at this time that Ceria had brought in a bucket of warm water and some rags. She placed it next to the fire to try and keep the warmth and slid out of the room. Renva walked towards the bucket and dipped one of the rags in before walking back over towards Jace. Jace watched Renva with careful eyes it was like if he blinked she would be gone and he would wake up from the best dream of his life. Renva carefully wiped his face free from the blood the cut on his lip already having been scabbed over. Jace then himself repeated the same motions to her stilling while wiping a dried trail of blood that dripped from her lip to her chin.   Grabbing the rag from Jace Renva tossed it to where the other dirty ones laid. She noticed how Jace never took his eyes off her since they got to the chamber. Walking back up to Jace she slowly grabbed his hand and pulled him towards the bed. It was in that moment that Jace finally snapped out of whatever daze he seemed to be in he switched the positions so he was leading her towards the bed. Renva noticed her heart started racing as Jacce gestured for her to lay on the bed. To say that she felt awkwards in the moment of her crawling towards the headboard would be an understatement.   Looking down the bed at Jace she couldn’t help but release a small giggle.   “What do I look funny?” Jace said as he looked down upon himself.   “Of course not I just feel silly.” Renva said trying to calm the air. “If it helps you look beautiful from where I am.” Jace said before he too joined Renva on the bed. Renva slowly pulled her undergarments out from under her chemise tossing them to the floor next to the bed doing so she heard Jace suck in a breath at her action. She had a small smile etched onto her face knowing her action will set in motion the rest of the night.   Jace sat on his thighs and removed his tunic Renva followed his sitting motion so they were face to face. While Jace might still be young Renva noticed he was well defined for his age. Renva slowly lifted her chemise off herself fully revealing her bare body to Jacaerys. “You are beautiful Renva.” Jace said taking her all in with his eyes. He hesitantly reached out to touch her “You won’t hurt me. It’s okay.” Renva led his hand to her hip. The self control Jace had slowly slipped as he pulled Renva in towards him and crashed his lips into hers.   The two heatedly kissed as their hands explored one another. They were growing desperate Renva tugging at Jaces trousers Jace running one of his thumbs just under the swell of her breast the other exploring her body.   Jacaerys stripped off his last piece of clothing. Jace then laid Renva down positioning himself above her. Jacaerys planted a chaste kiss on her lips before trailing his mouth down to her neck then to one of her breasts. He made sure to pay attention to both of them his hand fondled the breast his mouth wasn’t on. Renva bucked her hips at the sensation that she never felt before. Jace removed his hand from her breast and trailed it between her legs tapping her thigh when she squeezed her legs shut. Renva allowed for Jace to part her legs his mouth popping off her breast to look at her. Jace made eye contact with Renva as he slid one of his fingers over her folds before it settled on her bud.   As Jace rubbed small circles on her clit he watched as her eyes closed she let out a breathy moan. Jace felt himself leaking precum at the sight. Jace moved down so he was face to face with her cunt. Renva felt his hot breath on her and before she could say anything she felt him start to lick at her folds. Jace lifted one of her legs over his shoulder to give him more access to her. He wasn’t sure if he was doing it correctly but when Renva gripped his hair he assumed she was happy with his work. Renva let out a loud moan as Jace felt her release. He lapped up her juices making sure to leave some to help guide himself into her.   Jace removed her leg from his shoulder sitting on his knees making eye contact with Renva who looked ethereal to him laid out on their bed. “Are you ready?” Jace asked as he stroked himself a few times Renva nodded as she caught her breath. Jace took his cock and slowly rubbed his tip along her folds collecting some of her cum to help guide him. “If it hurts let me know and we shall stop.” Jace spoke out of breath himself. “It’s okay Jace. I’m ready.” Renva said giving Jace the okay. Jace slowly pushed him self into her bracing himself above her with his arm. Renva dug her nails into Jace’s shoulder blades “Keep going Jace.” Renva spoke as she kissed his neck the little pain she felt overcome by pleasure.   Jace bottomed out as Renva arched her back making them both moan into each other’s necks. Jace planted light kisses as he slowly pulled out halfway and pushed back into her. “Jace” Renva moaned “Yes my love?” Jace spoke himself finding it hard to form proper words. “Please go faster.” Renva whimpered into his ear Jace shuddered as a feeling he’s never had before came over him. Jace picked up his pace Renva wrapped her legs around his waist as he continued to slam into her. Renva felt something snap in her as she felt release. Jace felt her squeeze him and it made him only last a few more strokes before he coated her walls. Renva knew their marital duties were complete as she felt him coat her insides with his seed.   “We have done well my prince.” Renva spoke as Jace pulled out and she laid her head on his chest. “I am utterly in love with you Renva.” he spoke into her hair giving it a kiss before pulling the covers over them. The two drift off to sleep in each other’s arms both unaware of what is to come.   .·:*¨༺ ༻¨*:·.  next chapter,2024-07-10 02:56:00 GMT

Aemond glances at Jace who frowns at the sight. Jace wondered why he felt a stinging sensation in his chest when he was asleep. early in the morning he decided to check on Vermax. he finds him curled up alone in his own nest. Vermax is depressed at the loss of his winged brother to the golden dragon of their uncle. this springs Jace to search immediately for his brother. he didn’t think their relationship had taken such a cold turn. yes he’s been busy with his lessons and hasn’t seen Luke at all since they’ve returned to the Keep. he enters Luke’s chambers finding it empty. he frowns and the pain in his chest deepens. it’s not just his dragons depression but it’s also his own sadness threatening to take him down. he curses and decides to look and Aegon’s room. he pushes past an angry Cole and opens Aegon’s door. his little brother sprawled underneath the bed sheets and like the dragons Aegon has protective hold over him. both are soundlessly asleep. he begins to wonder when he started to lose his brother to his uncle’s grasp.,2024-07-10 02:31:52 GMT

I mean I did enjoy how dramatic it was that Aemond was the one to do it because I did not expect that but Rhaenys just died for nothing 😭 They made her whole purpose at Rook’s Rest so pointless because not only was she not the one to maim Aegon but then the show had her and Meleys crush the castle they were there to defend and its people while they fell to their death. Like they could have at least given my girl a little something before killing her by letting her have the accomplishment of defeating Aegon like in the book but instead they gave her absolutely nothing 😞,2024-07-10 03:45:43 GMT

Aegon looked around and smiled “Drinks for all a pleasure from the crown!” As he spoke the patrons erupted into cheers whoops and hollers. He leads his followers to a table patting on a particular squire’s back. “This night is for you!” He cheered along with many other things. The group had been 3 pitchers of wine down once they decided they were fit to head to the brothel. A new squire was joining the Kingsguard a young man named Harrison.  “I still refuse to believe you’ve never bed a woman before squire. Your appearance doesn’t lack” Aegon said motioning to the boy.   “I guess I never really sought it out your Grace” he replied.  ”Bullshit!” He called out taking another drink from his cup of wine. The king pressed him further demanding a more clear response.   “Truly your Grace. I don’t understand the big issue here.”  ”The issue is that I need a Kingsguard full of men. Tonight you shall become one!” Aegon shouted as he stood up. “Come I want to talk as we walk.”  Harrison stood and walked towards the King his followers grinning and snickering at him. “Yes your Grace?” He asked.  Aegon slung his hand over Harrison’s shoulder quickly pulling him in closer. “Tell me what is your type?”   “Well I’m not sure” Harrison said a lump in his throat. “Blonde?”  ”Blonde okay. There’s a couple of fine whores here who are blonde any of them are fine to suit your taste” Aegon said pushing through the doors that lead into another circular floor with a dozen rooms covered with sheer curtains.   “Do you come here often your Grace?” Harrison asked.   “The King doesn’t need to share his secrets with his Kingsguard. Now tell me which would you like?” He asked motioning to an array of women sitting on couches in the center of the room. Blondes brunettes and redheads lay over each other fawning over the King.   “Your Grace as embarrassing as this is to admit none of them are my time.”  The King sat and thought for a moment contemplating. “Do you favor men?” He asked. He couldn’t think of any other reason as to why Harrison wouldn’t give him an answer.  The squire’s face turned red he looked to the floor and back up at his king. “Yes your Grace.”  ”We are in a brothel full of women there is nothing for you here.”  ”Yes” he affirms.   Aegon thought to himself and smiled. “Come.”  He grabbed Harrison’s arm and pulled him towards a room shutting the curtains as they entered.  ”Your Grace what is the meaning of this?” Harrison asked. He stood in the middle of the room. It was fairly empty with nothing except a bed and a nightstand in the corner.   ”You said you favored men” he began. “The King doesn’t share his secrets with his Kingsguard.” He slurred slightly as he spoke his hair pushed behind his ears exposing his features.  Harrison swallowed tightly looking at the King. “Are you insinuating you and I…?”  ”Why are you acting so surprised?” Aegon asked he stood in front of the shorter man and pushed him lightly so he fell back onto the bed. “Did you not think your King swung your way?”  ”No your Grace.”  ”I would hope not” he smiled. He started to slide off his coat dropping it to the floor and doing the same with his pants. ”Take your clothes off.” He instructed.  Harrison nodded quickly fumbling with his coat buttons and eventually getting it off following suit with his pants. The both of them sat there with nothing but their undergarments on. Harrison felt awkward almost hiding himself from the King’s gaze.   “Why do you hide yourself?” Aegon asked untying his underwear’s laces and dropping them. His cock sprung twitching slightly from meeting the cold air. “Come closer.” He commanded.   Harrison scooted closer to the edge of the bed his cock begging to be set free from his underwear.   He looked shocked at the King’s member the size intimidating. Aegon positioned himself in front of Harrison’s mouth smiling. “Open”  Harrison opened his mouth staring up at Aegon as he shoved his cock into Harrison’s mouth. His eyes widened slightly trying to adjust to the feeling.   Aegon started to move his hips placing his hand on the back of Harrison’s head. “Even your mouth is perfect isn’t it? Fuck” he gasped.   Harrison refocused beginning to bob his head in rhythm with Aegon’s hips. He swirled his tongue around Aegon’s cock sucking on the tip causing the King to let out a loud moan.   “You’re doing such a good job keep going” Aegon said throwing his head back as Harrison hollowed his cheeks and bobbed his head faster.  Harrison felt the twitch on his tongue as he began to go faster. Aegon gripped his hair tightly as he began to thrust harder and harder reaching his climax.   Aegon felt his knot burst releasing threads of cum into Harrison’s mouth. His legs shook as he stood releasing moans he didn’t think he’d ever made before.   Aegon pulled his cock free the tip flushed red. “Are you sure you have never done that before?” He asked Harrison looking down.  Harrison stared up at him trying to swallow the cum in his mouth. His brown curls stuck to his face. Cum dripped from his lips as he shook his head no. “No your Grace” he said wiping his face with the back of his hand. “Are you satisfied?”   “More than” Aegon said. He contemplated for a moment before speaking. “Get on your back.”  Harrison swallowed nodding. He scooted back further on the bed lying down. “What do you plan to do your Grace?”   Aegon grabbed Harrison’s underwear and yanked them off. “Let’s get rid of these yeah?” Aegon said. He lifted Harrison’s legs and rested them on his shoulders. “You’re eager aren’t you?”   Harrison flushed as Aegon grabbed his face shoving his fingers into his mouth. “Suck.”  Harrison did just that sucking hard. After a few moments Aegon pulled his fingers free then positioned them at Harrison’s entrance. “This might hurt a little” he said shoving his middle finger into his hole moving in and out slowly.   As he did this Harrison gasped and bucked his hips from the sudden pressure. “A little?” He stuttered out his mouth hanging open slightly moaning as Aegon shoved another finger in.  ”You little whore. You love it don’t you?” Aegon asked grinning. Harrison nodded quickly.  He grinned spitting into his hand. He pumped his cock a few times pushing his tip into Harrison slowly. He watched as the younger man gasped rolling his eyes back.   Aegon pushed further his thighs clenching as his cock was being squeezed. “You’re so tight” he commented.  Harrison was a mumbling mess he felt a mixture of both euphoria and pain as Aegon moved his hips faster. “Faster please Aegon” he whined legs shaking. Aegon grinned grabbing Harrison’s cock in his hand and pumping it quickly quickening the pace of his hips as he did so.   They were both a moaning mess Harrison’s eyes brimming with tears of pleasure. “I’m going to cum” he whined. “Please don’t stop” he cried out. His back arched and his legs shook as Aegon pumped his cock and moved in and out of him.  Aegon grinned. “You can cum it’s alright” he assured. Watching the man under him crumble and shake at his whim aroused him to a new height. He felt the cock in his hand twitch and heard Harrison let out a cry as he came spurts of cum covering his hand.   “Aegon” Harrison whined bucking his hips and riding out his orgasm. “Oh my god.” Aegon continued to pump his cock causing Harrison to form tears and beg for him to stop.  Aegon’s orgasm followed suit he thrusted his hips faster his cock twitching and filling Harrison with his cum. He collapsed onto Harrison’s chest breathing heavily. “It has been too long since I’ve been with a man. I’ve missed it.” Aegon said into Harrisons’ chest his cock sliding out and cum spilling.  “I’m glad I could be of service my King.”  “You keep up with the formality like I didn’t just fuck you squire.”  “Is there an issue with that? I assumed you liked being referred to by your proper title” Harrison replied throwing his arm around Aegons back. His legs shook as his cock rubbed against Aegons stomach.   “You can call me by my name.”  “If you insist.”,2024-07-10 04:55:25 GMT

35,House of the Dragon,['hotd season 2'  'hotd'  'rhaenyra targaryen'  'queen rhaenyra'  'hotd spoilers'  'song of ice and fire'],f4th0usecat,i see alot of edits/posts concerning about rhaenyra’s sudden shift of character from being this young ‘badass’ teenage girl to being a fully grown woman. saying that they’re entirely two different people when in reality rhaenyra has just grown to be a mother.  and i see nothing wrong with that(despite the heaps of disappointment that floods in me with her decision-making in this season) i’m excited to see her crack. i dont expect to see her younger rebellious self shine again as soon as possible but rather i like the build up of anticipation to see that one particular &#x27;snap’.  people might say that it should’ve happened the moment she lost her second son(lucerys velaryon). but i think it’s an interesting direction to see her grieve and mourn to see her vulnerable and still have that hope for peace.   she is still her father’s daughter afterall.,2024-07-10 04:35:09 GMT

You’re gonna look me in the eyes and tell me Aegon wouldn’t love being the pretty kept boy to his queen and absolutely refuse to be anything but arm candy while Rhaenyra ruled? Literally all she’d have to do is give him a smidge of affection and he’d fold like a deck of cards.   Oh the lords think he should be in charge? Too bad he’s just here to drink wine and look pretty.   Everything with Harwin and later Daemon? Cannot tell me that not only would he not care he’d be so down to get in the middle of that like Rhaenyra wouldn’t even need to ask he’s stripping off immediately.  The guy didn’t even want to be King but arm candy to a Queen that pegs him on a near daily basis and actually treats him well? You could not stop him from sprinting down that aisle I will never believe otherwise,2024-07-10 04:33:52 GMT

It makes me so happy! ❤️  &lt;!-- more --&gt; 𝐒𝐀𝐋𝐓𝐘 𝐊𝐈𝐒𝐒𝐄𝐒 𝐏𝐄𝐏𝐏𝐄𝐑𝐄𝐃 𝐘𝐎𝐔𝐑 𝐂𝐇𝐄𝐄𝐊𝐒 harkened in from the gentle roll of the tides. Saltwater and dampened rock filled your nostrils aided by the fluttering breeze as it danced across the obsidian cliffs of Dragonstone.   The castle stood the testament of time a monolith to the rule of the Targaryens. It loomed overhead less frightening in the lighter hours blanketed by glittering rays of sunlight. A cloudless day — good for sailing you thought as vessels ushered in goods to the shoddy harbor below.  Beneath the vibrancy of a cloudless sky you could see the shadow of a dragon soaring overhead — the Princess Rhaenys from the horned shape above. You cupped your hand around your eyes squinting to see constantly mesmerized by such creatures.  In your fantastical dreams you flew upon the back of a dragon letting the wind scrape across your visage feeling the weight of something so powerful beneath you. Of course you were neither Targaryen nor Velaryon — possessing a dragon wouldn’t be in the cards for you and perhaps that was a good thing.   As much as you enjoyed the beauty of Dragonstone you much preferred the outdoors. The weather was splendid and you took small victories wherever possible. With war on the horizon between your Queen Rhaenyra and her usurper brother any chance at happiness was worth chasing after and holding onto while you could.  House Celtigar had bent the knee to Rhaenyra and your father sat at her council. You were made to be a lady-in-waiting much your initial disdain. The station you held would’ve been considered a great honor to most young women but you were inclined to be out in the ocean or on the back of a horse.   Now you found enjoyment in it wherever you could.  Oceanic air filled your lungs in a singular inhale tinged with a saltwater sting. You stood near one of the many stone terraces lining the lengthy walkway to the castle’s entrance accompanied by Joffrey. The boy had become your greatest joy amidst the brewing chaos and you were rather grateful for it.  “Would you like to see the ocean little Prince?” You held the boy’s hand stooping down to wrap your arms beneath him standing him up along the cobbled bannister. Joffrey’s laughter could brighten a whole room and it did — it certainly lifted your spirits.  “When will I be able to ride a dragon?” He questioned pointing towards the shape of Meleys in the sky. Joffrey was rather inquisitive — a sharp mind one that would become a great leader someday.   You were unsure of how to answer such a question. Tyraxes was young and still small just like Joffrey. “Whenever you grow up” You hummed a smile playing at either corner of your mouth. “You must be as tall as your brother first.”   Joffrey toyed with the wooden dragon clutched between his hands gaze falling toward the ground. “Luke wasn’t much taller.” He mumbled and it nearly crushed your heart completely to hear the confusion and despair in a child’s voice.   Youth knew more than most and in the mind of a child something heinous could appear innocent or something tragic was beyond their comprehension. Joffrey knew that Luke was gone — he wasn’t coming back. Silence drifted between the both of you and you found it difficult to change the subject from Lucerys to something lighthearted.   “I miss him.” Joffrey’s sweet voice rang out like the pealing of bells crystal-clear and downtrodden. You turned him around within your grasp keeping your hands slotted underneath his arms to ground him. His eyes swam with unshed tears prompting you to bring him into your embrace.  “It’s alright my Prince. He’s still here” You whispered hugging the boy as tightly as you could. It was enough to rip at your heartstrings tear you asunder as melancholy began to eat you alive. The fate of Lucerys was a tragic one — unfair and unwarranted and now a catalyst for destruction between kin. “We will remember him.”  From afar Jacaerys observed you and his brother standing along the ramparts with a palm atop the pommel of his shortsword. The emotional turmoil he continued to feel in regards to Lucerys happened to swell the moment he saw Joffrey clinging onto you — and he knew.   Wisps of a tempered breeze stirred his curled tresses drifting across his regalia as it caught against his cloak. After the death of his brother he had come out to the ramparts nearly every night to sob and to curse the world to pray to any God that would listen — return Lucerys bring him home. He had lost count and in turn lost a bit of faith.  Remaining optimistic in the face of unavoidable danger was a difficult thing — fear had gripped him once but no longer. He knew that the only time a man could be brave was in situations like these where terror stared him in the face and dared him to submit.   Many still referred to him as a mere boy with little experience and no real understanding of the world and its cruelty. Jacaerys had shed the raiment of boyhood the night he flew blindly into the darkness in the name of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen.  With the man born he knew that whatever would come next he was prepared to face such challenges head-on. Brazenness was not in his nature but he had learned to adopt stoicism when it mattered most. It was easy to shed the facade around his family and around you.   His friendship with you was a calm within the storm a lull in the tempestuous hurricane you were all trapped within. You now had as much stake in this game as he did — your father served on Rhaenyra’s council with Celtigar bannerman pledging to fight in the war to come and you served as his mother’s lady-in-waiting.  Your blossoming bond was a great comfort and the tender way in which you cared for Joffrey was a wonderful thing. You had a soft heart — a good heart and that was something rare to come by. The two of you were both of a similar feather and the admiration he held for you only seemed to grow stronger each day.   The word friendship often tormented him on days where you wore beautiful gowns and stood beside his mother or whenever you smiled. It tormented him when you held Joffrey within your arms and protected him just as fiercely as Rhaenyra would.   Honor demanded that he simply remain just that — a friend but Jacaerys found himself smitten with you in a way that transcended propriety. To cross that line especially with you invited the disdain of his mother and the ire of your father amongst other things.  Betrothal would be upon him soon enough likely with a young maiden from the Vale or the Reach to secure an alliance but it left a sour taste within his mouth. He had little desire to be with anyone else when you were right there.  Jacaerys steeled himself abandoning his whimsical line of thinking in regards to you. It was a fool’s errand and he couldn’t afford to be a fool. He stepped closer the crunch of stone resonating underneath his boots as he approached you and Joffrey.  “My Lady” Jacaerys’s tone was amiable like the comforting lick of a warm hearth. His gaze flickered toward Joffrey bemused with his brother’s antics as you balanced him along the bannister. “What are you doing up there?” He asked playful in the presence of his little brother.   “Flying” Joffrey’s head lifted from your shoulder eyes sparkling with mischief. You happened to carry him in such a way that he called it flying — and he was asking you to do it again. “Flying!”  With a giggle you picked the boy up swinging him up enough to let him get some air. His melancholy turned to jovial laughter as you soared him over to Jacaerys who was more than happy to pick him up. Joffrey clung to Jace hugging his brother with all of his strength.  “You are getting too big to fly” Jace mused holding Joffrey in one arm as he motioned for you to accompany him. His tousled curls and amicable smile sent your heart fluttering as it had many times before. It wasn’t subtle your liking of Jacaerys but you understood the nature of your affections. “Big enough for Tyraxes soon.”  Jacaerys was perfect with all of the hallmarks of what a true King should be. He was gentle and eloquent honed with a blade learned — and above all he was kind. The rage that plagued him now was justified and it pained you to see him become coiled with anger but you understood why.   As Joffrey regaled the two of you with tales of childlike wonder soaring his toy dragon around Jace’s head Jacaerys seemed inclined to converse with you regardless. “I always know where to look whenever I need to see you.” He mused walking alongside you as you made your way up the ramparts.  “Is that so?” You chuckled head canting to one side. “What did you need to see me for your Grace?” It was a force of habit — he was the heir to the Iron Throne after all. Jacaerys regarded you with a brief laugh knowing that formalities were often abandoned whenever the two of you were together.  “Do I need a reason?” Jacaerys mused voice light and inviting. The crash of the tide upon the beach provided a rather serene ambience accompanied by the calling of gulls as they circled the bay.   You shook your head skirts gathered in one hand as you narrowly avoided an upturned plate of stone. “Of course not” You hesitated gaze sparkling as your nose wrinkled in mild amusement. “Jacaerys.” You ensured to exaggerate his name allowing for your conversation to become personal.  At the end of the ramparts a flock of crimson-clad handmaidens awaited your return. It was likely that they were waiting for you to hand Joffrey over much to your dismay. The black-headed boy looked to you as you neared the end of your walk.  “I don’t want to go” He protested reaching for you as you stepped forward taking a hold of his hand. “When can we fly again?” Joffrey asked lower lip jutting out in a rather innocuous pout. He leaned forward partially out of Jace’s grasp to give you a hug.  “Tomorrow my Prince. I will let you fly as much as you’d like.” You assured him reciprocating his hug with one of your own with all of the warmth one could muster. It was motherly in-nature and you watched as Jacaerys planted him onto solid ground.   Joffrey took the outstretched hand of a handmaiden glancing back at you and Jacaerys before they disappeared behind the castle’s massive gates. It always hurt you to leave him but you knew that tomorrow would come swiftly. A begrudging sigh escaped you before you looked at Jacaerys countenance somber.  Jace knew what you were about to say — something about Lucerys. The gaping wound left within his heart was barely healed still oozing with pain but he was making every effort to mend it. You helped — your resolute reassurance and shoulder to lean on but sometimes it wasn’t enough.  Instead you reached for Jace’s forearm giving it a brief squeeze of comfort. Whatever sentiments he held you seemed to echo it leaving it all unspoken. You and Jacaerys had already spoken about it all at-length — sometimes he had little desire to tear himself open again.   His head hung low heap of dark curls billowing in the wind. Jacaerys’s jaw tightened for a brief moment and he imagined plunging his sword into Aemond Targaryen’s other eye — and then it passed just as quickly as it had appeared.   A forlorn silence settled between the both of you one that was born out of mutual understanding and empathy. Jace went quiet often and you were content to sit in it for as long as he pleased. Instead you stepped toward the bannister palms planting themselves atop the stone as you gazed out toward the land surrounding Dragonstone.   “You are good with him” Jacaerys broke the silence deliberately stepping towards you as he stood by your side. Joffrey and his half-brothers Aegon and Viserys were all he had left. He would die for them if he had to. “He talks about you often.”   An exuberant smile crept onto your features one of a sweet fondness in regards to Joffrey. “He is a sweet boy — very sharp-witted though. I would imagine he will grow to be very wise.” You replied idly tracing your fingers around some of the rocks socketed into the bannister.  “I remember the day he was born” Jacaerys recalled remembering the day that his mother pale skin glistening with sweat had wobbled into the drawing room a newborn Joffrey in her arms. “It was a beautiful day and Ser Harwin was there and Ser Laenor …” He trailed off recalling the way that Lucerys had begged to hold his younger brother.   The topic of both Laenor and Harwin were bitter ones — both men playing the role of father. Jacaerys loved them both as any son would. Another gust of saltwater mist brushed along the ramparts dusting your cheeks with wisps of moist air.   Wordlessly you reached for Jace’s arm looping yours around him as you let him lean against you for support. As much as Jacaerys insisted that he would recover and move on you ensured him that grieving took time — it came in many shapes and forms.  Jace’s smile was wistful and threadbare made sorrowful by memories of Lucerys. He didn’t want to sully the moment with his melancholy holding his head high as he glanced toward you. You were not looking but it allowed him a moment of appreciation and admiration.   Your beauty was unparalleled your features delicate and smile like the warmth of a summer sunshine. The way in which you carried yourself was of a kindly disposition made to be nurturing and helpful instead of imposing. Admittedly you took his breath away — the feeling was a constant one.   Sunlight sparkled across your countenance gaze soothing and full of empathy. The way in which you grasped his arm kept yourself tucked away within his side it invoked feelings of protectiveness — and newfound affection.  A dragon’s shrill cry reverberated throughout the skies prompting Jacaerys to immediately look ahead. It was the familiar shriek of Vermax his bonded dragon who had grown exponentially. He was larger than Moondancer with olive-colored scales and orange fins eyes the color of a burnished gold.  “Māzigon Vermax!” Jacaerys called gaining the attention of his dragon as it began to approach causing your heart to gallop within your chest. He looked at you with a hint of amusement head canting to one side. “Would you like to see him?” Jace inquired moving along the wall.  As majestic as dragons were the wonder within your eyes had quickly shifted to wariness as it landed along the ramparts rocks scraping underneath its talons. Vermax was much larger when in close proximity than he was flying overhead. “He is wonderful Jace. Though it is best if I keep my distance. He might not like me.”   Jacaerys laughed amber-brown eyes sparkling with mirth. “Might not like you?” He mused knowing that such a thought was outlandish. If he liked you then Vermax most certainly would. A dragon could always pick apart friend from foe and you were as far from an enemy as one could be.   “Yes what — Jacaerys that is a perfectly reasonable thing to say” You countered flustered by Jace’s reaction to your skepticism. His smile was cheery and heartfelt as he stared at you and then offered his hand. “I do not think that this is a good idea.” A soft utterance emerged from under your breath.  “Trust me.” His tone softened exponentially shifting from playful to gentle reassuring. You hesitated before taking a hold of his hand and Jacaerys nearly brushed his thumb across your knuckles out of sheer instinct. Whatever thoughts he had he pushed them to the far recesses of his mind.   You trusted Jacaerys more than most prompting you to nod as he ushered you closer to Vermax. His grasp was tender as to not frighten you which only made your heart flutter with affection. The dragon bristled and made a series of noises some more serpentine than others.  Vermax lowered his head pushing closer towards his rider as the dragon bowed to Jacaerys. You were close enough to feel the waves of heat wafting from his breath close enough to outstretch your arm and feel his scales beneath your palm.   The scent of brimstone and dragonscale lingered upon Vermax like a crackling fire and smoke. You watched with bated breath as Jace’s palm moved to Vermax’s snout digits tracing along the olive-hued scales and down toward his jaw. “Sagon iēdrosa” Jace murmured stepping closer to his dragon. “Sȳz.”  High Valyrian was an exquisite language a beautiful symphony from an ancient era. Jacaerys had become proficient in such a tongue and the way he spoke it had you mesmerized. With a gentle smile he still held your hand gesturing toward Vermax.  “What are you saying to him?” You inquired losing some of your fear. It gradually waned the closer Jacaerys had inched you toward the dragon who showed no ill will towards you at all. Instead Vermax’s burnished hues glimmered with intrigue — you were a familiar scent emblazoned upon Jace but not a familiar face.  “I told him to be still for you” Jacaerys replied fingers flexing around your own as he carefully guided you toward Vermax’s neck where the scales began to flare and thicken. Olive turned to emerald in some places verdant shades clashing together. “Place your hand here.”  Your breath hitched within your throat as Jace became in close proximity to you closer than he’d been before. His grasp was a tender one placing your palm atop the dragon’s throat. Warmth crept along the length of your spine filling your belly with an eruption of butterflies.   You made the mistake of glancing at Jacaerys for the briefest moment able to spot the rosy flush of color within his visage and the gleam within his stare. As soon as you’d made contact he happened to glance away making a soft noise as it stirred within his throat.  Vermax chortled the dragon’s attention fixated upon you as you brushed your fingers across his scales. Jace had dropped your hand realizing the sliver of space between you both as he stepped aside content to observe you with his dragon.   It was your enchanting laughter that lifted his spirits the gentle way in which you stroked across Vermax’s neck and shoulder. “He is beautiful” You hummed countenance bright with a joyous radiance as you looked at Jacaerys once more. The gap between you had grown much to your dismay. “How do you say that in High Valyrian?”   Jace hesitated lips parting just slightly. His heart nearly skipped a beat when you smiled at him expectant and awaiting his answer. He became so easily distracted in your presence and it was somewhat vexing to behold. “Gevie” He replied briefly clearing his throat. “Gevie means beautiful in High Valyrian.”  With a soft hum you looked to Vermax your grin toothy and amused. “Gevie Vermax.” You spoke clearly but the dragon did not seem to understand what you said — it wasn’t a command. Instead he let out a series of reptilian noises nostrils flaring with snort almost like that of a horse.   Vermax’s lack of reaction made you frown but Jacaerys appeared amused by it at least. “Gevie isn’t a command” He mused head canting to one side. “Your High Valyrian needs improvement.” His tone was jocular teasing — it made your heart stir within your chest.  “Fortunately I have the perfect teacher standing before me.” You countered with a giggle noticing the way in which a shade of pink settled into his features. Jacaerys was beautiful and handsome but his flustered behavior only made him more perfect to you.   The dragon shook its head seeking the embrace of his rider before he began to take flight. A massive gust of wind from the flap of his wings nearly knocked you down causing you to crouch and grip the stone of the ramparts.  Jacaerys smiled watching as Vermax ascended taking to the skies above Dragonstone once more. You watched with a semblance of awe slowly rising to your feet as the dragon became a mere specter amidst the cloudless sky. He did not stray too far circling around with the likes of Moondancer and Syrax.  “Someday I will take you flying with me” Jace suggested nose wrinkling slightly at your bewildered expression. “I would keep you safe.” He reassured you before words could emerge from your mouth his chuckle amicable as he led you back toward the gates of Dragonstone.  “I trust you but flying?” To see the world from such great heights sounded wonderful but you feared the fall — and you feared the unknown of it all even more. “That might take more convincing than this did.” You mused walking alongside him as the gates became closer.   A huff escaped him hand dropping from the pommel of his shortsword to his side a symbol of letting his guard down. A comfortable silence settled between the both of you occasionally accompanied by a brief bout of laughter or tender smiles.   As the gates loomed over the both of you Jacaerys hesitated deliberating on what to say next. There were so many things he wanted to say to you — where did he begin? The nerves of first affection grabbed hold of him but he remained resistant wanting nothing more than to tell you how much you meant to him.  “Perhaps an exchange is in-order” Jacaerys began shifting his weight from one foot to the next. “You come flying with me and I will teach you High Valyrian.” He mused smothering his grin at your expression. You were clearly wary and unimpressed.  “Danger for something that I could learn in the comfort of a book? I think not your Grace.” With a grin of your own Jace happened to snicker his visage invoking an unspoken challenge albeit playful. “If I am ever feeling bold and spontaneous I will inform you as soon as possible.”  Jacaerys hummed head ducking for just a moment before he met your gaze again doting and overflowing with a subtle warmth. “Thank you for this” He began tone heartfelt and genuine. “I would not know what to do if it weren’t for your company and comfort. I’ve found it difficult to remain jovial as of late but it’s rather effortless in your presence.”  His genial compliments made your stomach turn with excitement and you could soar away. Jacaerys would be an excellent ruler should he take the Iron Throne — such grace compassion and gallantry were true hallmarks of what would make a good King. You felt the familiar smitten flush dance along your skin.   “Of course Jace — you never have to ask for it” Your fingers twisted into the silk of your gown an outlet for your growing nerves. “You’ve no idea how much your company means to me. We will get through this together that much I know.” With a brief nod you felt his stare grow in intensity.  Before he could bear his heart to you on a whim the gates opened revealing several Targaryen bannermen and Kingsguard. It was sudden and somewhat jarring placing the two of you back within reality — in a realm on the brink of war.   “I should return to your mother I fear I’ve neglected my duties enough today” You murmured offering Jace a kindly smile before dropping to curtsy. He seemed starstruck as if caught within the depths of his own thoughts. “Good afternoon your Grace.”  Formalities reappeared again much to his disdain. He loved it when you called him Jace or Jacaerys or your Grace whenever you teased him. To hear it used in the context of nobility made him feel distant but he understood. You possessed a strong sense of propriety.   “My Lady.” Jace replied watching as you took your leave to rejoin the other handmaidens and guardsmen. Jacaerys cursed himself for not making the most of the moment but he knew that he could make his own opportunity forge it if it never came about.  He intended to do just that.  𝐃𝐑𝐀𝐆𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐓𝐎𝐍𝐄 𝐀𝐓 𝐃𝐔𝐒𝐊 𝐖𝐀𝐒 𝐄𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐋 with braziers dancing across the obsidian interior. Stars sparkled above a clear night sky dragons dancing above. It was almost like something from a fairytale or a painting mesmerizing to behold as you gazed up at the scaling ceiling of your bedchambers.  Your quarters were small and homely befitting of your status as lady-in-waiting. Rhaenyra had ensured that your lodgings and that of your father were enough — more than suitable really. The feathered mattress you slept upon was made for royalty you thought.  The constant flicker of candlelight provided a source of warmth as you rolled over within your bed blankets hauled up beneath your chin. It was too early to fall asleep too late to do anything of substance.   A knock at your door gave you pause brows furrowing together as you retrieved your robe lacing it around the sheer gossamer of your nightgown. Bare feet traveled across the cold stone until you reached the metal hoop slotted atop mahogany.   With a pull you opened the door surprised to find Jacaerys who had abandoned his traditional Targaryen regalia hands occupied with a stack of various tomes and scrolls. His mop of dark curls framed his face and even he seemed just as bewildered as you were.  “Jacaerys” His nightly visits were rather uncommon — in fact this was only the second time he’d come the first following Lucerys’s passing. You swallowed the growing lump within your throat stepping aside to allow him inside of your chambers. “Is everything alright?”   Jace placed the stack of books atop the table that sat amongst small lounge chairs ensuring to clear his throat before he spoke. “Of course” He replied gesturing toward your newfound reading material. “I’ve brought you scripts to learn High Valyrian.”   You blinked touched by such a thoughtful gesture. You smoothed your palms across your robe stepping forward to inspect the books many of which appeared ancient and weathered. “You didn’t have to” You replied head canting to one side. “Many of these seem important. Are you sure that no one will miss these?”  A brief chuckle escaped him before he shook his head. “The Maesters might but they’ve read them a hundred times over I’m certain of it. You will find more use.” He replied retreating toward the threshold of your chambers. Jacaerys wanted to keep his visit brief — visiting a young woman’s quarters in the dead of night was not exactly an intelligent move.   “You’re leaving so soon?” Your inquiry held a twinge of disappointment hoping that he would stay and converse with you at the very least. “Jacaerys I assure you that no one will admonish you if you stay for a few minutes longer.” The softness of your voice enticed him and he very nearly confessed then and there.  The weight of growing sentiments felt as if they would swallow him whole if he did not speak them into fruition. With the threat of a looming war and the potential for oblivion Jacaerys was unsure of what gave him pause. The fear of rejection perhaps? That wasn’t it.   It took a moment for you to adjust and when you did you noted his own attire — a billowy tunic and dark trousers that happened to make him appear softer in the candlelight. The sharp black and crimson of his house’s colors made him intimidating and poised but no longer.  You saw Jacaerys himself doe-eyed and magnificent.  “I fear what will happen if I stay” Jacaerys confessed squaring himself with the door. If he continued to linger in your chambers without restraint or without additional eyes he knew what would happen — he did not want to sully your honor. “I won’t.”   “Jacaerys” You whispered brows furrowing together to form a look of confusion and startlement. Out of concern you stepped closer abandoning the scripts of High Valyrian now scattered across your table. “What’s wrong? I don’t understand.”   The inner war he waged within seemed to reflect upon his countenance as Jacaerys exhaled — it was laced with stress a heaviness that you struggled to understand. He seemed flustered not wanting to meet your amiable gaze. “It is best if I leave it alone.” He replied taking a hold of your hands. “I would not tarnish your honor.”   That is what he meant.  Something boiled over inside of you the butterflies and blossoming affection turning into a tidal wave that threatened to swallow you whole. As Jace held your hands he seemed desperate to convey such a message — whatever he wanted he could not have.   A brief exhale escaped you before you steeled yourself thumbs brushing across his knuckles over the veins of his hands. “You wouldn’t tarnish it” You whispered stomach churning with molten heat. “I know that you wouldn’t Jace. I trust you the most.”   Jacaerys felt the stirring within his chest the first inkling of arousal settling into his very bones. It was somewhat foreign — a new feeling but exciting and exhilarating. “I would never hurt you” He insisted and you believed him wholeheartedly. “What I feel for you I do not wish to feel this way with anyone else.”  If you could’ve collapsed then and there you would’ve — you thought it would happen with the way your knees rattled together beneath your nightgown. The beating of your heart accelerated into a violent crescendo and then you felt the rush — the love you had for him desire admiration neediness.  A tenuous silence drifted between you both the tension thick enough to be sliced with a blade. Jacaerys had inched closer without thinking able to peer down into your eyes swirling with affection and bewilderment. “If I told you I felt the same?” Your voice barely rose above a whisper.   Deliberately Jacaerys released one of your hands allowing his palm to fully envelop your face the pad of his thumb caressing your cheekbone. “I would never difile your virtue or take it for granted. You must tell me if this is something you want.” He insisted jaw tightening as he anxiously awaited your answer.   You knew that he wouldn’t — Jacaerys Velaryon was the most honorable man you knew one that would never lay a finger upon you unless you consented. You couldn’t imagine a return to friendship if you happened to reject him — you didn’t want to reject him either.   “I do” A shudder ran down your spine bringing a wave of thrill and anticipation with it. “I want this — and I want you Jacaerys if you’ll have me.” Part of you became nervous knowing that you had never bedded a man before but you pushed the thought aside.  “A hundred times over.” Jace uttered dipping down to press his lips against yours. The kiss was incredibly sweet and delicate something brief to test the waters as the two of you began to explore uncharted territory. Your hands reached for his chest flat atop his sternum.   Allowing the kiss to linger you tilted your head just slightly enough to permit a sensual progression. He kissed you so sweetly treated you as if you were precious something to be worshiped. When he inevitably pulled away you felt a twinge of nervousness.   “I’ve never done anything like this before” Your confession was a strenuous one and you hoped that he wouldn’t be disappointed by your lack of experience. Most men already had a plethora by the time betrothals and first love emerged. “Is that alright?”  “Of course” Jacaerys reassured you with a gentle squeeze brows furrowing together with insistence. He hesitated somewhat sheepish to admit the very same but he knew you wouldn’t admonish him for it. “I haven’t either if that’s alright.” He mused the corner of his mouth twitching into a smile.  A sweet bout of laughter escaped you before you nodded several times over unable to keep from withholding your happiness. “I suppose that this will be quite the learning experience.” You felt his thumb stroke along your jaw his lips molding themselves to yours in another kiss.  Passion and tension began to mount a continuous climb of affection prepared to turn into something fiery. Jacaerys worried that he would disappoint you or perhaps feel clumsy and awkward but those were mere insecurities — he knew that you wouldn’t hold it against him.   One of his hands dropped finding the pliant curve of your hip as he sank his digits into you able to haul you closer until there was no space left between the two of you. Kissing felt effortless with Jace despite your inexperience — he was gentle and deliberate ensuring that he took his time with you above all else.  Your fingers wandered from his chest to his broad shoulders finding the curls of hair at the nape of his neck. Jacaerys exhaled a shiver rolling down his spine as you began to gently tug at his tresses. He canted his head slightly enough to deepen the kiss and hold you close.   It was Jace who slowly broke the kiss but just enough to speak warm breath fanning across your face. “May I take you to bed?” He murmured tracing across the silky plane of your jaw. His excitement began to grow heart hammering within his chest.  In such close quarters to one another you noticed the faint dusting of freckles along the bridge of his nose spreading just underneath his eyes. You pressed a kiss against the corner of his mouth. “You may.” Eagerness replaced any nervousness you were experiencing then and there.  Jacaerys found your hand twining his digits with your own as the two of you inched toward your bed. It was plush lined with furs and enough blankets to warm the Seven Kingdoms. He stood at the precipice of a cliff preparing to dive headfirst — and it felt incredible.  He watched with bated breath rapturous and enamored as your digits settled along the many ties of your outer robes. You began the sluggish process of untethering each one until the garment loosened enough for you to shrug it aside and drape it over the chest at the foot of your bed.   Even with the veil of sheer silky fabric Jacaerys quietly admired your physique shapely and beautiful in every way imaginable. “You are perfect” Jace uttered hands coming to settle around your hips searching for any sign of hesitation on your end. “Beautiful.” He exhaled feeling you coax him in for another kiss.  Through the slip of silk and gossamer Jacaerys deftly felt his way along your body taking his time savoring you. Every curve and dip every little detail he committed to memory lost within a sea of you. Your kiss became passionate and he was more than happy to reciprocate the intensity burning between you both.  Jace felt your fingers tease the hem of his tunic enough to elicit a subtle gasp from him. The sensation of your flesh against his caused goosebumps to spread from where your digits brushed against his waist. He released you for a moment long enough for him to assist you in removing his nightshirt.  A pang of admiration struck at your stomach breath hitching within your throat. He was pretty — well-muscled for a young man with sunkissed skin smatterings of freckles along his shoulders. Jacaerys felt your lips press against the hollow of his throat warmth fanning out from the simple contact.  “I want to take care of you if you’ll let me.” Jace murmured insistent on pleasuring you above all else. He knew very little of what ensued between a woman and a man within the confines of their bedchambers outside of the simple act itself but it was easy to imagine.   Your lips parted heat sinking into your bones as you reached for his curled tresses digits slipping through his soft dark locks. “Yes” Your voice was barely above a whisper as you coaxed him in for another kiss one charged with arousal and desire. “I want you Jace.”  The heady wanton way in which you spoke his name caused him to shiver bare chest pressed snugly against your own. Even the veil of silken fabric could not hide your supple frame from him the peaks of your breasts soft and pliant.   His kiss was so gentle — it was charged with lust despite its tame nature not that you minded. You felt his hands fall to your hips melding into your curves before he began to gather the fabric within his hands. Jacaerys looked to you before continuing and you gave him a nod to signal your approval.  Silky gossamer slowly crawled up the length of your legs as Jace gathered your gown sliding it upward. You couldn’t fight against the onslaught of molten heat that churned violently within your stomach shamelessly pooling between your legs.   Jacaerys hesitated likely thinking of what to do next. He had been educated on what consummation was the act of making an heir — but there was more to it more of you to explore. Curiosity consumed him as he placed his palm atop the bare skin of your thigh using the other to ease you down onto your bed.   He sat beside you leg to leg as he continued to push your nightgown up toward your hips skirts gathering around the middle of your thighs. “May I?” Jace’s voice seemed to grow husky with arousal desire burning its way through his veins.   Instead you gingerly took a hold of his hand guiding it underneath your gown as you parted your legs enough to allow him unhindered access. He caressed you wherever he could shuddering when you held the trail of your nightgown in one hand to push it up around your hips.   You nearly squeaked when his palm brushed along your inner thigh lips parting with a sharp exhale. Jace moved closer as close as he could as his mouth graced your neck digits inching toward the slick heat between your legs. When he found it you let out a simpering whine reaching for his forearm.  A hushed moan escaped you as two digits trailed across your cunt exploratory and feather-light. Your hips canted forward into the sensation desiring more — and Jace obliged pushing both fingers inward until they slipped past your folds.   “Jace” You whispered eyes fluttering shut as he continued to pepper strings of sweet kisses along your neck gown sagging enough to let him kiss your shoulder. “Do not stop please.” That breathy plea exuded some power over him and he was enthralled prepared to do whatever you asked of him.  “Is that alright?” Jacaerys asked digits becoming a touch more vigorous as he stroked at your slit surprised at how wet you were. If it were a common thing he would know what to expect in the future. His thumb grazed your clit and you gasped.   With a soft hum of approval you nodded shifting your legs apart just a little more. “Y—Yes” Absentmindedly your fingers slipped from the taut muscle of his forearm to his hand the one wedged underneath your gown. “I — Like this.” You instructed him to touch you how you had touched yourself.   Jacaerys watched through a half-lidded stare beyond entranced with you. You were beautiful — so painfully ethereal that it made him want to kneel before you a goddess made to be worshiped. You adjusted his fingers ensuring that his thumb pressed against your clit with continuous pressure.  Despite his nonexistent experience he was doing wonders for you — he was attentive and willing to learn your body as you saw fit. He was so handsome lips curling into an affectionate smile before he kissed your jaw digits continuing from where they’d left off.   Your palm fell across his thigh nails beginning to dig themselves into the muscle there as he touched your clit digits tracing around the rest of your cunt. The candlelight highlighted his features in such perfect detail the illumination slight.   Reverence seeped into each action every stroke of his fingers evoking a string of whimpers from you. He was passionate and careful willing to learn your body better than you. He continued to caress your clit the sensation sending jolts of electricity throughout your body.   His name became your prayer devolving into desperate moans and whispered pleas as you rocked your hips into the sensation of his hand. “Jacaerys” You sighed with passion feeling the stirring within your stomach. Arousal consumed every part of you just as it did him. “Jace.”  The dark-haired Prince let out a soft groan into the hollow of your throat wanting you more than anything and the hand you had perched atop his thigh did little to ease the fever. He kissed your neck again scarlet-faced and beyond eager whispering sweet nothings in High Valyrian against your skin.  Excitement and the heat of the moment seemed to get to you as you used one hand to sloppily unlace the leather ties of his trousers. You wanted to touch him too let him feel exactly how you felt — how he made you feel.   Jace shivered not objecting but he wanted to focus on you above all else. “What about you?” He asked feeling his cock twitch with want. The ache he had for you was almost painful threatening to tear him apart if he couldn’t find relief.   “Together” You suggested turning enough to crawl into his lap much to his delight. Jacaerys held you steady lips clamoring together in a messy flurry of tongue and adoration. It was the anticipation of youth — the desire and sentiments overrode everything else made duty disappear. “You are perfect.”  His brief smile made all of your worry dissipate fading into mere background noise. Your hands returned to the leather ties of his breeches once more sluggishly loosening them. Jace steeled himself a fire burning within his belly as you reached down.  A low satisfied groan tore past his lips when your hand gently wrapped around his cock searching his visage for any sign of discomfort. There was none — only desire lust festering within his gaze. He resumed touching you digits circling your clit once more.  Within your delicate grasp his length hardened your palm finding a careful rhythm. Your hips twitched rolling into the sensation of his hand. It was heavenly — the way in which he handled you was gallant and gentle. Arousal continued to gather between your thighs a new and sticky feeling.  Intermingled gasps and groans filled the air the both of you clinging to one another. Jacaerys leaned forward mouth seeking yours the kiss hot and gentle. Between your careful uncertain strokes along his length and his digits teasing your cunt the both of you were lost within the throes of passion.  He slipped his other hand underneath your nightgown with enough leverage to remove it if he so desired. Jacaerys broke the kiss long enough to ask chest heaving with heavier breaths. “May I?” He whispered voice husky and hoarse with lust.   You nodded maneuvering your arms over your head as your nightgown slipped to the floor leaving you bare before Jacaerys. The saltwater breeze which fluttered through your quarters left you shivering both from the brief chill and anticipation.   The awestruck way in which he stared at you left you hot body feverish beneath his tempered gaze. He kissed your collarbone eyes warm and affectionate. “You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.” He stated nearly breathless. His heart was yours — every fiber of his being devoted itself to you.   Smitten beneath his sweetly-spoken compliments you trailed your fingers throughout his soft curls. The other slyly descended to reach for his cock again but Jacaerys seemed to place your hand aside. You seemed confused head canting to one side. “Do you not like it?”  His bemused chuckle filled your chambers amiable and as warm as a cozy hearth. “Of course I like it” Jacaerys murmured kissing along your jaw and neck holding you as close as he could. “I’d like to focus on you. There’s something that I wanted to try if you’ll allow it.”   Surprised you seemed open to whatever he wanted to try. “Anything you want you will have. It’s yours.” You expected him to put you on your knees or turn you on your stomach. Instead he coaxed you down onto your back getting you to lay down as he crawled between your parted legs.   His mouth pressed a string of affectionate kisses along your shoulder and collarbone beginning to dip lower toward the perky swell of your breasts. You squirmed slightly uncertain of where this would lead to. You trusted Jace to follow his own instinct.  Your back arched when his mouth graced your breast pressing kisses all around the pliant flesh. A moan escaped you signaling your pleasure as he wrapped his lips around one of your nipples gingerly suckling on the pebbled bud.   “Jace” You squeaked one hand flying to his mountain of dark curls pushing your fingers through. He touched you in a way that evoked a sense of yearning as if you were the only woman in the realm. His hand kneaded into your chest a shiver coursing through him whenever you moaned his name. “Please.”  Heat simmered through him a wave of desire that only seemed to grow in intensity demanding to be extinguished. Your flesh tasted saccharine upon his tongue but there was something else he wanted to taste. As he kissed your chest he released his lips from your breast continuing his descent.  He kissed you everywhere reverence seeping into each brush of his mouth as he traversed your body. Jacaerys pressed his lips against your stomach and then to your hips palms sliding against your thighs.   A sharp exhale escaped you as he peppered a string of kisses along the inside of your thigh showering you in little pecks of affection before he flattened himself entirely. You swallowed the lump within your throat; the sight of Jace’s face wedged in between your legs made you shiver arousal following suit.  Everything was gentle even the way in which his veined hands gripped the pliant flesh of your thighs to let them rest against his shoulders. He hesitated allowing you a moment to adjust and steel yourself before he dipped forward tongue raking hot embers across your cunt.  The singular experimental stroke of his tongue caused you to shiver hands curling into fists. If you could melt away into your furs you would’ve feeling his mouth press kisses against your core. “Jace” You whined attempting to hold still and cease your squirming. “Don’t stop.”  It was all the encouragement he truly needed digits soothingly caressing along your thighs as he began to lap at your cunt adopting a pace that was a little less sluggish. He nearly groaned when he felt your hand grasp at his curled tresses sinking in toward the base of his skull.  In the nighttime gloom of Dragonstone you found warmth and comfort in one another — affections intensified and whatever bond you had before was now redefined entirely. Jacaerys loved you he had never been more sure of himself until now dutifully bringing about your pleasure.  A myriad of soft whimpers and whines escaped you hand gingerly tugging on Jace’s hair as he buried his mouth in the apex of your thighs. His tongue vigorously lapped and traced over your core savoring your taste committing it to memory. Bathed in moonlight Jace appeared more ethereal than ever the muscles flexing within his back.  With slow eager laps of his tongue Jacaerys made sure to savor you letting it flick across your clit. The short dizzying gasp that tore past your mouth spurred him on as he pressed another string of kisses against your slit. The continued sensation of your digits carding through his curls made him sigh with elation.  He brought you closer heart leaping into his throat when you began to writhe beneath him hips tilting forward into each stroke of his mouth. “You’re perfect” Jacaerys whispered ensuring that you could hear it. Soft utterances of High Valyrian were etched into the flesh of your thigh. “Perfect.”  Blossoming beneath his sweet compliments your fingers curled against his scalp unable to lay still as Jace resumed his previous ministrations. The warmth of his tongue left you with a blistering want stomach churning with a wave of arousal.   As he lapped at your clit again you whimpered moaning his name as if to keep his attention there. Jacaerys’s tender expression also bore a great deal of concentration dark eyes flickering toward you. “There?” He uttered hoping that you would guide him to where he needed to be.   Your head bobbed up and down against the furs flesh beginning to glisten with the first inklings of perspiration. Everything felt feverishly hot as if you would be turned to ash where you sat. Jacaerys was attentive and loving following your breathy plea as he pursed his lips around the pearl of your cunt.   Jace shivered at the sounds you made enticed by each whimper and moan every twitch of your body. He suckled on the sensitive bundle of nerves alternating between that and greedy vigorous laps of his tongue. He let himself be lost within bliss arousal mounting from pleasuring you.  You reached for his hand fingers interlocking atop the swell of your hip as he continued to lap at your aching core. He squeezed your hand as a sign of reassurance buried deep within your sweet cunt something that he wanted to have again and again.  He was at your mercy the heir to the Iron Throne the Prince of Dragonstone — and you hadn’t the slightest clue. Jace’s brow creased in concentration as he focused on what spots made you squirm the most continuing to dutifully lap at your clit until your knees trembled.  “Jace” A needy moan left you reverberating within the obsidian confines of your chambers. Arousal rushed through you molten heat oozing from between your thighs a nectar as sweet as honey. “I—I think I’m close.” You groaned unsure if it was just the throes of ecstasy or reality.   Nevertheless you were on the verge of reaching your peak and you didn’t want him to stop. Instead you urged his head forward fingers laced within his dark curls right at the nape of his neck. Jacaerys groaned in delight thoroughly enjoying the way you continued to coax him inward — he happily devoured every drop.  With another barrage of his tongue assaulting your cunt you whimpered turning malleable within Jace’s hands. He knew that you were on the verge and so he pursed his lips around your clit once more and that was more than enough.  His name emerged from your lips like a reverent prayer the only name that you knew in that moment. Your release was hot like a rush of fire that didn’t simmer immediately. The residual sensation lingered and Jace helped you through it.  Your thighs twitched absentmindedly attempting to clench together but Jace held you apart soothing you with kisses along your thighs. The blissful contented expression that soon followed was a beautiful one — Jace was shocked to know that he could do that to you bring you to ruin.  His gallant smile gave you pause as you studied the rosy flush within his features the glistening sheen of your arousal upon his lips. Jacaerys seemed entirely unphased basking in your aftermath all the same his curls tousled and disheveled.   “I didn’t hurt you did I?” Your tone was sheepish realizing how much you’d tugged at his hair. If it were you a tender-headed maiden you would’ve been batting his hand away. Jace’s bemused chuckle caused you to duck your head.  Jace disarmed you with a charming doting smile and a simple look of those earthen-brown eyes of his and shook his head. “You could never hurt me” He replied his attempt at gentle flirtation. “I worry more for you.” His confession was soft-spoken.  The act of consummation was not intended to be a comfortable one — for a woman at least. Jacaerys knew to broach this with care to make sure that you were well enough before all else. He inched forward from between your thighs resting his head atop your stomach.  He allowed you a moment of composure feeling your digits trace the lines of his countenance stroke at his tresses. Jace pressed a string of kisses all around your body wherever his lips could reach. The moment was incredibly tender lingering with the tension of a blossoming ardor.  Through the comfortable haze of silence you cleared your throat staring down at Jacaerys with what only could be described at a look of complete and utter adoration. He was so kind so noble and gentle yet with the fervor of the dragon’s blood a desire to do good. You felt so fortunate even moreso when he smiled at you pressing a kiss to your hip.  “I want you Jacaerys” You whispered watching as Jace began to sit up letting your legs trap him on either side. “More than I’ve ever wanted anyone else.” It was the hitch within his throat that made you shiver heart hammering beneath your breast as you began to confess your feelings — it was inevitable.   Jace reveled at the sight of you naked and glimmering within the moonlit dusk candlelight bathing your physique in shades of flickering orange. His descent was slow as he covered you with his body lips parting to allow a shaky exhale before he kissed your brow. “You have my heart” He uttered forehead resting against yours. “Everything I am is yours.”   Your palms moved to cup either side of his face thumbs caressing along his cheekbones before you smiled kissing the corner of his mouth. “I am yours.” You assured your commitment resolute before the Gods — before Jacaerys Velaryon.   It was a poignant moment one that seemed intermingled with the seriousness of your words yet still tinged with the youthful excitement of a first love. He kissed you slow and amorous full of an unrestrained affection that no longer seemed weighed-down by unspoken sentiments.   “Are you certain that this is what you want?” Jace asked his voice a soft caress through your haze of kisses. He would not fault you if you wanted to stop now — and he would if you wished it of him. As much as he desired you he valued your virtue above his own.   “Yes” You replied your palms gliding from his soft visage to the taut muscle of his shoulders lacing your fingers around the back of his neck. “Are you certain too? I worry that you might regret lying with me.”   Jacaerys shook his head brows furrowing together to reflect a semblance of disbelief. He reached down to caress your cheek making sure that you understood every word. “Nothing in the world would ever make me regret this” He murmured. “I’ve never been more certain about anything before.”   A brief stirring of adoration fluttered within your chest and you knew that you wanted no one else ever again. You pulled yourself off of the mattress enough to kiss him sinking into the sweet bliss of the moment as he reciprocated. His mouth moved in-tandem with yours eyes beginning to flutter shut.  His hands planted themselves into the feathered pillow on either side of your head but it didn’t last long. Jacaerys leaned back maneuvering out of the leather of his trousers flush against you once they were removed. You were so soft like an ocean of silk beneath him.  He felt one of your legs hitch around his hips bodies together beneath the furs. The chill of your chambers dissipated replaced by the warmth of your skin. You kept your hands poised against his shoulders dancing across the smattering of freckles there as you continued to kiss him as if each one would be your last.  The hardened swell of his cock pressed against your lower stomach and you could feel his breath grow heavier between kisses. He was perfect — flawless so handsome that it made you ache with want.   Jace kissed you again and again feeling the soft peaks of your breasts brush against his chest. He adjusted his weight shifted his hips as he pressed the head of his length against your slick cunt. He was somewhat nervous — perhaps not as much as you but anxious enough. He made sure to be careful feeling your legs nudge themselves apart.  A look of mutual preparedness passed between you both between your doe-eyed gaze of anticipation and Jace’s mounting look of want there was little room left for uncertainty. He sat up enough to position himself against your aching core his cock splitting past your folds before it prodded at your entrance.  You steeled yourself and Jace made sure to be slow afraid of hurting you enough to cause true discomfort. As he tilted forward his length filled you sheathing himself inside of you inch by inch. Admittedly it wasn’t a good feeling — not initially anyway.   A sharp exhale escaped you as he bottomed out staying still atop you as he allowed you time to grow accustomed to him. Waves of complete and utter bliss rolled through him his own pleasure nearly overwhelming. You were tight maidenhead intact for the next few moments until he began to move.  “Are you alright?” Jace whispered around the shell of your ear pressing against you once more as he reassuringly kissed along the side of your face. He felt despicable for causing you any amount of pain but you seemed to dismiss his concern.  “I am” You placated him with a smile coaxing him in for a kiss. It was best if you didn’t think about it — and with time it would feel better. Everything was awkward and clumsy the follies of youth but as Jace began to move a fire began to burn within your belly. “Jace.” You sighed keeping your leg around his hips.  A soft groan resonated beside your ear as Jace adopted a sluggish rhythm not wanting to intensify things so quickly. Your eyes fluttered shut body content to bend to his thrusts grow accustomed to the act itself. He reciprocated your kiss black curls falling in front of his temples.   Bliss soon replaced discomfort the more you allowed yourself to adjust. You shifted your legs further apart one hand falling toward his bicep the other remaining tangled at the nape of his neck. The sounds of your lovemaking soon filled your chambers with your foreheads pressed together.  Your name fell from his tongue in a needy groan and it made you shiver body reacting with a barrage of gooseflesh along your spine. Perspiration grew upon his brow as he maintained his pace digits curling into the furs on either side of you.   The sound of your pleasured moans made him feel better a sign that you were no longer riddled with soreness and irritation. Jace pressed a trail of hot messy kisses along your face reaching to the sweet spot beneath your jaw. He kept himself anchored there feeling your hand squeeze at his bicep.  “Jace!” You squeaked flushed at the growing lewdness of the noises — the squelching the passionate groans and heavy breathing. He was perfect cock filling you in a way that left you completely satisfied. Jace felt your hand fall away from his bicep reaching for his own interlocked hands falling back against the cushions.  He shuddered reveling in the way your cunt tightened around him the sensation of your hand within his hair hands joined at your side. Jace’s pace began to quicken but only somewhat enough to really feel the myriad of pleasure take hold.   You yearned for him in every way imaginable; your body ached with each movement every thrust as he leisurely moved in and out of you. His cock pulsated with a dull throbbing enough to fill his belly with a raging fire. He kissed you again lips traversing wherever they saw fit peppering every inch of your sweet skin.  Time seemed to move agonizingly slow in your presence — Jacaerys wouldn’t want it any other way. If he could capture this moment he would’ve. Every moment was graced by a warm intimacy that sank into his very bones his adoration for you furthered with each roll of his hips sheathing himself inside of you.   His soft lips graced your collarbone continuing to make love to you in the only way he knew how. It was passionate and gentle in a way reserved for the deepest of lovers. Jace grunted when your hips involuntarily rolled upward to grind against him lips parting as he squeezed your hand.  At last he lifted his head your eyes locking together. Your countenance was exceptionally beautiful especially when painted with the shade of desire and it had him aching with want. His jaw tensed when you brushed dark curls away from his eyes palm lingering long enough to pull him down for a kiss.  His cock continued to hit your cunt with a tame fervor filling you completely testing your limits as he neared his peak. Jacaerys knew that there would be more moments like these in the future — his energy was waning and perhaps the unfamiliarity of it all contributed to this.  Your name spilled from his tongue throat echoing with a soft groan as his pace became slightly erratic. It was difficult to control himself amidst chasing after his release but he maintained what little composure he had gritting his teeth together as he thrust into you again.  Pleasure contorted into ecstasy becoming an unstoppable wave that was quick to take hold of him. Concentration intermingled with bliss were etched into his features face pressing against yours nearly breathless as you kissed him again.  With a groan Jacaerys rocked forward again spilling himself inside of you. In hindsight it was both brazen and feckless done in the heat of the moment but he cared little of it for the time being. His cock throbbed thrusting into you again a time or two before he stilled completely.   Heavy pants resonated between you both as you caught your breath flush against one another in the aftermath. You pressed a kiss against Jace’s cheek trailing your fingers throughout his hair. He was quick to kiss you gathering his composure before he pulled himself out of you.  A rush of sticky warmth slathered the inside of your thighs leaving behind a feeling of slight discomfort. Jace gathered a cloth for you to clean yourself with returning to lay beside you as he rucked the furs up around your bodies. The air was colder at nightfall injected with a saltwater mist.   “I apologize if I hurt you” Jacaerys uttered dark brows furrowing together as you wriggled closer resting your head atop his bare chest. Your arm draped over him allowing yourself to be close a feeling that he wanted more than anything else. “It was not my intention.” He kissed the top of your head.  “You didn’t” You replied tracing soft patterns against his skin angling your head up enough to kiss him. Jace cupped your jaw leaning in to deepen the tender entanglement lost within the bliss of your lips. “You would never hurt me.”   Jacaerys was fiercely protective over you that much was true — even from himself. He kept an arm wrapped around you cradling you at his side as he gazed into your eyes. He could see you then — his beloved wife the future Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Perhaps it was too early to tell but he knew.   As the both of you settled in together your maidenhead now lost you couldn’t help but smile. Jacaerys had made your first experience more than anyone ever could — you hoped that it would stay that way forever. “Does your offer of teaching High Valyrian still stand?” You mused.  A huff of amusement left Jacaerys as he turned his head enough to look at you a smile playing at either corner of his mouth. “I thought you wanted those dusty old books.” Admittedly his offering of those damned texts is what started this in the first place — he had to be grateful.   “I knew that you would be kind enough to bring them to me” You confessed nose wrinkling in amusement. “An excuse to see you.” The look on Jace’s face was one of theatrical shock and you erupted into a fit of laughter when he squeezed your hip.  “You might grow tired of me if I am to teach you High Valyrian.” Jacaerys mused his smile one of complete and utter warmth. Anyone would know that his love for you was obvious — there wasn’t any subtlety about it.   You shook your head comfortably sinking against him your upper body lounging atop him. “I could never grow tired of you Jacaerys Velaryon.” You exhaled exhaustion beginning to grip you. It was bound to happen eventually given the abnormally late hour.  Jace was thankful that you weren’t looking — his face was dusted with a rather obvious layer of pink and yet the feeling was beyond satisfying. The two of you allowed the silence to sink through accompanied by the sound of the encroaching tide as it broke upon the jagged rock and cliff sides surrounding Dragonstone.   “Will you stay?” You asked hoping that he would be agreeable to it. It was a risky proposition but Jace knew that he couldn’t leave you after this — he didn’t want to either. No one would come clamoring about within his chambers at first light.   “Of course” He murmured lips twitching into a sweet smile. “Though I should go at the first light of dawn.” Jace’s tone was one of clear disappointment but it was best to keep suspicions low.

Name: Anastaszia Nivalis  Age: 22 in human years.  Title: Queen of the White Walkers. Queen of the Kingdom of Always Winter. The Snow Queen.  Backstory:  White Walkers known by some as The Cold Ones or The Others are an ancient species of mythical beings who inhabit the icy tundra beyond the Wall in Westeros in a kingdom known as the Lands of Always Winter. They are ethereal creatures similar to faeries or elves (the Sidhe made of ice) who have the power to control snow and ice as well as the ability to raise the dead turning them into subservient creatures known as Wights.  Head of the White Walkers is the Night King absolute monarch of the Kingdom of Always Winter. Turned into the First White Walker by the Children of the Forest using a cursed dragon glass dagger the Night King has ruled his people for the past ten thousand years.  While the Night King has created many White Walkers of his own all of whom take up varying important roles in his kingdom he has only one true child; his only daughter the only White Walker to share his blood thus making her the heir to his throne - Crown Princess Anastaszia.  Anastaszia Nivalis is the only trueborn child of the Night King. The word ‘trueborn’ takes on a different meaning in White Walker culture than it does in Westeros. While their ‘trueborn’ means legitimate - born to two married parents - in the Lands of Always Winter it has a much more literal meaning. For you see rather than having been created through magic as her ‘brothers’ were Anastaszia was born in the same way that a human would be.  Because of this she was granted the same powers as her father - and also has his royal blood running through her veins. This by the laws of their kingdom makes her the second true White Walker and also makes her the only one fit to be heir to the Ice Throne.  She has naturally lived a very privileged upbringing because of this. From birth she has been lauded as special her life’s purpose being to one day take the throne and become a great leader as her father is.  Anastaszia grew up within the Ice Palace receiving a formal education meant to prepare her for leadership. She was taught arithmetic languages social etiquette diplomacy and various other lessons that would be expected of a future Queen Regnant to know. As she grew older the princess would also sit in on royal council meetings held by her father and his advisors giving her the opportunity to voice her own opinions on matters of state.  She also spent many hours hunting horseback riding and being trained how to use her mythical abilities - and while she has mastered these to a great extent there are some that she still can struggle with from time to time something which is often a cause of great embarrassment to her.  The Crown Princess is doted upon by her father who adores his only child to the point of almost spoiling her. She has a positive relationship with her family and has always been encouraged to be the best version of herself that she can.  From early childhood Anastaszia has been fascinated by the culture of the creatures who exist beyond her kingdom - Warm-Bloods. Warm-Bloods (the name by which White Walkers refer to humans have been a source of contention within the Lands of Always Winter for some time. When the Night King and his people turned on the Children of the Forest - seeking their own independence from the Children of the Forest and to no longer be used as weapons.  This lead to what is historically known as the Long Night - which culminated in the Battle for the Dawn which is what lead to the creation of the Wall and the establishment of the Night’s Watch. Anastaszia was an infant during the Long Night and has no memory of it though in the subsequent years that followed she of course was educated on what happened and the significance this had on her people.  There have been tensions between Warm-Bloods and White Walkers since further back than Anastaszia can remember. With the passage of time White Walkers faded into obscurity becoming something of a myth - an old wives’ tale to scare children with. Meanwhile Anastaszia received a basic education - as much as could be provided - about Warm-Blood culture. The more she learned about it the more fascinated she became.  During the hours that she and her ice-horses would ride further into the Southern hemisphere Anastaszia began to collect several little trinkets belonging to the Warm-Blood realm. She keeps these collections on a shelf in her royal bedchambers and likes to add more and more to it as often as she can.  It was always a dream of Anastaszia’s to travel South one day to go beyond the Wall and visit the species that she has dedicated so much of her life to learning about. A dream that she often spoke to her father about. And while the Night King deep down also hopes that peace may be possible between the two realms he has become rather cynical towards Warm-Bloods having fought against them before. But when his beloved young daughter began speaking so warmly about them and their cultures the Night King came to hope that the Princess might be the one to broker peace between the species meaning that there would not need to be any war.  However there was an issue with this. At the end of the Long Night the Wall was created to keep the White Walkers from travelling within the realms of men. The icy souls of the White Walkers could not pass beyond the magic of the Wall - meaning that they would have to remain in the Lands of Always Winter.  Desperately craving some way to access the world beyond the Wall Princess Anastaszia searched for many years for a solution to the problem that lay before her. There were many attempts that she tried all of which failed. It was only as she grew older that the princess soon came to realise the sacrifice that would have to be taken in order to breach the magic of the Wall.  Contrary to Warm-Blood belief White Walkers do not live forever. While the rumours of their vulnerabilty to dragon glass and Valyrian steel are true they do also die natural deaths. However they have much more extended lifespans than humans.  White Walkers do have souls and when a White Walker dies their soul becomes one with the stars and snow - uniting itself with the icy realm from whence they came. It is the magic of the White Walker’s souls that prevents them from being able to travel beyond the Wall.  Having realised that this is in fact the hinderance that keeps her from travelling beyond the Wall and knowing that this travel is the only thing that may ever bring a peace between White Walkers and Warm-Bloods Anastaszia sacrificed her own soul to the magic of the Weir Wood trees. This has turned her into an amortal being; having now lost the abiltiy to die.  Anastaszia has recently been crowned Queen Regnant of the White Walkers. She now balances ruling her kingdom with making friends and alliances with Warm-Bloods around the world. While sacrificing her soul has not cost the queen her powers there have of course been lasting consequences; ones that even she cannot yet foresee.,2024-07-10 05:49:29 GMT

I decided to be quirky and make her team green despite her origins. also she’s kinda an asshole here’s her lore it’s not super detailed just yet but I’ll write more cause I’m really liking this character 😈  —–     Maegelle is the youngest daughter of Corlys Velaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen named after Rhaenys’ cousin she is two and seven years old (27). Maegelle inherited her mother’s fieryness and quick wit she is quick to anger and quick to change emotions like the ocean throughout the day calm one second and then dangerous another unpredictable but intelligent - a true Velaryon through and through.      Her mother’s fire and the salt of her father’s blood run heavily through her in a concoction that creates drama. Growing up she had a strong relationship with her uncle Vaemond who doted on her - his prideful nature rubbing off on her eventually. He taught her about the glory of her house of old Valyria and how their house came to be here in Westeros after the doom.      Maegelle has her own dragon that she bonded with through years of feeding it fish that she would gather or steal from her father’s ship at a young age a tempermental she-dragon called Embarion whom inhabited the area around Driftmark before Maegelle Embarion would often either eat the bodies of sailors that washed ashore eat fish and sometimes even prey upon sailors at sea. Her scales are the most magnificent shade of deep sea blue with wings that are tinted a lighter shade of blue she has deep red eyes that look black until close or when the sun light hits her. Embarion is a little larger than her mother’s dragon Meleys having of hatched decades before. Maegelle is often away from court on different journeys and patrols making her extremely disconnected from most of her family.     Maegelle was once married when she was younger to a lesser lord who served as a knight for her house she had fallen deeply in love with him. She met him during the war in the Stepstones at the beginning of it - as she lended aid with her dragon alongside her brothers Seasmoke before Daemons involvement. Maegelle was allowed to marry him due to her being their third child growing up she had a lot less expectation put on her. Despite being a woman she often accompanied her father and uncle on patrols and excursions following behind on Embarion or enjoying herself at sea on the ships.      Unfortunately her husband lost his life during the war and she has remained widowed since and jaded after later events happened she believes that as soon as Daemon joined their efforts that the war was cursed despite it being won.      Both parents worry that by challenging her due to her quick anger that she will turn against them never coming back. With every death in her life making her more rageful. Any efforts to challenge her have often resulted in her disappearing for weeks on time causing both Corlys and Rhaenys deep heartache due to the loss of their previous children they both hoped that with age she will begin to calm down.      She has been haunted by the losses of all her other siblings and those around her Maegelle has a deep hatred towards both Daemon and Rhaenyra believing that they did something in not just Laenors timely death but also her sisters. Maegelle realised and concluded after his funeral that perhaps also Laena’s death was caused by the two and their constant scheming after all they coincidentally married days after her sweet brothers death. She now believes anything that involves Daemon is probably nefarious in one way or another and Rhaenyra is no better. Any efforts throughout the years by the two to gain some sort of neutral background has gone wasted.     Maegelle is now after the deaths of both her siblings and many loved ones is often cautiously doted upon by her mother and father she is allowed to live as freely as a woman in Westeros can with a few other liberties thanks to Embarion she has openly refused proposals since the death of her husband. Despite being the last living child of the Sea Snake she remains unnamed as Lady of the Tide due to her gender which makes her heavily bitter. When Lucerys was named heir instead of her she left on dragonback for and seemingly disappeared returning only to her uncles petition against the act much to her parents anguish. Over time especially after Vaemonds death she has had resentment build towards her parents.     The final straw for her was the death of her beloved uncle Vaemond. She was present at his sudden death by the sword of Daemon Maegelle had to be held back when it happened screaming and crying upon the sight of him being killed for the truth. She swore then that she would never align herself to them both even if for her fathers sake.     During Viserys death she was still in Kings Landing still mourning the death of her uncle during the commotion she immediately prepared to declare herself to his cause after all she had been put through by Daemon and Rhaenyra Maegelle outright refused to align herself to any effort that either Rhaenyra or Daemon proposed even if it meant betraying any future decision her father would make on who he would declare for. She was almost turned away as they barely knew her only having heard stories and rumours her presence was ever-fleeting after all only ever there during funerals and important events.      The fact she had Embarion though swayed their opinion on that fateful night.      —–     Thats all for now!! I’m gonna build more on her because I love to roleplay as complicated characters     TLDR everyone’s dead and she hates Daemon,2024-07-10 05:24:24 GMT

Except apparently write Aemond x Reader smut about how it’s too hot.  tags: heterosexual sex fingering sex outdoors aemond speaking High Valyrian cause it’s sexy Vhagar being sassy in the background.   ———————————-⚔️—————————————–  “Gods how can you stand to wear that?”  You felt ten times hotter just looking at your husband dressed in his traditional black &amp; leathers as he sat next to you while you baked in this heat. Even with all the windows and curtains open dressed in the thinnest dress that modesty could cling to and servants fanning you both like Dornish aristocracy you still felt like you were melting.  “It is all a matter of perspective my dear wife.” Aemond replied. Not looking up from his book. “And will power.”  You groan and drop your own book spreading out as far as your limbs would go on the chaise. You despised these hot summers. Everything was hot. Everything you touched including yourself was sticky. You felt like every breath was drawing in more hot air which in turn made you hotter and considerably cranky. It was too hot to do anything.  Aemond glanced up at you with his good eye then closed his books. The servants scatter when the prince stood. Taking away what little precious if fruitless relief you had. “Are you really that miserable?” He asked leaning over you with one arm pressed against the back of the chaise.  “Just look at me.”  “I am.” His mouth coiled into a smirk as he leaned further down to kiss you.  But you turn your head away with an unsatisfied huff. “It’s too hot.” Though you loved Aemond unconditionally apparently it had its limits. He’d have to wait until the sun went down at the very least before you would consider touching him.  The prince huffed. “Fine. Get up.”  &lt;!-- more --&gt; You didn’t have time to ask Aemond why before he was grabbing your hand and hoisting you to your feet. Dragging you along behind him as you tried to keep up with his impressive gait thanks to those long legs.  Your protests &amp; questions stopped halfway through your journey and Aemond finally let your hand go once the two of you reached the Dragonpit. Vhagar’s indominable frame taking up most of the space a lotted to her as she coolly acknowledged her rider then settled back down. “What are we doing here?”  “Leaving the city.” Aemond was already mounting Vhagar. Settled into her saddle before he reached out to you with his hand.  You often dreamed of being a dragon rider. To be up in the skies. To command giants. But you didn’t have the blood for it. Instead you just admired them from afar. “I thought you said Vhagar didn’t like secondary riders.”  “Vhagar does not like any rider but me.” He clarified. “But she will not harm you. Trust me.”  You did trust Aemond. Still you glance over to Vhagar looking into her giant eye for permission who looked back at you for a long moment before she blinked with her inner lid and turned her gaze from you. You took that as a yes and grabbed Aemond’s hand.  He hoisted you up into the saddle with ease. Seating you in front of him. His legs on either side of you as he fastened you both to the harness before taking the reins. “sōvēs Vhagar.”  The dragon rose from her seat. Seeming annoyed about it but you couldn’t be sure. She took three long strides before her wings were aloft and you were up in the air. You close your eyes tight. Gripping Aemon’s thighs on either side as you felt your stomach try to drop all the way back to the ground. “Open your eyes.” Aemond’s voice brushed against your ear louder than the rushing air around you. You do as he says. With one at first then opening both to see the beautiful bright sky around you and white fluffy clouds. It was breath taking.  You aren’t brave enough to look down but after a while Aemond shouted “tegot Vhagar” and the dragon circled around a patch of Earth before gracefully hurling itself towards it.  When you landed Aemond undid your bindings and jumped down. He held his arms out towards you waiting for you to jump and easily caught you when you fell into his open arms. “Where are we Aemond?”  The prince shrugged “somewhere North.” That was all he said before he stalked off into the woods past the clearing.  You look around and admire the beauty of the small forest before you follow after your husband. Vhagar seemed fine on her own to resume her nap while you both went on your walk to wherever Aemond was going. “Aemond what are we doing here?”  “You said you were hot.” He told you. In a tone that implied ‘we just talked about this’ as he cut through the path.  “Yes. But why are we here?” It was significantly cooler but still summer. The balminess of the city had been replaced with the natural humidity of the trees. One evil for a lesser one.  Aemond didn’t answer this time and instead pushed past the last of the greenery to reveal a second clearing. Sun dappled with trees and flowers circling a natural freshwater pond in a perfect idyllic scene. “Gods…It’s beautiful.”  “We did not come all this way just to look at it.”  You turn to Aemond to see him already unbuttoning his jerkin. “You cannot be serious.” Apparently he was as he was already tossing his jerkin aside and pulling off his under tunic. “Aemond?? We’re in the middle of nowhere!”  “Exactly. No one will find us.” His belt boots and pants quickly made it into the pile. His small clothes next. Then finally his eye patch. “Are you coming or not?” You stare at Aemond a little slack jawed as he stood there completely naked. As if you were the crazy one for not joining him.  Fingers carefully come up to your lacings. Fumbling with the strings as your embarrassment makes the digits unable to cooperate properly. Aemond was right no one would see you. But this was still the first time you had been naked ‘in public’. Ladies did not go around the world in the nude. Although apparently a Targaryen’s woman did.  Aemond grinned as he watched you let loose your dress then walked backwards a few paces before he turned and walked over to one of the rocks. Standing on it like some Valyrian statue before he jumped in. You were not nearly as brave and shyly stepped into the water from its calm shore with your hands protecting your modesty.  The water was like ice on your overheated skin but it felt so good! You let out a sigh and relax. Sinking neck deep into the water as you pulled your knees to your chest to float. “Feeling better?” You turn to look at Aemond as he swam up to you. His long hair floating behind him like a silver net. Looking more triton than dragon at the moment. You offer him a soft smile and nod.  The prince smiled back. Then he floated to his center before he stood able to reach the bottom and have the water just barely brush past his navel. “Can I kiss you now?”  You looked up at Aemond who was looking back down at you waiting for an answer. Your smile broadens and you release your knees to stand on your own feet as well. The water just barely kissing your breasts in comparison. “Yes Aemond you can kiss me.”  He looked so pleased. As if all this effort was worth it as he took your chin in his fingers to tilt your lips to his. You moan at the first contact of his tongue against yours. Hells…how long had it been since you kissed him properly.  You had not been joking when you said it was too hot to do anything. That included laying with your husband. Though you shared the same bed the most you had done for the past weeks was brief kisses &amp; touches before shunting off to your separate corners of the mattress. Desperate not to add anymore heat to your person.  Now that you were cooled off a renewed heat was swelling up inside you. “Aemond…”  The man in question pulled back just a hair’s breadth to look at you. The hand once tilting up your chin now brushing water droplets from your cheek. “I have missed you issa jorrāelagon.”  “I know.” And you felt guilty for that. “I’ve missed you too.” Together seperately had been the way things had been with this heat. But now you were somewhere cool calm and secluded with your husband.  You latch on to Aemond like a drowning man. His body your life raft. His kiss your air. He pulled you in with equal fervor and you felt his longing press against your belly. Hot and hard despite the cold water. “Aemond…” You gasp again. Intentionally brushing against him to feel more of his manhood and eager to have not against your belly but inside it. “Please…”  The prince growled and kissed you again. His teeth nipping possessively at your lips this time before he pulled you into his arms and wrapped your legs around him. Carrying you out of the water with ease and laying you on the soft grass that would be your marriage bed for the afternoon.  Aemond continued to kiss you. Letting you go for a moment before peppering your lips face and neck with more kisses. As if he couldn’t decide what he wanted to do next with you. “You should be like this at all times.”  “Underneath you?” You respond cheekily.  “Naked.” He corrected. Your head tipping back as his arm slipped betwixt you and his fingers began toying with your sex. “You wouldn’t be so hot. And we would no longer have to deal with those ridiculous laces.”  “I don’t think your mother would appreciate such a ‘casual’ manner of dress at court.” You gasp sharply as two of Aemond’s fingers suddenly slipped inside you. Clearly a diversion in the conversation as he doesn’t want to talk about his mother right now.  “Hmmm…it is probably for the best. I’d gouge out the eye of any man who would look at you besides me. Then I would no longer be unique.”  “Certainly less fashionable.” Another sharp gasp escapes you as Aemond’s fingers curled up inside you against that spot that made you see stars. Silently telling you that if you didn’t stop with the cheek you were going to get it. ‘Good’ you thought.  His fingers continued to work you open as his mouth swallowed your cries. “Aemond!” You shouted when his thumb brushed against your pearl. Pushing at his shoulders while your legs shook at the intense feeling but he wouldn’t stop. He let you go long enough to let your climax cry come out clearly. Loud and pure. Birds fluttering off in the distance that were startled by the sound.  “You’re so beautiful when you quake for me.”  “Only you.”  Your hand came up to stroke his face. Hard lines. Soft expression. Your fingertip brushes against just the end of his scar before trailing down to flick his bottom lip. Red and swollen from your kissing. Vibrant against his cool alabaster skin. Perfect.  “Make me quake for you again my love.” Your legs splayed wide for him. Making space for him and his cock in your drooling cunt.  Aemond doesn’t have to be told anything twice and he descended on you. Lining up his cock pushing it inside you with coiled control just waiting to snap waiting there until you were ready. You let him know you were ready by jutting your hips a bit. Your prince looking at your face for a moment to make sure before that coiled control snapped clean.  The two of you rut in the forest like animals. Grunting and moaning and the wet sound of slapping skin. Aemond spread your legs wider for him. Letting him thrust harder and deeper into you. Your head fell back against the damp grass. The sweet smell mixed with your sweat making you dizzy while the sharp climb towards a second climax made you lightheaded.  You will your eyes open to look at Aemond. His eye fixed only on you. Almost completely black like the stories portrayed him. Black enough that it looked as though it had bled into his sapphire. But this was not the eyes of a monster but a beast. Your beast. Your one and only as this look as just for you.  “A-Aemond!” You shout again. Fingers clenched in his wet tresses. Whole body shaking around him this time. Aemond’s teeth clenched to the point they look like they might break before he buried his face in the crook of your neck. His own hips stuttered as his warmth filled you up.  The two of you laid there for a moment. Catching your breath. Sated in one another until Aemond likely feels he’s too heavy for you and rolls off you to the side. “We should head back.”  You turn your head to look at him. Wounded. Did it have to be right now? “The sun will be setting soon. It will not be as hot upon our return.”  You look back up at the sky and indeed see the shadows had gotten longer since your arrival. “Must we?”  Aemond chuckled at your plea. Rolling back over to your side to coil his body around you like a serpent. Head on your shoulder. You know he had missed this almost as much as the other. “Not right now.” He agreed. “But soon. We can come back whenever you’d like though.”  “Tomorrow?” He laughed again.  “Whenever you’d like.”  The two of you bask in the moment and beautiful scenery for a little while longer. Enjoying the cool and the quite before you had to return to the hot and the mayhem. You dress in silence. Then Aemond walked you both back down the path towards his dragon. Vhagar not seeming to notice one way or the other that you’ve been gone.  The heat hits you instantly once you break the perimeter of the city. Cooler than before but still sweltering. “I’m going to take a cool bath before bed.” You tell your prince as he gave his dragon a few goodbye pet before he left her for the day. “Care to join me?”  Only one thing could pull Aemond’s attention away from his dragon and he turned to look over his shoulder at you with a smug grin. “Missing me already issa jorrāelagon.”  “Oh yes.” You playfully agree as you walk backwards when Aemond came close. “I don’t know. Something about dragon riding puts me in the mood for….‘dragon riding’.”  The true rider grinned and closed the gap between you with quick ease. “Why do you think I seem never to want to keep my hands off you?” He pulled you in for a new kiss. Passionate yes but not nearly as fierce as before. You were back in the walls. Back in your cages. You had to be restrained lest other people talked.

97,House of the Dragon,['aegon ii targaryen'  'hotd'  'long post'  'hotd spoilers'  'hotd critical'  'hotd discussion'  'hotd aegon'  'i do not like woobification'],synchodai,just an aegon ii rant The thing about Aegon that makes people root for him more than Joffrey is that Aegon just seems like everyone’s punching bag in a way that Joffrey wasn’t?   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Aegon did horrible things don’t get me wrong. He raped a woman he bullied his younger brother he’s implied to have his bastard children join fighting pits (this was never outright confirmed — Arryk only lightly alluded to Aegon doing something shady while they were looking to crown him) and he executed innocent ratcatchers as retribution for his murdered son.  But his rap sheet isn’t any worse than Daemon’s (murder grooming being a cop etc.) or Criston’s (his murder of Joffrey Lonmouth was downright homophobia /jk) or even Rhaenys’s (talk about killing innocent people right?) but for some reason all the characters hate Aegon’s guts specifically? Given the people on this show why?  It’s like if Joffrey Baratheon threatened to kill Arya’s direwolf and her best friend in episode 1 but he never does anything extraordinarily malicious or sadistic in the next episodes after that. And yet his own family just keeps treating him with outright contempt anyways despite him being their key to power.   Yeah Aegon should be shamed and punished by the narrative for the horrible things he does…but nothing ever going his way and emphasizing how much of failure he is at every turn is just overkill man. At some point this amount of narrative humiliation has nothing to do anymore with dealing with the consequences of his bad actions or his personal failings and it just makes every character look like they’re taking turns unloading their frustrations on an acceptable target.   It’s not fun to watch someone get kicked around by their entire family for no reason when he’s never done anything especially horrible to hurt them other than be somewhat gormless. Otto most likely doesn’t even know or care about Dyana so does he despise his grandson simply for being a drunkard? For having an addiction? He was plotting to install him as king but all they ever did to prepare him for it was….yell at him and slap him around?   And on Aegon tormenting Aemond with his bullying it’s not like Aemond especially hates humiliating people in public since he regularly does it himself. When Lucaerys smirked at Aemond when they were served a pig in that dinner scene Aemond bullied Jacaerys and Lucaerys back and Aegon was on his brother’s side defending Aemond from getting attacked. Aemond isn’t some put-upon victim who’s been tolerating his brother’s constant abuse — he obviously punches back. He has a hair-trigger temper and has messed up more things for his family’s plans than Aegon has. Aemond’s the one who was involved in the Driftmark fight that almost implicated Alicent for treason Aemond’s the one who made the Strong toast Aemond’s the one who killed Lucaerys and damaged their cause. And all three times Aegon defends him!  This is all to ask why? Why are they writing his character like this? Why does the story and other characters keep piling on this dude? Why make Aegon’s family hate him? Why make him awful at everything and good at nothing not even riding his dragon who he has had for over a decade? Why give him these almost sympathetic moments with his brother son smallfolk and dragon only to have all the characters not show him a lick of sympathy?   Why do they all hate him for being an incompetent king when he straight up gave them the option of him abdicating by running away to Essos? They all act like he’s the one imposing his incompetence on them but they’re the ones who forced the position on him. “Every man on that council earned their seat.” YEs Aegon didn’t earn his seat — because it was forced on him and I am clawing at my eyes wishing the show would acknowledge that!  Is it supposed to be a deliberate commentary on the tragedy of hereditary monarchy? To show the Hightowers’ cycle of abuse (even though no other Hightower is getting consistently hit and berated even after committing the WORST crime)? Is the show making him so pathetic and incompetent to make Rhaenyra more dignified and regal in comparison? Or is it doing this deliberately to woobify Aegon? To have his family and life be horrible so the viewers have built up their sympathies for when he gets his emotionally-resonant plot beats in the end?   Even if that’s the case the means certainly don’t justify the ends. There’s just no logical consistency to how these chracters treat and view Aegon and it’s getting frustrating to watch sometimes.,2024-07-10 05:10:39 GMT

Aegon looked around and smiled “Drinks for all a pleasure from the crown!” As he spoke the patrons erupted into cheers whoops and hollers. He leads his followers to a table patting on a particular squire’s back. “This night is for you!” He cheered along with many other things. The group had been 3 pitchers of wine down once they decided they were fit to head to the brothel. A new squire was joining the Kingsguard a young man named Harrison.  “I still refuse to believe you’ve never bed a woman before squire. Your appearance doesn’t lack” Aegon said motioning to the boy.   “I guess I never really sought it out your Grace” he replied.  ”Bullshit!” He called out taking another drink from his cup of wine. The king pressed him further demanding a more clear response.   “Truly your Grace. I don’t understand the big issue here.”  ”The issue is that I need a Kingsguard full of men. Tonight you shall become one!” Aegon shouted as he stood up. “Come I want to talk as we walk.”  Harrison stood and walked towards the King his followers grinning and snickering at him. “Yes your Grace?” He asked.  Aegon slung his hand over Harrison’s shoulder quickly pulling him in closer. “Tell me what is your type?”   “Well I’m not sure” Harrison said a lump in his throat. “Blonde?”  ”Blonde okay. There’s a couple of fine whores here who are blonde any of them are fine to suit your taste” Aegon said pushing through the doors that lead into another circular floor with a dozen rooms covered with sheer curtains.   “Do you come here often your Grace?” Harrison asked.   “The King doesn’t need to share his secrets with his Kingsguard. Now tell me which would you like?” He asked motioning to an array of women sitting on couches in the center of the room. Blondes brunettes and redheads lay over each other fawning over the King.   “Your Grace as embarrassing as this is to admit none of them are my time.”  The King sat and thought for a moment contemplating. “Do you favor men?” He asked. He couldn’t think of any other reason as to why Harrison wouldn’t give him an answer.  The squire’s face turned red he looked to the floor and back up at his king. “Yes your Grace.”  ”We are in a brothel full of women there is nothing for you here.”  ”Yes” he affirms.   Aegon thought to himself and smiled. “Come.”  He grabbed Harrison’s arm and pulled him towards a room shutting the curtains as they entered.  ”Your Grace what is the meaning of this?” Harrison asked. He stood in the middle of the room. It was fairly empty with nothing except a bed and a nightstand in the corner.   ”You said you favored men” he began. “The King doesn’t share his secrets with his Kingsguard.” He slurred slightly as he spoke his hair pushed behind his ears exposing his features.  Harrison swallowed tightly looking at the King. “Are you insinuating you and I…?”  ”Why are you acting so surprised?” Aegon asked he stood in front of the shorter man and pushed him lightly so he fell back onto the bed. “Did you not think your King swung your way?”  ”No your Grace.”  ”I would hope not” he smiled. He started to slide off his coat dropping it to the floor and doing the same with his pants. ”Take your clothes off.” He instructed.  Harrison nodded quickly fumbling with his coat buttons and eventually getting it off following suit with his pants. The both of them sat there with nothing but their undergarments on. Harrison felt awkward almost hiding himself from the King’s gaze.   “Why do you hide yourself?” Aegon asked untying his underwear’s laces and dropping them. His cock sprung twitching slightly from meeting the cold air. “Come closer.” He commanded.   Harrison scooted closer to the edge of the bed his cock begging to be set free from his underwear.   He looked shocked at the King’s member the size intimidating. Aegon positioned himself in front of Harrison’s mouth smiling. “Open”  Harrison opened his mouth staring up at Aegon as he shoved his cock into Harrison’s mouth. His eyes widened slightly trying to adjust to the feeling.   Aegon started to move his hips placing his hand on the back of Harrison’s head. “Even your mouth is perfect isn’t it? Fuck” he gasped.   Harrison refocused beginning to bob his head in rhythm with Aegon’s hips. He swirled his tongue around Aegon’s cock sucking on the tip causing the King to let out a loud moan.   “You’re doing such a good job keep going” Aegon said throwing his head back as Harrison hollowed his cheeks and bobbed his head faster.  Harrison felt the twitch on his tongue as he began to go faster. Aegon gripped his hair tightly as he began to thrust harder and harder reaching his climax.   Aegon felt his knot burst releasing threads of cum into Harrison’s mouth. His legs shook as he stood releasing moans he didn’t think he’d ever made before.   Aegon pulled his cock free the tip flushed red. “Are you sure you have never done that before?” He asked Harrison looking down.  Harrison stared up at him trying to swallow the cum in his mouth. His brown curls stuck to his face. Cum dripped from his lips as he shook his head no. “No your Grace” he said wiping his face with the back of his hand. “Are you satisfied?”   “More than” Aegon said. He contemplated for a moment before speaking. “Get on your back.”  Harrison swallowed nodding. He scooted back further on the bed lying down. “What do you plan to do your Grace?”   Aegon grabbed Harrison’s underwear and yanked them off. “Let’s get rid of these yeah?” Aegon said. He lifted Harrison’s legs and rested them on his shoulders. “You’re eager aren’t you?”   Harrison flushed as Aegon grabbed his face shoving his fingers into his mouth. “Suck.”  Harrison did just that sucking hard. After a few moments Aegon pulled his fingers free then positioned them at Harrison’s entrance. “This might hurt a little” he said shoving his middle finger into his hole moving in and out slowly.   As he did this Harrison gasped and bucked his hips from the sudden pressure. “A little?” He stuttered out his mouth hanging open slightly moaning as Aegon shoved another finger in.  ”You little whore. You love it don’t you?” Aegon asked grinning. Harrison nodded quickly.  He grinned spitting into his hand. He pumped his cock a few times pushing his tip into Harrison slowly. He watched as the younger man gasped rolling his eyes back.   Aegon pushed further his thighs clenching as his cock was being squeezed. “You’re so tight” he commented.  Harrison was a mumbling mess he felt a mixture of both euphoria and pain as Aegon moved his hips faster. “Faster please Aegon” he whined legs shaking. Aegon grinned grabbing Harrison’s cock in his hand and pumping it quickly quickening the pace of his hips as he did so.   They were both a moaning mess Harrison’s eyes brimming with tears of pleasure. “I’m going to cum” he whined. “Please don’t stop” he cried out. His back arched and his legs shook as Aegon pumped his cock and moved in and out of him.  Aegon grinned. “You can cum it’s alright” he assured. Watching the man under him crumble and shake at his whim aroused him to a new height. He felt the cock in his hand twitch and heard Harrison let out a cry as he came spurts of cum covering his hand.   “Aegon” Harrison whined bucking his hips and riding out his orgasm. “Oh my god.” Aegon continued to pump his cock causing Harrison to form tears and beg for him to stop.  Aegon’s orgasm followed suit he thrusted his hips faster his cock twitching and filling Harrison with his cum. He collapsed onto Harrison’s chest breathing heavily. “It has been too long since I’ve been with a man. I’ve missed it.” Aegon said into Harrisons’ chest his cock sliding out and cum spilling.  “I’m glad I could be of service my King.”  “You keep up with the formality like I didn’t just fuck you squire.”  “Is there an issue with that? I assumed you liked being referred to by your proper title” Harrison replied throwing his arm around Aegons back. His legs shook as his cock rubbed against Aegons stomach.   “You can call me by my name.”  “If you insist.”,2024-07-10 04:55:25 GMT

Name: Anastaszia Nivalis  Age: 22 in human years.  Title: Queen of the White Walkers. Queen of the Kingdom of Always Winter. The Snow Queen.  Backstory:  White Walkers known by some as The Cold Ones or The Others are an ancient species of mythical beings who inhabit the icy tundra beyond the Wall in Westeros in a kingdom known as the Lands of Always Winter. They are ethereal creatures similar to faeries or elves (the Sidhe made of ice) who have the power to control snow and ice as well as the ability to raise the dead turning them into subservient creatures known as Wights.  Head of the White Walkers is the Night King absolute monarch of the Kingdom of Always Winter. Turned into the First White Walker by the Children of the Forest using a cursed dragon glass dagger the Night King has ruled his people for the past ten thousand years.  While the Night King has created many White Walkers of his own all of whom take up varying important roles in his kingdom he has only one true child; his only daughter the only White Walker to share his blood thus making her the heir to his throne - Crown Princess Anastaszia.  Anastaszia Nivalis is the only trueborn child of the Night King. The word ‘trueborn’ takes on a different meaning in White Walker culture than it does in Westeros. While their ‘trueborn’ means legitimate - born to two married parents - in the Lands of Always Winter it has a much more literal meaning. For you see rather than having been created through magic as her ‘brothers’ were Anastaszia was born in the same way that a human would be.  Because of this she was granted the same powers as her father - and also has his royal blood running through her veins. This by the laws of their kingdom makes her the second true White Walker and also makes her the only one fit to be heir to the Ice Throne.  She has naturally lived a very privileged upbringing because of this. From birth she has been lauded as special her life’s purpose being to one day take the throne and become a great leader as her father is.  Anastaszia grew up within the Ice Palace receiving a formal education meant to prepare her for leadership. She was taught arithmetic languages social etiquette diplomacy and various other lessons that would be expected of a future Queen Regnant to know. As she grew older the princess would also sit in on royal council meetings held by her father and his advisors giving her the opportunity to voice her own opinions on matters of state.  She also spent many hours hunting horseback riding and being trained how to use her mythical abilities - and while she has mastered these to a great extent there are some that she still can struggle with from time to time something which is often a cause of great embarrassment to her.  The Crown Princess is doted upon by her father who adores his only child to the point of almost spoiling her. She has a positive relationship with her family and has always been encouraged to be the best version of herself that she can.  From early childhood Anastaszia has been fascinated by the culture of the creatures who exist beyond her kingdom - Warm-Bloods. Warm-Bloods (the name by which White Walkers refer to humans have been a source of contention within the Lands of Always Winter for some time. When the Night King and his people turned on the Children of the Forest - seeking their own independence from the Children of the Forest and to no longer be used as weapons.  This lead to what is historically known as the Long Night - which culminated in the Battle for the Dawn which is what lead to the creation of the Wall and the establishment of the Night’s Watch. Anastaszia was an infant during the Long Night and has no memory of it though in the subsequent years that followed she of course was educated on what happened and the significance this had on her people.  There have been tensions between Warm-Bloods and White Walkers since further back than Anastaszia can remember. With the passage of time White Walkers faded into obscurity becoming something of a myth - an old wives’ tale to scare children with. Meanwhile Anastaszia received a basic education - as much as could be provided - about Warm-Blood culture. The more she learned about it the more fascinated she became.  During the hours that she and her ice-horses would ride further into the Southern hemisphere Anastaszia began to collect several little trinkets belonging to the Warm-Blood realm. She keeps these collections on a shelf in her royal bedchambers and likes to add more and more to it as often as she can.  It was always a dream of Anastaszia’s to travel South one day to go beyond the Wall and visit the species that she has dedicated so much of her life to learning about. A dream that she often spoke to her father about. And while the Night King deep down also hopes that peace may be possible between the two realms he has become rather cynical towards Warm-Bloods having fought against them before. But when his beloved young daughter began speaking so warmly about them and their cultures the Night King came to hope that the Princess might be the one to broker peace between the species meaning that there would not need to be any war.  However there was an issue with this. At the end of the Long Night the Wall was created to keep the White Walkers from travelling within the realms of men. The icy souls of the White Walkers could not pass beyond the magic of the Wall - meaning that they would have to remain in the Lands of Always Winter.  Desperately craving some way to access the world beyond the Wall Princess Anastaszia searched for many years for a solution to the problem that lay before her. There were many attempts that she tried all of which failed. It was only as she grew older that the princess soon came to realise the sacrifice that would have to be taken in order to breach the magic of the Wall.  Contrary to Warm-Blood belief White Walkers do not live forever. While the rumours of their vulnerabilty to dragon glass and Valyrian steel are true they do also die natural deaths. However they have much more extended lifespans than humans.  White Walkers do have souls and when a White Walker dies their soul becomes one with the stars and snow - uniting itself with the icy realm from whence they came. It is the magic of the White Walker’s souls that prevents them from being able to travel beyond the Wall.  Having realised that this is in fact the hinderance that keeps her from travelling beyond the Wall and knowing that this travel is the only thing that may ever bring a peace between White Walkers and Warm-Bloods Anastaszia sacrificed her own soul to the magic of the Weir Wood trees. This has turned her into an amortal being; having now lost the abiltiy to die.  Anastaszia has recently been crowned Queen Regnant of the White Walkers. She now balances ruling her kingdom with making friends and alliances with Warm-Bloods around the world. While sacrificing her soul has not cost the queen her powers there have of course been lasting consequences; ones that even she cannot yet foresee.,2024-07-10 05:49:29 GMT

I decided to be quirky and make her team green despite her origins. also she’s kinda an asshole here’s her lore it’s not super detailed just yet but I’ll write more cause I’m really liking this character 😈  —–     Maegelle is the youngest daughter of Corlys Velaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen named after Rhaenys’ cousin she is two and seven years old (27). Maegelle inherited her mother’s fieryness and quick wit she is quick to anger and quick to change emotions like the ocean throughout the day calm one second and then dangerous another unpredictable but intelligent - a true Velaryon through and through.      Her mother’s fire and the salt of her father’s blood run heavily through her in a concoction that creates drama. Growing up she had a strong relationship with her uncle Vaemond who doted on her - his prideful nature rubbing off on her eventually. He taught her about the glory of her house of old Valyria and how their house came to be here in Westeros after the doom.      Maegelle has her own dragon that she bonded with through years of feeding it fish that she would gather or steal from her father’s ship at a young age a tempermental she-dragon called Embarion whom inhabited the area around Driftmark before Maegelle Embarion would often either eat the bodies of sailors that washed ashore eat fish and sometimes even prey upon sailors at sea. Her scales are the most magnificent shade of deep sea blue with wings that are tinted a lighter shade of blue she has deep red eyes that look black until close or when the sun light hits her. Embarion is a little larger than her mother’s dragon Meleys having of hatched decades before. Maegelle is often away from court on different journeys and patrols making her extremely disconnected from most of her family.     Maegelle was once married when she was younger to a lesser lord who served as a knight for her house she had fallen deeply in love with him. She met him during the war in the Stepstones at the beginning of it - as she lended aid with her dragon alongside her brothers Seasmoke before Daemons involvement. Maegelle was allowed to marry him due to her being their third child growing up she had a lot less expectation put on her. Despite being a woman she often accompanied her father and uncle on patrols and excursions following behind on Embarion or enjoying herself at sea on the ships.      Unfortunately her husband lost his life during the war and she has remained widowed since and jaded after later events happened she believes that as soon as Daemon joined their efforts that the war was cursed despite it being won.      Both parents worry that by challenging her due to her quick anger that she will turn against them never coming back. With every death in her life making her more rageful. Any efforts to challenge her have often resulted in her disappearing for weeks on time causing both Corlys and Rhaenys deep heartache due to the loss of their previous children they both hoped that with age she will begin to calm down.      She has been haunted by the losses of all her other siblings and those around her Maegelle has a deep hatred towards both Daemon and Rhaenyra believing that they did something in not just Laenors timely death but also her sisters. Maegelle realised and concluded after his funeral that perhaps also Laena’s death was caused by the two and their constant scheming after all they coincidentally married days after her sweet brothers death. She now believes anything that involves Daemon is probably nefarious in one way or another and Rhaenyra is no better. Any efforts throughout the years by the two to gain some sort of neutral background has gone wasted.     Maegelle is now after the deaths of both her siblings and many loved ones is often cautiously doted upon by her mother and father she is allowed to live as freely as a woman in Westeros can with a few other liberties thanks to Embarion she has openly refused proposals since the death of her husband. Despite being the last living child of the Sea Snake she remains unnamed as Lady of the Tide due to her gender which makes her heavily bitter. When Lucerys was named heir instead of her she left on dragonback for and seemingly disappeared returning only to her uncles petition against the act much to her parents anguish. Over time especially after Vaemonds death she has had resentment build towards her parents.     The final straw for her was the death of her beloved uncle Vaemond. She was present at his sudden death by the sword of Daemon Maegelle had to be held back when it happened screaming and crying upon the sight of him being killed for the truth. She swore then that she would never align herself to them both even if for her fathers sake.     During Viserys death she was still in Kings Landing still mourning the death of her uncle during the commotion she immediately prepared to declare herself to his cause after all she had been put through by Daemon and Rhaenyra Maegelle outright refused to align herself to any effort that either Rhaenyra or Daemon proposed even if it meant betraying any future decision her father would make on who he would declare for. She was almost turned away as they barely knew her only having heard stories and rumours her presence was ever-fleeting after all only ever there during funerals and important events.      The fact she had Embarion though swayed their opinion on that fateful night.      —–     Thats all for now!! I’m gonna build more on her because I love to roleplay as complicated characters     TLDR everyone’s dead and she hates Daemon,2024-07-10 05:24:24 GMT

Except apparently write Aemond x Reader smut about how it’s too hot.  tags: heterosexual sex fingering sex outdoors aemond speaking High Valyrian cause it’s sexy Vhagar being sassy in the background.   ———————————-⚔️—————————————–  “Gods how can you stand to wear that?”  You felt ten times hotter just looking at your husband dressed in his traditional black &amp; leathers as he sat next to you while you baked in this heat. Even with all the windows and curtains open dressed in the thinnest dress that modesty could cling to and servants fanning you both like Dornish aristocracy you still felt like you were melting.  “It is all a matter of perspective my dear wife.” Aemond replied. Not looking up from his book. “And will power.”  You groan and drop your own book spreading out as far as your limbs would go on the chaise. You despised these hot summers. Everything was hot. Everything you touched including yourself was sticky. You felt like every breath was drawing in more hot air which in turn made you hotter and considerably cranky. It was too hot to do anything.  Aemond glanced up at you with his good eye then closed his books. The servants scatter when the prince stood. Taking away what little precious if fruitless relief you had. “Are you really that miserable?” He asked leaning over you with one arm pressed against the back of the chaise.  “Just look at me.”  “I am.” His mouth coiled into a smirk as he leaned further down to kiss you.  But you turn your head away with an unsatisfied huff. “It’s too hot.” Though you loved Aemond unconditionally apparently it had its limits. He’d have to wait until the sun went down at the very least before you would consider touching him.  The prince huffed. “Fine. Get up.”  &lt;!-- more --&gt; You didn’t have time to ask Aemond why before he was grabbing your hand and hoisting you to your feet. Dragging you along behind him as you tried to keep up with his impressive gait thanks to those long legs.  Your protests &amp; questions stopped halfway through your journey and Aemond finally let your hand go once the two of you reached the Dragonpit. Vhagar’s indominable frame taking up most of the space a lotted to her as she coolly acknowledged her rider then settled back down. “What are we doing here?”  “Leaving the city.” Aemond was already mounting Vhagar. Settled into her saddle before he reached out to you with his hand.  You often dreamed of being a dragon rider. To be up in the skies. To command giants. But you didn’t have the blood for it. Instead you just admired them from afar. “I thought you said Vhagar didn’t like secondary riders.”  “Vhagar does not like any rider but me.” He clarified. “But she will not harm you. Trust me.”  You did trust Aemond. Still you glance over to Vhagar looking into her giant eye for permission who looked back at you for a long moment before she blinked with her inner lid and turned her gaze from you. You took that as a yes and grabbed Aemond’s hand.  He hoisted you up into the saddle with ease. Seating you in front of him. His legs on either side of you as he fastened you both to the harness before taking the reins. “sōvēs Vhagar.”  The dragon rose from her seat. Seeming annoyed about it but you couldn’t be sure. She took three long strides before her wings were aloft and you were up in the air. You close your eyes tight. Gripping Aemon’s thighs on either side as you felt your stomach try to drop all the way back to the ground. “Open your eyes.” Aemond’s voice brushed against your ear louder than the rushing air around you. You do as he says. With one at first then opening both to see the beautiful bright sky around you and white fluffy clouds. It was breath taking.  You aren’t brave enough to look down but after a while Aemond shouted “tegot Vhagar” and the dragon circled around a patch of Earth before gracefully hurling itself towards it.  When you landed Aemond undid your bindings and jumped down. He held his arms out towards you waiting for you to jump and easily caught you when you fell into his open arms. “Where are we Aemond?”  The prince shrugged “somewhere North.” That was all he said before he stalked off into the woods past the clearing.  You look around and admire the beauty of the small forest before you follow after your husband. Vhagar seemed fine on her own to resume her nap while you both went on your walk to wherever Aemond was going. “Aemond what are we doing here?”  “You said you were hot.” He told you. In a tone that implied ‘we just talked about this’ as he cut through the path.  “Yes. But why are we here?” It was significantly cooler but still summer. The balminess of the city had been replaced with the natural humidity of the trees. One evil for a lesser one.  Aemond didn’t answer this time and instead pushed past the last of the greenery to reveal a second clearing. Sun dappled with trees and flowers circling a natural freshwater pond in a perfect idyllic scene. “Gods…It’s beautiful.”  “We did not come all this way just to look at it.”  You turn to Aemond to see him already unbuttoning his jerkin. “You cannot be serious.” Apparently he was as he was already tossing his jerkin aside and pulling off his under tunic. “Aemond?? We’re in the middle of nowhere!”  “Exactly. No one will find us.” His belt boots and pants quickly made it into the pile. His small clothes next. Then finally his eye patch. “Are you coming or not?” You stare at Aemond a little slack jawed as he stood there completely naked. As if you were the crazy one for not joining him.  Fingers carefully come up to your lacings. Fumbling with the strings as your embarrassment makes the digits unable to cooperate properly. Aemond was right no one would see you. But this was still the first time you had been naked ‘in public’. Ladies did not go around the world in the nude. Although apparently a Targaryen’s woman did.  Aemond grinned as he watched you let loose your dress then walked backwards a few paces before he turned and walked over to one of the rocks. Standing on it like some Valyrian statue before he jumped in. You were not nearly as brave and shyly stepped into the water from its calm shore with your hands protecting your modesty.  The water was like ice on your overheated skin but it felt so good! You let out a sigh and relax. Sinking neck deep into the water as you pulled your knees to your chest to float. “Feeling better?” You turn to look at Aemond as he swam up to you. His long hair floating behind him like a silver net. Looking more triton than dragon at the moment. You offer him a soft smile and nod.  The prince smiled back. Then he floated to his center before he stood able to reach the bottom and have the water just barely brush past his navel. “Can I kiss you now?”  You looked up at Aemond who was looking back down at you waiting for an answer. Your smile broadens and you release your knees to stand on your own feet as well. The water just barely kissing your breasts in comparison. “Yes Aemond you can kiss me.”  He looked so pleased. As if all this effort was worth it as he took your chin in his fingers to tilt your lips to his. You moan at the first contact of his tongue against yours. Hells…how long had it been since you kissed him properly.  You had not been joking when you said it was too hot to do anything. That included laying with your husband. Though you shared the same bed the most you had done for the past weeks was brief kisses &amp; touches before shunting off to your separate corners of the mattress. Desperate not to add anymore heat to your person.  Now that you were cooled off a renewed heat was swelling up inside you. “Aemond…”  The man in question pulled back just a hair’s breadth to look at you. The hand once tilting up your chin now brushing water droplets from your cheek. “I have missed you issa jorrāelagon.”  “I know.” And you felt guilty for that. “I’ve missed you too.” Together seperately had been the way things had been with this heat. But now you were somewhere cool calm and secluded with your husband.  You latch on to Aemond like a drowning man. His body your life raft. His kiss your air. He pulled you in with equal fervor and you felt his longing press against your belly. Hot and hard despite the cold water. “Aemond…” You gasp again. Intentionally brushing against him to feel more of his manhood and eager to have not against your belly but inside it. “Please…”  The prince growled and kissed you again. His teeth nipping possessively at your lips this time before he pulled you into his arms and wrapped your legs around him. Carrying you out of the water with ease and laying you on the soft grass that would be your marriage bed for the afternoon.  Aemond continued to kiss you. Letting you go for a moment before peppering your lips face and neck with more kisses. As if he couldn’t decide what he wanted to do next with you. “You should be like this at all times.”  “Underneath you?” You respond cheekily.  “Naked.” He corrected. Your head tipping back as his arm slipped betwixt you and his fingers began toying with your sex. “You wouldn’t be so hot. And we would no longer have to deal with those ridiculous laces.”  “I don’t think your mother would appreciate such a ‘casual’ manner of dress at court.” You gasp sharply as two of Aemond’s fingers suddenly slipped inside you. Clearly a diversion in the conversation as he doesn’t want to talk about his mother right now.  “Hmmm…it is probably for the best. I’d gouge out the eye of any man who would look at you besides me. Then I would no longer be unique.”  “Certainly less fashionable.” Another sharp gasp escapes you as Aemond’s fingers curled up inside you against that spot that made you see stars. Silently telling you that if you didn’t stop with the cheek you were going to get it. ‘Good’ you thought.  His fingers continued to work you open as his mouth swallowed your cries. “Aemond!” You shouted when his thumb brushed against your pearl. Pushing at his shoulders while your legs shook at the intense feeling but he wouldn’t stop. He let you go long enough to let your climax cry come out clearly. Loud and pure. Birds fluttering off in the distance that were startled by the sound.  “You’re so beautiful when you quake for me.”  “Only you.”  Your hand came up to stroke his face. Hard lines. Soft expression. Your fingertip brushes against just the end of his scar before trailing down to flick his bottom lip. Red and swollen from your kissing. Vibrant against his cool alabaster skin. Perfect.  “Make me quake for you again my love.” Your legs splayed wide for him. Making space for him and his cock in your drooling cunt.  Aemond doesn’t have to be told anything twice and he descended on you. Lining up his cock pushing it inside you with coiled control just waiting to snap waiting there until you were ready. You let him know you were ready by jutting your hips a bit. Your prince looking at your face for a moment to make sure before that coiled control snapped clean.  The two of you rut in the forest like animals. Grunting and moaning and the wet sound of slapping skin. Aemond spread your legs wider for him. Letting him thrust harder and deeper into you. Your head fell back against the damp grass. The sweet smell mixed with your sweat making you dizzy while the sharp climb towards a second climax made you lightheaded.  You will your eyes open to look at Aemond. His eye fixed only on you. Almost completely black like the stories portrayed him. Black enough that it looked as though it had bled into his sapphire. But this was not the eyes of a monster but a beast. Your beast. Your one and only as this look as just for you.  “A-Aemond!” You shout again. Fingers clenched in his wet tresses. Whole body shaking around him this time. Aemond’s teeth clenched to the point they look like they might break before he buried his face in the crook of your neck. His own hips stuttered as his warmth filled you up.  The two of you laid there for a moment. Catching your breath. Sated in one another until Aemond likely feels he’s too heavy for you and rolls off you to the side. “We should head back.”  You turn your head to look at him. Wounded. Did it have to be right now? “The sun will be setting soon. It will not be as hot upon our return.”  You look back up at the sky and indeed see the shadows had gotten longer since your arrival. “Must we?”  Aemond chuckled at your plea. Rolling back over to your side to coil his body around you like a serpent. Head on your shoulder. You know he had missed this almost as much as the other. “Not right now.” He agreed. “But soon. We can come back whenever you’d like though.”  “Tomorrow?” He laughed again.  “Whenever you’d like.”  The two of you bask in the moment and beautiful scenery for a little while longer. Enjoying the cool and the quite before you had to return to the hot and the mayhem. You dress in silence. Then Aemond walked you both back down the path towards his dragon. Vhagar not seeming to notice one way or the other that you’ve been gone.  The heat hits you instantly once you break the perimeter of the city. Cooler than before but still sweltering. “I’m going to take a cool bath before bed.” You tell your prince as he gave his dragon a few goodbye pet before he left her for the day. “Care to join me?”  Only one thing could pull Aemond’s attention away from his dragon and he turned to look over his shoulder at you with a smug grin. “Missing me already issa jorrāelagon.”  “Oh yes.” You playfully agree as you walk backwards when Aemond came close. “I don’t know. Something about dragon riding puts me in the mood for….‘dragon riding’.”  The true rider grinned and closed the gap between you with quick ease. “Why do you think I seem never to want to keep my hands off you?” He pulled you in for a new kiss. Passionate yes but not nearly as fierce as before. You were back in the walls. Back in your cages. You had to be restrained lest other people talked. Because gods forbid a man &amp; a wife actually fancied each other. He let you go and it was your turn to lead Aemond by the hand.  The weather was hot. But summer would eventually break. By the time winter came you intended to know all sorts of new ways to keep warm.,2024-07-10 05:15:44 GMT

97,House of the Dragon,['aegon ii targaryen'  'hotd'  'long post'  'hotd spoilers'  'hotd critical'  'hotd discussion'  'hotd aegon'  'i do not like woobification'],synchodai,just an aegon ii rant The thing about Aegon that makes people root for him more than Joffrey is that Aegon just seems like everyone’s punching bag in a way that Joffrey wasn’t?   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Aegon did horrible things don’t get me wrong. He raped a woman he bullied his younger brother he’s implied to have his bastard children join fighting pits (this was never outright confirmed — Arryk only lightly alluded to Aegon doing something shady while they were looking to crown him) and he executed innocent ratcatchers as retribution for his murdered son.  But his rap sheet isn’t any worse than Daemon’s (murder grooming being a cop etc.) or Criston’s (his murder of Joffrey Lonmouth was downright homophobia /jk) or even Rhaenys’s (talk about killing innocent people right?) but for some reason all the characters hate Aegon’s guts specifically? Given the people on this show why?  It’s like if Joffrey Baratheon threatened to kill Arya’s direwolf and her best friend in episode 1 but he never does anything extraordinarily malicious or sadistic in the next episodes after that. And yet his own family just keeps treating him with outright contempt anyways despite him being their key to power.   Yeah Aegon should be shamed and punished by the narrative for the horrible things he does…but nothing ever going his way and emphasizing how much of failure he is at every turn is just overkill man. At some point this amount of narrative humiliation has nothing to do anymore with dealing with the consequences of his bad actions or his personal failings and it just makes every character look like they’re taking turns unloading their frustrations on an acceptable target.   It’s not fun to watch someone get kicked around by their entire family for no reason when he’s never done anything especially horrible to hurt them other than be somewhat gormless. Otto most likely doesn’t even know or care about Dyana so does he despise his grandson simply for being a drunkard? For having an addiction? He was plotting to install him as king but all they ever did to prepare him for it was….yell at him and slap him around?   And on Aegon tormenting Aemond with his bullying it’s not like Aemond especially hates humiliating people in public since he regularly does it himself. When Lucaerys smirked at Aemond when they were served a pig in that dinner scene Aemond bullied Jacaerys and Lucaerys back and Aegon was on his brother’s side defending Aemond from getting attacked. Aemond isn’t some put-upon victim who’s been tolerating his brother’s constant abuse — he obviously punches back. He has a hair-trigger temper and has messed up more things for his family’s plans than Aegon has. Aemond’s the one who was involved in the Driftmark fight that almost implicated Alicent for treason Aemond’s the one who made the Strong toast Aemond’s the one who killed Lucaerys and damaged their cause. And all three times Aegon defends him!  This is all to ask why? Why are they writing his character like this? Why does the story and other characters keep piling on this dude? Why make Aegon’s family hate him? Why make him awful at everything and good at nothing not even riding his dragon who he has had for over a decade? Why give him these almost sympathetic moments with his brother son smallfolk and dragon only to have all the characters not show him a lick of sympathy?   Why do they all hate him for being an incompetent king when he straight up gave them the option of him abdicating by running away to Essos? They all act like he’s the one imposing his incompetence on them but they’re the ones who forced the position on him. “Every man on that council earned their seat.” YEs Aegon didn’t earn his seat — because it was forced on him and I am clawing at my eyes wishing the show would acknowledge that!  Is it supposed to be a deliberate commentary on the tragedy of hereditary monarchy? To show the Hightowers’ cycle of abuse (even though no other Hightower is getting consistently hit and berated even after committing the WORST crime)? Is the show making him so pathetic and incompetent to make Rhaenyra more dignified and regal in comparison? Or is it doing this deliberately to woobify Aegon? To have his family and life be horrible so the viewers have built up their sympathies for when he gets his emotionally-resonant plot beats in the end?   Even if that’s the case the means certainly don’t justify the ends.

Name: Anastaszia Nivalis  Age: 22 in human years.  Title: Queen of the White Walkers. Queen of the Kingdom of Always Winter. The Snow Queen.  Backstory:  White Walkers known by some as The Cold Ones or The Others are an ancient species of mythical beings who inhabit the icy tundra beyond the Wall in Westeros in a kingdom known as the Lands of Always Winter. They are ethereal creatures similar to faeries or elves (the Sidhe made of ice) who have the power to control snow and ice as well as the ability to raise the dead turning them into subservient creatures known as Wights.  Head of the White Walkers is the Night King absolute monarch of the Kingdom of Always Winter. Turned into the First White Walker by the Children of the Forest using a cursed dragon glass dagger the Night King has ruled his people for the past ten thousand years.  While the Night King has created many White Walkers of his own all of whom take up varying important roles in his kingdom he has only one true child; his only daughter the only White Walker to share his blood thus making her the heir to his throne - Crown Princess Anastaszia.  Anastaszia Nivalis is the only trueborn child of the Night King. The word ‘trueborn’ takes on a different meaning in White Walker culture than it does in Westeros. While their ‘trueborn’ means legitimate - born to two married parents - in the Lands of Always Winter it has a much more literal meaning. For you see rather than having been created through magic as her ‘brothers’ were Anastaszia was born in the same way that a human would be.  Because of this she was granted the same powers as her father - and also has his royal blood running through her veins. This by the laws of their kingdom makes her the second true White Walker and also makes her the only one fit to be heir to the Ice Throne.  She has naturally lived a very privileged upbringing because of this. From birth she has been lauded as special her life’s purpose being to one day take the throne and become a great leader as her father is.  Anastaszia grew up within the Ice Palace receiving a formal education meant to prepare her for leadership. She was taught arithmetic languages social etiquette diplomacy and various other lessons that would be expected of a future Queen Regnant to know. As she grew older the princess would also sit in on royal council meetings held by her father and his advisors giving her the opportunity to voice her own opinions on matters of state.  She also spent many hours hunting horseback riding and being trained how to use her mythical abilities - and while she has mastered these to a great extent there are some that she still can struggle with from time to time something which is often a cause of great embarrassment to her.  The Crown Princess is doted upon by her father who adores his only child to the point of almost spoiling her. She has a positive relationship with her family and has always been encouraged to be the best version of herself that she can.  From early childhood Anastaszia has been fascinated by the culture of the creatures who exist beyond her kingdom - Warm-Bloods. Warm-Bloods (the name by which White Walkers refer to humans have been a source of contention within the Lands of Always Winter for some time. When the Night King and his people turned on the Children of the Forest - seeking their own independence from the Children of the Forest and to no longer be used as weapons.  This lead to what is historically known as the Long Night - which culminated in the Battle for the Dawn which is what lead to the creation of the Wall and the establishment of the Night’s Watch. Anastaszia was an infant during the Long Night and has no memory of it though in the subsequent years that followed she of course was educated on what happened and the significance this had on her people.  There have been tensions between Warm-Bloods and White Walkers since further back than Anastaszia can remember. With the passage of time White Walkers faded into obscurity becoming something of a myth - an old wives’ tale to scare children with. Meanwhile Anastaszia received a basic education - as much as could be provided - about Warm-Blood culture. The more she learned about it the more fascinated she became.  During the hours that she and her ice-horses would ride further into the Southern hemisphere Anastaszia began to collect several little trinkets belonging to the Warm-Blood realm. She keeps these collections on a shelf in her royal bedchambers and likes to add more and more to it as often as she can.  It was always a dream of Anastaszia’s to travel South one day to go beyond the Wall and visit the species that she has dedicated so much of her life to learning about. A dream that she often spoke to her father about. And while the Night King deep down also hopes that peace may be possible between the two realms he has become rather cynical towards Warm-Bloods having fought against them before. But when his beloved young daughter began speaking so warmly about them and their cultures the Night King came to hope that the Princess might be the one to broker peace between the species meaning that there would not need to be any war.  However there was an issue with this. At the end of the Long Night the Wall was created to keep the White Walkers from travelling within the realms of men. The icy souls of the White Walkers could not pass beyond the magic of the Wall - meaning that they would have to remain in the Lands of Always Winter.  Desperately craving some way to access the world beyond the Wall Princess Anastaszia searched for many years for a solution to the problem that lay before her. There were many attempts that she tried all of which failed. It was only as she grew older that the princess soon came to realise the sacrifice that would have to be taken in order to breach the magic of the Wall.  Contrary to Warm-Blood belief White Walkers do not live forever. While the rumours of their vulnerabilty to dragon glass and Valyrian steel are true they do also die natural deaths. However they have much more extended lifespans than humans.  White Walkers do have souls and when a White Walker dies their soul becomes one with the stars and snow - uniting itself with the icy realm from whence they came. It is the magic of the White Walker’s souls that prevents them from being able to travel beyond the Wall.  Having realised that this is in fact the hinderance that keeps her from travelling beyond the Wall and knowing that this travel is the only thing that may ever bring a peace between White Walkers and Warm-Bloods Anastaszia sacrificed her own soul to the magic of the Weir Wood trees. This has turned her into an amortal being; having now lost the abiltiy to die.  Anastaszia has recently been crowned Queen Regnant of the White Walkers. She now balances ruling her kingdom with making friends and alliances with Warm-Bloods around the world. While sacrificing her soul has not cost the queen her powers there have of course been lasting consequences; ones that even she cannot yet foresee.,2024-07-10 05:49:29 GMT

How’d it always been when kneeling to pick up a wandering spider spindly legs creeping over your fingers until crossing the bridge to hers. The two of you more focused on caring for the bugs and birds that crossed kingslanding to find you. “She’s an idiot” Aegon would grumble to his younger bother both still watching the two of you below. They’d always be watching. As the years passed and bodies grew to carry smaller ones. Your hands smoothing over the fabric of Helaena’s gown and the rounded curve of her belly. Always there and lingering while Aegon slithered away to brothels and Aemond sadly departed for classes. You would remain with her even while her siblings grew to hate yours. “I could never hate you…” her voice soft in your imagination eyes dancing over the written words of her most recent letter to you. It the early day when no light from the sun reached the tower you wrote back to her. Scribbling down on the pages and waiting for the ink to dry before sealing the letter shut. Packing a bag with toys and gifts to bring and shower the twins with. Arms open as the small bundles of white hair jumped to you. “Hello my darlings !” Strong arms hoisting the twins up as they squealed in excitement. Excitement Helaena could only join as she crept closer in. The privacy of the woods allowing the soft press of your lips to hers foreheads pressed close and tired eyes able to rest. While always loyal to your family the burden of the war grew heavy on weary shoulders. Declaring for Aegon only if it meant the safety of Everyone for what your mind planned. Even in the dead of night with another letter being written the sound of thundering feet filled the halls. The guards at your door ushering you awake as a great commotion filled the castle.  “What- what has happened !?” Came quickly from you as Helaena came into view. Jaehaera pressed tightly to her chest as you pushed past the worrying ladies “they killed the boy…” was all the words she could muster. Eyes glassy and distant even when meeting your own.  The night didn’t go much better on as emotions quickly ran high and far higher. Spending it soothing Jaehaera while Aegon came and quickly broke down. Perhaps hearing your own screams didn’t come easy as the still room made a mockery of you both.  Hand in hand looking over at the blood drenched cradle while Jaehaera slept cradled in your arms. “We should go” was all that you managed to whisper holding her hand tighter.  The sack in her free hand almost non existent as quietly the dragon pit was relieved of Dreamfyre.  Touching down and walking uninterrupted until the black council stood before. Face splattered with dried crimson and Helaena’s stained hands setting the thudding sack onto the table. The dark crown of rubies and sapphire eye spilling out with each head of silver hair in accompaniment.,2024-07-10 08:38:04 GMT

Hear me out it will be absolutely heartbreaking and it will rip out my heart but it will also make sense? Yk like a parallel with Luke’s death so it makes a perfect cliffhanger for season 3. It could happen in the last episode and then we would get a scene with Rhaenyra’s reaction (yes it would be repetitive but it wouldn’t be the same reaction). When she heard of Luke’s death we saw the raw pain in her eyes the tears but when she would hear of Jace’s death there will be pain but also so much anger at the loss of not just another child but her heir.  I mean look at the book quotes about their deaths  Luke: And with his death the war of ravens and envoys and marriage pacts came to an end and the war of fire and blood began in earnest.  Jace: Broken after the loss of one son Rhaenyra Targaryen seemed to find new strength after the loss of a second. Jace’s death hardened her burning away her fears leaving only her anger and hatred.  Jace’s death changes Rhaenyra completely. After Luke she still wanted a chance of peace but after him she is so sick of losing her family in this war that she is so determined to win it no matter how cruel she has to be. By ending the season with this is will give the viewers anticipation for what lengths she will go to in the next season. Luke’s death started the war but Jace’s death is what makes Rhaenyra want to end it in bloodshed.  (i personally hope they don’t kill him so soon bcs i love him but it would be a good parallel if they did and an epic way to end the season),2024-07-10 09:35:56 GMT

All it took was the proof of their coupling.   Curious eyes followed the rogue prince as he walked across the halls of the Red Keep.      Daemon didn’t care though he disrupted the lords of the council and pestered Viserys until they were left alone.      “You’re aware that I want Y/N your ward.” Daemon said.      He was sick and tired of being told he couldn’t have you for his bride. There was nothing that inspired his ire more than the letters to the crown asking for your hand the hand he felt belonged to him. And this godforsaken council was planning on the most suitable match for their own ambition.      Only Lord Lyonel Strong your father had a speck of good intention in his heart. He didn’t however have any authority over your wedding as the late Queen Aemma had taken a liking to you when you were a child. Your mother had been a prominent bastard Targaryen daughter and the Queen felt an especially close responsibility towards you. You became Rhaenyra’s closest companion and upon the queen’s death the ward of the King.      Daemon was thrilled when this happened could he finally have you for himself? All these years right under his nose you had blossomed into the finest young woman fit to be a princess. Aemma would’ve never allowed him to wed you but Viserys might.      So last night after you left Rhaenyra’s chambers and returned to your own Daemon found you.  It didn’t take more than him bolting the door behind him and telling you to take your dress off. His little bird was more than eager considering that she’d been waiting for this all her life. Her very own Targaryen prince a part of her identity that decided her life yet lay just out of hand’s reach.      “She’s been thoroughly bedded by me brother.” Daemon smirked. He unfurled the ball of fabric in his hand to reveal sheets suggestively streaked with blood. Presumably your maidenblood.      Viserys laughed nervously. Daemon wouldn’t dare! Or would he? Anger bubbled within him. This wasn’t one of the maidens that the madame of a whorehouse reserved for his brother! Her father was one of the men on the King’s Small Council. His own Queen wife had once looked upon this girl as a daughter.      “You dishonor my ward like this?” The King spat out. “This is all a jest to you Daemon but you are lucky there is no audience because if there were one I’d have your tongue for what you’re suggesting.” He threatened.      “I am making no suggestion brother. It is but the truth. I have claimed her. Her maidenblood is spilled now she is mine and you will give her to me to take to wife.” Daemon said calmly. He didn’t want to be too demanding.      “And was she receptive to your advances?” Viserys asked sarcastically. He didn’t believe a word out of Daemon’s mouth but a growing fear in the pit of his stomach told him otherwise.      “I made her willing” Daemon said quietly. He couldn’t risk marring the reputation of his future wife and by extension his children by proclaiming her a wanton whore. But he couldn’t very well claim he had forced her into it not with her whole family at court who would forever detest the Prince. Not to mention the rapers he had gilded with the city watch.     “If she hears of your cruel jest- I don’t doubt she will swoon.” Viserys shook his head still unbelieving. Daemon crumpled up his trophy into a ball again and tucked it under his arm.      “For safekeeping. Quite a souvenir.” Daemon said and chuckled.      “Have Lady Y/N brought before me” Viserys ordered one of the guards that lingered by the door. That man was pink faced and nervously looking at his feet and jumped upon being addressed. In his good mood Daemon laughed out loud.      “I’d rather you didn’t brother. Leave her be and consent that she be my bride.” Daemon said.      “And why should she not be here to listen to your slander? Smearing pigs blood to claim she is maiden no longer? I’d like to give Y/N a chance to speak on her behalf.” Viserys said he held up his finger.      “She’s still abed” Daemon lied easily. In truth he had found his woman curled into his side this morning. He woke to her gentle touch and shy questions as she asked if it wouldn’t be too indulgent to receive such a pleasure in the light of the day. He’d done a good job and left her so thoroughly ravaged she could scarcely remember her name. She was probably in Rhaenyra’s chambers now hunched over tapestries and recounting stories of her passionate night while the girls around them burst into giggles. The picture of it brought a smile to Daemon’s face.      “You mean this Daemon?” Viserys asked finally believing the Prince. He needed to contain this incident before it grew and took legs. “Will this make you happy brother?”      “More than anything.”      “Have Ser Lyonel Strong brought in” he ordered the guard. “And ser Harwin if he is within the walls.”      The men appeared quickly and looked apprehensively at Daemon. Ser Harwin of the city watch was more at ease than his father.      “‘My brother is a Targaryen Prince won the crown at the Stepstones and is a bachelor after the demise of this Lady wife the seven rest her soul.” Viserys announced to them. “He is every maiden’s dream or so they tell me.”      “I am not unaware that it is my perjury that decides the hand of your daughter Lady Y/N Strong. Therefore I have found a suitable match my own brother Prince Daemon Targaryen. Only the finest for her to honor her late mother’s Targaryen heritage.” Viserys gestured to his brother standing to the side unbothered with bedhair in his undershirt in the midafternoon. Ser Lyonel’s face paled.      “I cannot go forth with this wedding without doing you the courtesy of letting you be the first to know that your second daughter Lady Y/N Strong will wed my brother the Prince. Is there any reason you might object?” Viserys asked hoping they might offer a valid reason. But silence prevailed.      “She is of course most willing.” Daemon taunted. He couldn’t resist the temptation any more than he could resist your allure.      “We are honored your Grace.” Lyonel spoke uneasily after a while. Ser Harwin didn’t look too convinced either but there was no way to voice their fears without insulting the King’s own brother. They refused to look at disheveled Daemon smirking at them.      Daemon whistled a happy tune as he waltzed around the hallways and to his chambers.      He sighed in relief at the ease at which he received the Crown’s approval. Now all there was left to do was convincing you that a life with him held more promise than one as Rhaenyra’s ladies in waiting.,2024-07-10 09:33:03 GMT

I have not.” Lindon took Alicent’s hand and raised it to his lips enjoying the way her cheeks reddened. “I appreciate you coming to me your Grace and I enjoy your company. However what is unfolding here in no way relates to Dorne.”   “I understand.” Alicent sighed heavily looking as though the weight of the world rested upon her shoulders. “Perhaps I shall see you for dinner one night soon?

It means a lot to have such a support. Thank you!   You walk towards his chamber at a quick pace. You just wanted to check on him. The pressure he was under these days took the most of him and you noticed the circles around his eyes getting darker. Today there was no exception. A long day for your dear uncle.  You didn’t wait to knock you didn’t wait for the guards to open the doors for you. You just walked in. You saw him by the window his hand holding the bridge of his nose. “What now!?” He snapped.  You rised your eyebrows at him walking further into his room. “It’s just me.” His lilac eyes met yours for a second as he let out a tired breath. “Wanted to check on you.” His eyes were tired. His hair is a mess. He turns away to a balcony with a frustrated sigh.  “I don’t need checking.” There he was always pushing you away. When the two of you were kids you couldn’t even spend a day without each other. Always together always in trouble. As you grew older as your mothers got into a even bigger mess you grew apart a little. “Don’t care. Still wanted to check on you.”  You walk over to him and slide your hands on his back to his shoulders and start to put pressure. Simple massage. Aegon’s shoulders were tense and stiff he wanted to push your hands away but instead of doing that his head drops a small groan escaped his lips as he felt the pressure in his shoulders release slowly. “And I told you I’m fine” he grunts though doesn’t stop you from massaging his shoulders.  A smirk tugs on your lips. “You didn’t. Even if you did I don’t believe you. Come sit uncle. Relax.” You softly push him towards a chair next to a fireplace. You knew him. From the outside he was cold but from the inside.. He was touch starved man. He wanted someone to understand him.  His eyes turn to you as you speak he was about to protest and tell you that he didn’t need to be told what to do but when your hands pushed his shoulder he decided against it and sat down.  “Are you happy now?” He asked as his head leaned back so that he could look at you a scowl on his handsome face. You puff and shake your head your hands swiftly finding his shoulders again. Your fingers soon found his scalp and started to massage it.  His eyes remained on your face as you massaged him and played with his hair his eyelids started to grow heavy because of your fingers. He closed his eyes groaning a little when your fingers tugged through his locks.  The sound of annoyance left his mouth but he secretly loved it when you played with his hair it was one of his guilty pleasure.  ”Stop that.” He mumbled his body growing more relaxed under your touch. You knew he didn’t want you to stop by the goosebumps that went through him as you start to go to his neck. “You want me to stop Aegon?”  “Yes.” A lie. He knew he was lying. He wanted you to keep going. To keep your soft hands ob his body. To touch every inch of him. You were his escape. His ticket out. And the thing is he didn’t want to loose you by doing something stupid. He didn’t want you to see that his pants are becoming more tight on him. That he is holding back from pulling you onto him to touch your body.   “Make me stop then.” His jaw clenched as you continued to touch him and he finally opened his eyes only to look up at you again.  “I’m warning you.” He breathed a small shiver run through his body clearly enjoying your touch. Your fingers traced down his neck to his chest passing the half opened shirt on him. “Or what?”  His breathing grew heavier and you could see his chest move with every breath. He swallowed trying to come up with a good response but failing to do so because all he wanted was to feel your hands on him.  “I’ll-“ he began his voice huskier than usual. He cleared his throat trying to sound confident but the way your nails glided down to his chest and over the fabric of his shirt made him feel a lot of things at once.  ”Kesā gaomagon skoros?“ You’ll what? You taunt him. You knew his Valyrian wasn’t the best but you loved to tease him like this. You saw how his bulge started to show and soon as you sat on his lap each leg by his side you felt it.  He knows you’re doing it on purpose. He knows what a little tease you are. His eyes shot up to yours as he groans. He’s frustrated. He wanted to have you all to himself. You were only his to have. No other man deserves your attention like he does. Like he craves. He slides his hands onto your legs feeling the softness. He reaches your waist and rests them there. &quot;Niece.”  He was warning you. He felt like he was going to give in his pleasures any moment. He couldn’t. You were the only thing he wanted to have right. You were his only treasure. His future in this damn life he didn’t want but for you he would live it.  “Gaomā daor jaelagon nyke naejot keligon. Skoro syt naejot indigon nyke qrīdrughagon?” You don’t want me to stop. Why pushing me away? You get even more comfortable on his lap by pulling your hips against his. His length rubbing against you as you do so.  That’s where he shot up pulled you closer to him grabbing your chin between his fingers and pulling you down onto him your faces just inches away.  He was raging inside. He wanted to take you here and now for acting like such a brat. “Fuck speak to me so I can understand you.” A gasp left your lips as you are surprised by his action. “I wish to take you how I wish. But I can’t. I don’t want to. I wish to wait. I wish to have you the right way. You and me with a ring on each of our hands. I will wait until I am yours and you are mine.”  All you wanted was to take some pressure off but you couldn’t. All the pressure all the weight will lift off his shoulders in a moment when ring slips on your finger. And that’s the moment you’re both waiting to happen.,2024-07-10 10:13:23 GMT

That not everyone recieves empathy in the same way. There are many reasons to as why Alicent walked away 1. Maybe she was worried she would only make things worse. 2. maybe she thought he preferred to be left alone.  We can see very clearly the emotions of pain on her face. She wants to help but doesn’t know how she’s not really close with her children. So she doesn’t know if her providing him comfort by hugging/her presence in the room with him would make things better or worse. E.g myself- I love my friends and family dearly but sometimes when I’m grieving I need to be left alone and someone coming to talk/hug/be with me regardless if their intention is to help will honestly make things worse than better.   There is no one way to show empathy nor one way to receive empathy. I don’t think it’s fair for people to say this about Alicent when we don’t know at all if it would’ve helped. In my opinion it’s a very black and white view of something that is an extremely complex thing.   Grief isn’t the same for everyone. Comfort from others isn’t always the answer to grief. Grief can be shown in many forms.   It reminds me of how Helaena got a lot of hate after the b&amp;c scene and people saying she had no empathy/care for her children due to her reaction. Not everyone reacts the same to these things. If you would kick and scream that’s valid but people like Helaena who would dissociate from shock and trauma are valid as well.   We’re all completely different individuals billions of us. We all experience things and show things different. Just because we may experience things differently doesn’t mean we are lacking of empathy.   In my opinion the only people who fail to have empathy are the ones who cannot comprehend this.,2024-07-10 11:52:55 GMT

Funny thing is the things that most people complain about are the most insignificant details that don’t really have an overall impact.  “Why does Hugh Hammer have a family?” - Because they want him to have some sort of background and develop him more than the book did. “Why did they cut Nettles?” - Because her character doesn’t make sense in the show. “Why are Dany’s eggs not from Dreamfyre?” - Because that was only lightly implied in the book and even then it’s just a silly Easter Egg for GOT fans.

The stakes are getting higher. Plus the start of the crossovers Victoria and I have planned with the Jump then Fall series.   Description: In which the Blackwood Knight bends the knee before his Queen.  Part 1 Part 2 Part 3  Playlist:  One Thing~ One Direction  Risk~ Gracie Abrams  Only Girl (in the world)~ Rihanna  I think he knows~ Taylor Swift  A silver moon shone through the casement of the turret window of Raventree Castle Benjicot leaned against staring out across the expanse of Blackwood vale towards the borders of Bracken lands. His arm raised above his head leaning against the wall soft candle light cast shadows over his disconsolate expression. Never had he wished to cross such an expanse before so long had he been the arbiter of the very border which he now wished to dissolve. Raised as he was to inherit the Blackwood estate and lands he was equally set to inherit the duty to further propagate the ancient enmity between the Blackwoods and the Brackens. A duty he had never railed against until now.   His thoughts turned to the lady whose beauty of mind and form had made him question all that had once seemed to him so certain. The very lady who he who he was determined to make his lady wife. He could not very well ask her to leave her whole life her family her House to be at his side. He would not ask her to. Instead he resolved he would dissolve the very borders between them.   An amused voice broke his reverie.  “Oh look it’s our resident troubadour musing over his lady love.” Benjicot’s friend Robb laughed at him elbowing him in the ribs.  Turning to him with a bemused expression Benjicot responded “And what if I am?”  Rob laughed again turning to lean jauntily against the castle walls.  “I thought you were a man of action. Why don’t you just march down there bend the knee and offer yourself in marriage to her. You bore me enough with your plans to do just that thing? Do you think she will refuse? I would if I were her.”  Benjicot pushed his friend in the shoulder but his expression betrayed a hint of insecurity behind the action.  “That is definitely a concern. She is very shy and I cannot be sure that my love will be returned. There is also the small matter of our warring Houses. I would not merely be asking her to accept me but also my House…and to forsake her own. I will not ask her to make such a sacrifice. I must instead find a way for both our Houses to resolve their differences. If my world will not accommodate her I must tear it down and begin anew.”      &lt;!-- more --&gt; Robb met Benjicot’s gaze with his own incredulous one.  “Trying to get the Blackwoods and the Brackens to resolve anything without the use of extreme force is beyond belief. Just the other day I encountered that Bracken fellow you like to refer to as a peacock attempting to move the boundary stones further into our lands and I had to restrain myself from making him eat the damn rocks.”   Benjicot’s eyes darkened slightly “that fellow is incorrigible but he is also I’m afraid the cousin of my lady so I can’t very well dispatch him…though I have thought of doing so…many times.” He looked off into the distance with an almost wistful expression.   “I would not direct my proffers of peace terms to such an idiot. The future Lord of Bracken Hall Aeron Bracken could be more reasonable. He does not wish for further bloodshed and may be amenable to a settlement. A dispute at the border with his own lady has convinced me of this.”     A mist had swept over the Riverlands overnight coating the grass expanse with dew drops as Y/N walked towards the Brackentree struggling to contain her excitement at seeing her knight. Her thoughts continued to turn on the events of the previous day when he had spun her close to him and had gazed at her with a look that held something behind it that almost convinced her that he harboured the same feelings that she did for him towards herself. Almost for she had convinced herself in the intervening hours after he had walked her back to the outermost borders of the Brackenwoods that he thought of her as just a silly girl with fantasies of chivalry that he entertained only to be kind. This didn’t seem right either considering his behaviour towards her. His actions had sometimes made her hope that the opposite might be the case that he might grow to love her as she did him.    Each day that they met to walk along the border of Blackwood and Bracken lands he would bring her a book or a piece of art he believed might interest her especially as it related to great female Targaryens like Visenya. He would hold her arm over his so gently as he guided her across rockier terrain sometimes lifting her across it by the waist after first asking. If it was colder he would unclasp his crimson cloak from his own shoulders to wrap it around her own smiling at her as he did so before making a comment about how well the colour looked on her. So often did he make comments of a similar ilk that she sometimes pretended that it was because he wanted her to bear the colours of his House as his lady. But she quickly dismissed such thoughts embarrassed at even entertaining them.    At Bracken Hall she was a shadow unnoticed unimportant and frequently mocked by her cousin for her interests. Benjicot in the way that he would meet her gaze directly as she spoke nodding and smiling attentively as she did so made her feel as if what she had to say was of value and his frequent offers to ‘dispatch your cousin’ whilst only jests that made her laugh made her feel that he truly cared. All this aside Benjicot was a true knight and she knew from his behaviour towards a lady from a house loyal to the Brackens who had encountered some hostile Blackwoods that he acted with chivalry towards all ladies. Perhaps his actions were just that perfunctory even if they were kind.   With these confused thoughts turning in her mind she hardly noticed that she had already arrived at their meeting point before she bumped into a hard obstacle. Crying out in surprise and struggling to keep her footing she felt an arm wrap around her waist and another around her shoulders as she looked up into the warm brown eyes of Benjicot who smiled down at her in a mixture of amusement and something softer she couldn’t quite identify.   “Nice of you to drop in my lady although I had thought I’d have to do something truly heroic to get you to fall into my arms.” Lifting her back to her feet he moved his arms to hold onto her elbows to steady her holding on for a few moments longer than was strictly necessary.  “My apologies” she said quickly “I was distracted.”   Noticing the pink on her cheeks and her slightly panicked expression Benjicot feared he had overstepped the line and embarrassed her quickly stepping back to give her more space. When her expression didn’t change he added in a jesting tone what he meant earnestly.  “No need to apologise my lady. Feel free to fall into my arms anytime you so wish that’s what they’re there for. And of course for spearing your cousin on the end of my sword.” He added with a wink.  Smiling at him indulgently and pushing his chest playfully Y/N laughed as Benjicot rocked back on his boots as if her light touch had actually succeeded in moving him.   Pushing him again for this jest Benji placed his hand above hers on his chest arresting it in its place. Smiling down at her he held her hand in place like that for a few seconds before moving it so that he could graze it with his lips. Gently dropping her hand back to her side he nonetheless retained hold of it as he turned to direct them to their usual walking route through the borders of the Brackenwoods.   After a few moments of walking in contented silence Benjicot began “This knight has a proposition to put before his queen if she be so pleased to entertain it?”   Turning with a laugh to swat at him Y’N responded “you jest!”  Catching her hand in his once again Benjicot stopped them in their passage looking into her eyes earnestly “Do I?”  “You know you do” she scoffed moving to continued walking before Benji once again stopped her by taking a gentle hold of her elbow.  “I am sorry to hear you say so. I have begun badly already. I’m afraid you will have trouble listening to the whole of what I will say.”  Seeing that he looked genuinely troubled she stopped to gaze back up at him.  “I’m sorry continue.”  “Well” he hesitated taking a step towards her to close the distance between them “I would like to ask you a question if you would permit it.”   Seeing her nod in acquiescence he took a deep breath more on edge than she had seen him since he had rescued her from his bannermen before taking her hands in his and bending low head lowered before her.  “What are you playing at again Benji” she said half in amusement and half in confusion.  Smirking at her shortened version of his name hers alone to use he drew strength from the feeling of her smaller hands in hands.  “I once offered you my service as a knight in your protection. I meant it when I bent the knee before you that day and I mean it now as I offer myself to you as your husband and protector. I would dedicate myself to your happiness and ensure that your days and nights were safe. I would have you be my lady wife and the future Lady of Raventree if you would have me.”   Fearing to look up at her and gage her reaction Benjicott kept his head lowered awaiting her response as the agonising silence continued.   To his surprise she harshly withdrew her hands and began to walk away from him without a word. Momentarily stunned Benjicot looked after her retreating figure before rallying himself hurrying to catch up with her.  “My Lady” he called to no answer. Repeating his call she turned with a stricken look that made his heart drop into his stomach seeing that tears were forming behind her eyes. Berating himself in his mind for upsetting her he frantically replayed his words in his mind trying to find the source of his blunder to correct it. Unless of course it was him himself that offended her so. A painful thought but one he would try to accept if it was the case.  “What is the cause of your distress are you hurt? Have I said something to offend you?” He hurriedly stumbled out.  “You have hurt me.” Y/N responded with a hitch in her voice.  Feeling a sharp pain in his heart at this Benjicott stumbled back a pace and lowered his head.  “I am sorry for having done so please forgive me. How can I make amends” and more desperately he added “what can I do?”  Y/N lowered her head avoiding his gaze before responding in a quiet voice he had to lean towards to hear “don’t make fun of me.”   Raising her voice slightly she continued each word a lance to his heart.  “I have endured enough mockery from cousin and his friends about my interest in knights and queens. I had thought that you at least would not do the same thing. I had thought that…that we were friends that you respected me enough not to do that.”  As she had been speaking Benjicot’s expression had become increasingly distressed and then finally determined as he realised his blunder and the source of her pain. She did not believe him.  As she hurriedly turned to leave Benjicot grabbed her hand.  Turning in frustration attempting to wrench her hand from his firm hold Y’N demanded he let her go.  Benjicot stepped towards her wrapping his arm around her waist closing the distance between them  “I will once you listen to me…please.” He added as she stopped struggling.  He raised his free hand to gently graze her cheekbone with the back of his knuckle before tucking a strand of her hair behind her ear.   “I earnestly apologise for having acted in a manner which caused you to disbelieve the truth of what I have said but please believe me when I say that I have never and would never mock you. Especially for something I myself most ardently believe to be true: that I am your loyal knight and protector whether you will have me or not and would be your husband if you would allow it.”   Recognising in Y/N’s direct gaze a desire to search for the truth of his claims in his eyes he lowered his head towards her so that she could look into his eyes more easily.   A few more agonising minutes passed for Benjicot before his lady’s gaze seemed to soften and she said in a soft questioning voice.  “You are in earnest?”  “I have never been more so about anything in my life.”  “And you want me?”  Chuckling at this he stroked her cheek again “No I mistook you for your peacock of a cousin obviously.”  Laughing at this she raised her own hand to wrap it around the back of his neck causing butterflies to rise in his torso.  “Then I will be your lady.”  Breaking out into a smile which conveyed love and admiration Benji lowered his face towards her slowly stopping intermittently to check for any sign of distress in the expression of his lady.  Hovering his lips above hers in hesitation gazing into her eyes with a look that asked for her permission he moved his hand to hold her head as he gently grazed his lips over hers deepening the kiss when her arm wrapping around his neck made him sure that his lady was in fact his to love and adore as well as serve and protect.   Breaking the kiss he continued to hold her head in his hand gazing down at her with a reverential look that could only be for a knight towards his queen.  Her expression suddenly becoming distressed as she pushed him away Benjicot briefly panicked that he had after all been too forward until she told him her fears.  “But how will I become your lady if I belong to House Bracken.”  Smiling in relief that he had not been the cause of her distress he once again took her hand in his raising it to his lips before he assured her:  “Don’t distress yourself on that account. I will find a way for you to be both Lady Blackwood and Queen of the Bracken lands. I’ll burn the borders down myself if I have to although I am very fond of my boundary stones. Perhaps I will have to take my good friend Robb up on his idea for them.” He returned a glint in his eye.  “And what is that?” she asked with a slight tone of disapproval anticipating an answer very much along the lines of the one Benjicot would give.  “Oh nothing to be concerned about my sweet just feeding the stones to a particularly troublesome peacock.”  We love desperate and pathetic men on this blog.   @lovebabe18 @poppyflower-22 @ithilwen-blackwood @spinachtz @lady-callisto @twistytimesandthoughts @abookloverlawyerfan-blog @mymoonempress,2024-07-10 13:47:35 GMT

This bitch who has really nothing no inheritance no title (beside the ones about missing eye and killing kids) who only ever flaunted being a Targaryen just fucking killed ANOTHER DRAGON (not even mentioning him nearly offing Sunfyre too) and this time not on accident and he is fucking HAPPY AND SMUG. And since Aegon is out of commision I would not be surprised if it was him green-lighting the shitshow of a parade in the next episode.   Like yes you’re allowed to be relieved about defeating an enemy. You don’t have to mourn Rhaenys we all been knew you don’t care about your family. You don’t even have to mourn Meleys but for fucks sake show atleast some remorse you FUCKIN PRETENDER A DRAGON JUST DIED! That is a piece of your family’s history.

31,House of the Dragon,['aemond targaryen'  'aegon ii targaryen'  'aegon targaryen'  'team green'  'hotd'  '*'],maryqos,I absolutely love the way the ~drama~ between aegon and aemond played out last episode. I think it highlights such a key part of fire &amp; blood which is how history is manipulated. what may have looked to us like aemond so explicitly targeting his brother could also be interpreted differently depending on something so slight as the angle of the camera. as the audience we’re led to believe that aemond saw an opportunity to enact vengeance on his brother and he took it. but what if from a different point of view he saw that as the easiest way to save his brother?? maybe aemond knew that aegon would never emerge from this unscathed (which is itself indicated by the way he mumbled ‘idiot’ before leading vhagar up to the sky) and instead decided to get him out of the mess early in the battle in order to spare him from being murdered by meleys. (and it’s just a plus that he got to char his brother a bit).   aemond may be impulsive but he’s also immensely calculated. he saved his brother in the long run but he also took the opportunity to make him suffer.   this is all theory obviously and it could be completely wrong but I think it highlights just how up to interpretation every event of the show is.,2024-07-10 14:30:08 GMT

But after he got crowned he enjoyed the love and want to be a king but he is unprepared because of years of his act of not caring of his own neglecting behavior and he is self aware of it.

Answer: A dragonrider doesn’t need to know Valyrian to control their dragon. Targaryens using High Valyrian to command their dragon is mostly just…someone training their French bulldog with French commands to keep it “authentic.”  &lt;!-- more --&gt; In the book there are many dragonriders who don’t know a lick of Valyrian who can control their dragon no problem. Even the popularized “dracarys” seems to be a Dany invention and not necessarily an established command amongst all dragonriders:  “Your Grace. I am sorry to disturb your sleep.”    “I was not sleeping ser. Come and watch.”   …   “Drogon” Dany said softly “dracarys.”    And she tossed the pork in the air. Drogon moved quicker than a striking cobra. Flame roared from his mouth orange and scarlet and black searing the meat before it began to fall.   …   “So I see. Dracarys?”    All three dragons turned their heads at the sound of that word and Viserion let loose with a blast of pale gold flame that made Ser Jorah take a hasty step backward.    Dany giggled. “Be careful with that word ser or they’re like to singe your beard off. It means ‘dragonfire’ in High Valyrian. I wanted to choose a command that no one was like to utter by chance.”   - A Storm of Swords Chapter 8,2024-07-10 16:14:20 GMT

Jacaerys Masterlist  Dark wings dark words you had often heard growing up in the great frosty planes of the North. Ravens often brought the grimmest of news and the most recent one had been no exception. Prince Lucerys was dead slain along with his dragon in the skies above Storm’s End and now all that was left to mourn was the memory of a young boy heir to the largest fleet in the realm.  The distress on Prince Jacaerys’ face at hearing the words from your mouth had stung your heart even though you had only known him a week.   As his winged beast had landed in the courtyard of Winterfell and the wind-swept prince had dismounted eager to negotiate with the Warden of the North and ensure the oath made to his mother would be honored you had been intrigued. He was properly educated and possessed a seemingly gentle but fierce nature.   As the youngest sister to Lord Cregan Stark you felt honored that your brother allowed you to serve in his place and accompany the young prince to the Wall giving you the opportunity to tell him of the history of the honorable House Stark.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Arra was pregnant nearing her labors and Cregan did not wish to be parted from her as they awaited the impending birth of their first child.  The dark wings carrying the news had come to you on the Wall and now the small party you had gathered could only journey back to Winterfell Prince Jacaerys carrying the grim news with him as you returned to his dragon housed safely within the ancient fortress.   On the second night of your return south a storm was brewing on the horizon as night was falling quite early enough in the day for your men to want to push forward but as the winds picked up and the air turned icy all agreed that a few hours at an inn would be more prudent.   The horses alone needed the rest and you suspected the prince would soon fall from exhaustion as he had refused to sleep since learning of the tragedy.  A small slightly decrepit inn along the road was all your party could find but at least the walls were made of stone and the chimneys were smoking—you negotiated a stay for your party of a few men and one royal prince and as you rode back to the horses waiting further up on the beat-up path you instantly noticed the one saddle was empty.  “Where is the prince?” you asked noticing how your squire was holding the reins to the prince’s riderless horse.  “Gone to the forest said he needed a moment to gather his thoughts” one of the men replied from atop his own mare.  His back to the path deep under the cover of pines and frost Jace had found refuge from his grief in sudden rage—he had taken out his sword against a great tree trunk welcoming the burn in his arm stroke after stroke as he attacked the bark as though it was an enemy he wished to strike down.   The loss of Lucerys was as a limb had been ripped from his body his heart ripped from his chest by the cold hand of the Stranger leaving him gasping for breath and nauseous.  Lost as he was to his great sobs and shudders he did not hear as you approached and you hesitated.  The first words that came to your mind were that he would dull his blade but you realized grief took over reason and that a blade could always be sharpened—a fallen brother could never be recovered.   You stayed at a distance keeping watch as the prince cried out with each stroke against the tree great cries that chilled your blood as much as they broke your heart. It was always a tragedy to learn of a young man’s passing and a war of kin against kin was all the more terrible.   The wind picked up and the smell of impending snow fell over you and you rushed to warn him.  “My prince” you called and Jace was startled out of his trance.   Shame curled in his stomach as he sheathed his blade hesitant to turn around and face you. You were always so composed similar in composure to your elder brother if only warmer.   He had lost his temper in front of a noble person he had come to admire a lady no less allowing his grief to cloud his mind and have him behave in a way that was neither dignified nor admirable.  “The storm is picking up” you informed him. “We have found an inn down the hill we should take shelter now and resume when it has passed. It is but a summer storm it should clear upon morning.”  “Of course my lady” Jace replied turning to walk back to the traveling party but not meeting your eyes. You could tell his face was flushed behind the curtain of thick dark curls. “My apologies. I lost my temper.”  “I know what it is to lose a brother. You needn’t conceal your grief” you offered bumping your shoulder with his but you could instantly tell it had been the wrong moment to offer comfort.   “Yes I do need to” he snapped and you nodded in deference slowing down your pace and allowing him to lead the way.    “I’m afraid the inn is quite full tonight my prince many travelers have found themselves caught by the storm” you explained as you led him from the main hall of the inn to the narrow corridor upstairs. You turned the key in the rusty lock and pushed the door open. “It is not much but it will keep you warm.”  The room was small with a narrow bed a chair a fireplace and a small table where a basing of steaming water had been placed. Upon the bed additional furs and pelts were waiting and the comfort was a welcome one.   Jacaerys felt sorry that such efforts had been made for him as the rest of the men would have to sleep with their horses or forgo rest altogether keeping warm in the dining hall instead.  “Lady Stark” he called after taking stock of the room turning to look upon you standing near the door.  “My lady is sufficient” you replied graciously. “That title belongs to my brother’s wife Gods bless her labors.”  Jacaerys nodded endeared at your obvious love for your good-sister and the way you never missed an opportunity to call upon your Gods for blessings and curses alike.   “I spoke harshly to you when you were only trying to show me kindness” he offered as a premise to an apology but you dismissed him with your usual kindness.  “It wasn’t my place” you replied and it only made him feel all the more guilty—you had shown him graciousness and he had repaid you with enough harshness that you felt your kindness hadn’t been appropriate.  “No I appreciate it. Family is important to you” he replied somewhat clumsily. “You have lost a brother” he prompted eager to start the conversation again to a place where you could perhaps both find common ground.   “Little Rickon. Didn’t see long past his infancy” you replied with a sad smile and Jace could only picture his own siblings Aegon and Viserys white-haired babes that he adored beyond measure.   “Luke was slain by our kin no less our uncle” Jacaerys swallowed his fury. “I find myself wanting revenge but how can I achieve that without becoming a kinslayer myself?”  “Mine own uncle took over as Warden when our father passed while Cregan was a boy but refused to step down when Cregan became of age” you offered. “It cost him to punish our uncle but it was necessary.”  Jacaerys nodded solemnly. “I am so terribly sorry my prince for this cruel loss” you said taking a step forward and Jace accepted the closeness early.   He felt cold and not only in his bones but his soul as well. You were kind gracious and much too warm for a woman raised in such arid lands with such gruff men but it suited you. He found strength in you that he wished he possessed a resilience built and honed through trials and he realized now he was as newborn fawn next to you.    “It struck me harder than anything before. I shouldn’t have allowed it to reign over me in this way” he said regretfully and once again you met him with steadfast kindness without coddling him.  “It shows that you have a loving heart. And you chose to take it out on a tree rather than the men” you added and he frowned despite the smile that graced his face.  “I wouldn’t have dared. They are your men” he remarked.  “And yours as well as you speak for their queen” you said and he contemplated you in silence both stunned and honored by your words. “I shall leave you you are surely chilled to the bone” you then added patting him on the shoulder before making your way to the door.  “Where will you rest?” Jacaerys asked.  “With the men their company is quite merry” you assured him hand on the doorknob.  To your surprise and your delight he pressed the issue. “They gave me hot water perhaps you might need it more than I do…”  “You need not worry about me. Us northerners are not as delicate” you remarked with a smile only for the fleeting pleasure of seeing his pale skin flush under his freckles.   “Still…” he murmured unsure where to lead the conversation.  “Unless you are wanting for company” you offered letting your hand fall from the doorknob.  “It does not do me well to be alone with my pain but it wouldn’t be appropriate” he hesitated looking down contritely.   “Depending on what sort of company you are wanting” you said with a small shrug neither dismissing nor encouraging—you allowed him to come to you in his own way at his own pace.   “I would not dare” Jace replied sweet and proper and he was ready for you to take offense although you were the one to offer company.  “I would” you replied walking to him in slow steps allowing him the grace to dismiss you but he did not. Instead his eyes darkened as your palms found purchase on his chest—his eyes bore into yours for a moment an hesitant breath leaving through his parted lips before he dipped his head.   You were surprised by the way he kissed you slow and inquiring allowing you to meet him halfway. He was careful to the point that you wondered how much experience he truly had. You wondered how far he would allow his grief to push the bounds of propriety.   You sighed as he curled a hand at your waist under the furs bringing you against him tightly. The same fire you had witnessed in the throes of his fury and grief resurfaced and soon his arm was pressing at your lower back   “The men…” he murmured suddenly bashful.   “Know their place and know better than to spread gossip” you replied. Your virtue didn’t need protection but you found the thought to be sweet. Heat curled at your core in excitement; you suspected he would be a considerate lover.  In truth he had had a few tumbles with village girls on Dragonstone but you were a lady of a great house not a common girl who could be forgotten so easily. You deserved more than a quick tumble or an unsatisfying tryst. “Perhaps you should join your men” Jace whispered after breaking the kiss.  “If it is what my prince desires” you replied disappointment curling in your stomach.  “It would be my desire to keep you with me but I’m afraid I would make a poor lover in my pitiful state” he explained shame tainting his words. You could feel a slight trembling in his body and you smiled endeared.  “You needn’t worry. If warmth and comfort is all you wish then that is all we shall share” you offered. “If you desire more then I am sure you can figure it out together.”   The spatter of freckles across the bridge of his nose blended with the flush that rose to his skin as you undressed one another slowly. Jacaerys bit back an embarrassed laugh as he struggled with the buckles of your furs and you came to his rescue—he wasn’t able to swallow a surprised noise as he pulled your linen undershirt over your head to reveal your bound breasts.   He was delicate as he removed the pins and undid the binding uncovering your chest. You breathed a relieved sigh at the sudden loss of pressure and it turned into a delighted moan as Jacaerys dipped his head flattening his tongue against your nub tracing the curve of your breast with his thumb.  You cradled his head by his mop of wild curls shivering as you felt his mouth bring it to a peak. His own chest was sensitive as you mapped it with the flat of your palms his stomach shivering in the cold of the room. Soon the room filled with the soft sounds of panting breaths as you both pressed warmth to the other’s skin.   As he gently guided you toward the bed you hesitated unsure how he would like your embrace to go but the answer to your musings came when he turned around sitting down on the edge of the bed and pulled you to him.   You climbed as he guided you both knees digging into the furs as your thighs cradled his hips.   His freckles seemed to dance in the light of the fire as he looked up at you his eyes never leaving yours as he brought you down closer by the lower back pressing you firmly against his hardening cock. He was long and slim your own arousal swelling between your legs your folds growing wetter as your nub hardened.   “Allow me?” Jace asked biting a moan as you ground down harder against him but soon his hard length was replaced with his finger tips sliding in the crease of silky skin at the apex of your thighs fumbling until he found what he was seeking.   His eyes trained on your face he learned from your reactions and your guidance until he was curling his thin fingers inside you pressing against the spot that made you curse and call out the gods’ names.   Your back arched and he stroked his own cock in counterpoint with the rocking of your hips. For a few minutes his mind was blissfully blank finally warm after days of enduring the summer snow that still chilled him to the bone.  Soon your combined rocking became more frantic and he pulled you closer kissing you again more biting than tender. “I can hardly wait” he confessed trembling as you both guided the head of his cock between your folds.   “Do not worry about spilling inside” you murmured against his lips swallowing his sweet groan. “I have a special tea.”  “I’ve never… spilled inside a woman” Jace confessed in a hiss as you bore down on him your walls parting to accommodate his length clenching around him tightly.   It incensed you and you pressed the offer as he ground up against you. “Do you want to?”  “Yes” he choked as he used his leverage to thrust up into your warmth his feet firmly planted into the floor.   You wrapped your arms around his shoulders and let the sweet drag of his cock pull you under. He was lovely with a roughness born from inexperience rather than selfishness groans spilling from his lips as he took you. His moans turned into whispered pleas every time you keened and the incessant push and pull between you soon crested.  “Should I warn you when—” he gasped and you shook your head.  “Take your pleasure as you wish… I’m not far from my own” you admitted as your fingers quickened their pace on your pearl.  The rocking of his hips grew choppy and uncoordinated and his mouth dropped open his brow furrowing. You allowed yourself to fall over the edge biting down your wails as the pressed inside you snapped and an unbearable heat pulsed making you clench around him.   “Gods yes…” Jace keened as he followed you spilling inside you and that mere fact was enough to make his head swim his core throbbing with a pleasure so sharp he could not swallow his cries.   Both of you laughed breathlessly as he tipped back laying down on the made bed as you nestled your face in his chest pale and void of any hair—your mirth died as he curled a possessive hand in your hair the other one finding the small of your back. His cock slowly softened trapped between your stomachs and it felt strangely intimate.  You had called each other’s names in the throes of pleasure but now he dreaded the moment you would pull back and he would have to set eyes on the wolf insignia you wore on your cloak and call you by your title again.   Jacaerys closed his eyes listening to your soft pleased sighs as he raked through your mane gently postponing the moment you would address him as my prince once more.

14,House of the Dragon,[],backjustforberena,I’ve seen people say that Rhaenys or just a dragon rider in general should always aim for the rider over hurting the actual dragon but like… even if you kill the rider you’ve still got a dragon after you! They’re not going to just disengage and play away peacefully and cease being a threat.  You’ve got to take down both. Killing a rider isn’t going to kill the dragon.

This story is inspired by the talented @thefutureibraheem please check the blog out and the phenomenal story ‘A Bride for an Enemy’. (936 words)  Pairing | Aemond Targaryen x Lucerya Velaryon/Strong (OC)  Summary | Two years after the birth of her first child Rhaenyra is about to give birth to her next children  Warnings: Friends to Strangers to Lovers Trope Targcest 16+ meantions of birthing not proofread English is not my first language  Velaria embōñar issi masterlist  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Chapter 1: The birth of Lucerya and Lucerys Velaryon   Two years after Rhaenyra gave birth to her son Jacaerys she was pregnant again and by the size of her tummy the maesters believe for her to be pregnant with more than one child.  It would be a lie If Rhaenyra said that she wasn’t scared. Her first birth was a painful experience in itself but the thought of giving birth to multiple children just terrified her because it reminded her of her mother’s pregnancy losses and her eventual death.  Thankfully not only was the pregnancy easy but she also had the support of her husband Laenor but also that of her lover and father of her children Ser Harwin Strong. These two men were both excited even though only one was allowed to show it. But it would be another lie to say that they both didn’t imagine all the things that they would teach the children in the near future.  Laenor somehow managed to convince not only Rhaenyra but also the King and his council that the children should be born on Driftmark since one of them would become the potential Lord of the Tides and Master of Driftmark. At the end Rhaenyra was happy to go through her pregnancy away from King’s Landing away from the Red Keep and most importantly away from the Hightowers.  It was a storm night and the sea was raging with waves as high as the Grand Sept when Rhaenyra gone into labour. The wind was hounding and the rain was pouring out of the sky as if the world was going to end tonight. The young princess felt as if she was burning alive on the inside with tears rolling down her red cheeks and her knuckles turned white from her grabbing the headboard of her bed while trying to stay conscious from all her screaming of pain.  After what felt like a lifetime just as the nautical dawn began the first baby came into the world and with its first cry in this world the storm outside suddenly stopped as if the young child controlled the sea and its powers. “It’s a girl!” came a joyous cry of one of the handmaidens that were there to help Rhaenyra through the birth.  But before the new mother could enjoy her little bundle of Joy the pain started again. Thankfully this time a lot quicker and not even 14 minutes later Rhaenyra held both her little girl and boy in her arms close to her heart after her maids cleaned both her and the children. Both of her new children shared their father’s dark brown hair and light eyes.  Rhaenyra looked with nothing but pure love at her two children and whispered to them in High Valyrian “Ñuha dōna byka zaldrīzoti. Nyke kivio ao bona nyke kessa mīsagon ao lēda ñuha olvie issare ēva mazeman ñuha mōrī jelevre.” (“My sweet little dragons. I promise you that I shall protect you with my very being until I take my last breath.”)  An overexcited Laenor came into the chamber followed by his parents Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys. “I heard it was a boy and a girl.” He was grinning from one side of his face to the other while approaching his wife and taking a seat beside her. “Mhm” Rhaenyra agreed “and what an entrance your daughter made.”  Corly looked out of the window at the now calm sea “and like a true Velaryon the sea bends to her will.” Rhaenys stud near her husband with a knowing look on her face but decided not to say anything since everything was still relatively new.  Laenor and Rhaenyra both noticed Rhaenys’s look but decided to ignore it and just enjoy the two new souls that are now under their care. “Have you two come up with a name for them?” Rhaenys finally spoke up walking closer to her son and good-daughter she could help but give a small smile while looking at her new grandchildren no matter who the father was and softly caresses their small chubby cheeks.  “For the boy we decided on the name Lucerys. For a girl I originally wanted to name her Visenya but now that I look at her I think Lucerya suits her better.” Rhaenyra explained while looking at her husband to see if he would approve of her decision. Laenor could only nod while looking at them with pride in his eyes “Yeah Lucerya is good.” “Would you both like to hold them?” Laenor turned to his parents and they couldn’t denied his question.  Corlys took Lucerys and Rhaenys took Lucerya and at this moment you could see the clear love they both held for their grandchildren. “Lucerya for sure is going to grow up to be a beautiful young maiden and Lucerys is going to be a handsome young man.” Rhaenyra and Laenor were both grateful for Rhaenys’s kind words that she clearly mend.  Corlys looked at both his grandchildren and spoke “Princess Lucerya and Prince Lucerys Velaryon welcome to Westeros.”  The News of the King’s newest grandchild spread like a wildfire over the seven kingdoms and everywhere the smallfolk celebrated their arrival using these news as an excuse to get away from their day-to-day life same as they did with the arrival of Prince Jacaerys.  In the Red Keep whatsoever one the Queen Alicent wasn’t as pleased about the news as for she found it inappropriate that the heir didn’t give birth in the Keep and she only hoped that at least these children would look like Laenor Velaryon.,2024-07-10 20:16:20 GMT

Several farewells from Rhaena’s and later Baela’s farewell and the most important Corlys’ farewell. The kiss the damn kiss I know they weren’t on the best terms but don’t tell me she left without giving Corlys a kiss knowing as Eve herself has said that Rhaenys deep down knew it was a Kamikaze mission. And of course all the drama of Corlys’ bastards. How did she find out? Since when did she know? When was it that Corlys cheated on her? because it was TWICE at least. From this I hope to see things a little clearer in the next episodes.

Despite the teasing his elder brother inflicted upon him Aemond wanted only to win his approval; and that of his father.

The tree remembers the axe regrets.  Over the moon turn since Aemond hath inserted himself upon their union not one of them has known peace. All angry or pining for another because of a misunderstanding. Because of a book because of a sword fight because of a single glance.  Even seated round the council table Aemond stares at their entwined hands. Love is a curious thing in all its different forms. Y/N is never going to love him the way she does Aegon.  “What will my children call you?”   “Aemond or uncle. Same as they always have.”  “What will your children call me?” The wound is still fresh raw and aching as Aegon presses against it.  “It will be nearly impossible to tell…whether they are yours or mine until they are grown.” Aemond admits “I suppose they might call us both father.”  Y/N buries her head in her hands sick with the guilt of what she’s done.  Dying in the name of love is noble sacrifice killing one’s self to love another is a senseless endeavor.  “Sometimes these things happen.”  ————————————————————————  “Are you not speaking to me?” Aemond asks when he manages to get Y/N alone.   “What difference does it make? My words mean little to you.”  Aemond sighs “I apologize for my lapse in judgment. I should not have said those things to Aegon.”  “Knowing what he means to me how could you be so cruel?” The princess snaps.  Aemond purses his lips “my brother made fun of me for the whole of my life. I saw an opportunity to return the favor. I am sorry for it.”  “Is that what this is to you?” Y/N whispers “is that what I am to you? Revenge against your brother at long last?”  “No” Aemond growls “you are…you know what you are to me.”  “Speak it.” Y/N insists “tell me what I am to you.”  Aemond closes the space between them taking her face between his hands. “You are my friend.”  “And that is enough for you?”   “If that is all I’m allowed.” Those who are starved will eat anything.  “Even if we were to marry it would not be fair to you. I love Aegon I will always love him. We grew up together he and I. Day and night for ten years we have been together. I enjoy your company and I should like to keep it but I am in want of a friend. I have a husband.”  To be so tragically entangled.  “It matters not if he is studied in the histories or if he holds interest in matters of the court. So long as I am studied so long as I hold interest in the court. The duties are mine the burdens are mine.”  “I only wish to help you” Aemond breathes.   “You can’t” Y/N shakes her head. “You cannot help me. You cannot come into my life and uproot it. I’ve children Aemond. Aegon’s children who need my love and affection more than anyone.   Children who grow up in the absence of love spend the rest of their lives wanting for it; no matter how much they are given. Like pouring into a bottomless cup endless and painful because it never fills. It is cracked from the time they are small and can never be fixed. I’ve seen the difference between children born of love and those born of duty. My children will know which they are.”  “Who fills your cup once he’s drained it?”  “The gods provide.” Y/N swipes at traitorous tears threatening to fall. “They always do.”  “Whores then” Aemond understands. Why the pleasure house why the wine why the constant thirst for knowledge. “I could fuck you as well as any.”  Y/N turns away from him. “It would mean something more to you and…”  “It would not mean a thing to me.”  ————————————————————————  Aemond makes his way to the silk streets tearing back curtains until he spots the silver sheen of his brother’s hair. Pressed back into a pillow as one of the brunettes works herself over his cock. It is not lost on him how much the pretty little thing resembles Aegon’s wife. “I need a word with you.”  Aegon huffs a laugh feeling the woman above him begin to pull away. “Ah ah” he chides “you stay right there. Doing the gods’ work you are.”   The woman sighs happily “thank you your grace.”  He gives her hips an affection squeeze before turning his attention back to Aemond. “What is it you need?”  “I was hoping to apologize for the way I have conducted myself.”  “All is forgiven brother.” Aegon waves a dismissive hand. “My wife is an endearing mystery it is not your fault for taking interest.”  Aemond cocks his head to the side “to what do I owe your sudden change of heart?”  “Y/N and I talked” Aegon grins. “Whichever parts of her you are stimulating do it well for me. Tell her I love her while you’re at it.”  Part 3  Series Taglist : @oh-you-mean-me @callsignwidow @iliterallyhavenoideawhattosay @cluz1babe @visenyareads @kiwibaekie,2024-07-10 22:20:51 GMT

(“Heirs of the Dragon—A Question of Succession”)  Jon was never out of sight and as he grew he looked more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. “Jon must go” she said now. (AGOT Catelyn II)  And in time the boy would take the oath as well. He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn’s own grandchildren for Winterfell. (AGOT Catelyn II)  Served as cupbearer/steward in preparation for leadership  At eight the princess was placed into service as a cupbearer…but for her own father the king. At table at tourney and at court King Viserys thereafter was seldom seen without his daughter by his side. (“Heirs of the Dragon—A Question of Succession”)  “When I was little my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held court. When he rode to Highgarden to bend his knee to Lord Tyrell he made me come. Later though he started to take Dickon and leave me at home and he no longer cared whether I sat through his audiences so long as Dickon was there. He wanted his heir at his side don’t you see? To watch and listen and learn from all he did. I’ll wager that’s why Lord Mormont requested you Jon. What else could it be? He wants to groom you for command!” (AGOT Jon VI)  Brother was king  On the appointed day Ser Criston Cole placed the steel-and-ruby crown of Aegon the Conqueror upon the brow of the eldest son of King Viserys and Queen Alicent proclaiming him Aegon of House Targaryen Second of His Name King of the Andals the Rhoynar and First Men Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. (“The Dying of the Dragons—The Blacks and the Greens”)  “Why shouldn’t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we married and the dragons are all dead!” He pointed at Robb with the blade. “There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to m’lords” he thundered. “The King in the North!” (Catelyn XI)  Marriage to uncle/potential marriage to aunt  Princess Rhaenyra had remarried taking to husband her uncle Daemon Targaryen. (“Heirs of the Dragon—A Question of Succession”)  A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice and filled the air with sweetness…. mother of dragons bride of fire … (ACOK Daenerys IV)  Bisexual allegations  Whilst Princess Rhaenyra misliked her stepmother Queen Alicent she became fond and more than fond of her good-sister Lady Laena. (“Heirs of the Dragon—A Question of Succession”)  “Satin show Her Grace to her place” said Jon. Ser Malegorn stepped forward. “I will escort Her Grace to the feast. We shall not require your…steward.” The way the man drew out the last word told Jon that he had been considering saying something else. Boy? Pet? Whore? (ADWD Jon X)  Killed in office  Sunfyre it is said did not seem at first to take any interest in the offering until Broome pricked the queen’s breast with his dagger. (“The Dying of the Dragons—Rhaenyra overthrown”)  Jon twisted from the knife just enough so it barely grazed his skin. He cut me. When he put his hand to the side of his neck blood welled between his fingers. “Why?” “For the Watch.” (ADWD Jon XIII),2024-07-10 22:15:45 GMT

Yeah buddy it’s almost as if just telling people they’ve got some great destiny without actually preparing them to be leaders is proven to be a mistake over and over again in this universe. Viserys was a shitty king and an even shittier father who did nothing to ensure the next ruler whoever it would be was set up for success.

She had been rather silent as he read a story before bed to her for the first time since she was seven. He remembered how she used to ask relentless questions about what would happen to the characters in the books always eager to spoil the ending.   He tries to be as quiet as possible as he crosses to the door. He hopes a goodnight of sleep will help her after all it isn’t every day a young lady’s father introduces himself for the first time in front of half the major houses of Westeros.   “You’re rather dedicated for just simply being a Maester.”   Edric nearly jumps out of his shoes when he hears Prince Daemon’s voice in the dark hall.   “She is the Lady of Runestone. It is my duty to serve her just as I did her mother.” Edric says   “Yes Yes I know. Honor duty. Wonderful things.” Daemon says finally stepping into the light   &lt;!-- more --&gt; “May I ask what you are doing here my Prince?”   He knows why Daemon is here on the opposite end of the keep instead of back with his wife.   “I am here to see my daughter. We have things to discuss.” Daemon says   “She is asleep. Perhaps your discussion might wait until the morrow. A night of rest is good for all.” Edric says   He hopes Daemon will turn around and go crawling back to Pentos. What does he think he is doing? Coming back after all these years for Rhaella.   Daemon lets out a hum of amusement at the old Maester standing in his way. At first he didn’t recognize him but now up close he does. Edric had been the one to pull Rhaella into the world while his…lady wife Rhea had screamed.   “I will see her she can sleep after our talk.” He says brushing past Edric and into her chamber “You are dismissed Maester Edric.”   Surprisingly the old man wasn’t lying. Rhaella is indeed sleeping. Long silver hair is spread across her pillows and she’s tucked securely under covers.   He decides to leave her alone for the moment and instead inspects the different things that litter her chamber. Books of every kind line her shelf and desk. A poorly drawn dragon sits atop a stack of parchments full of different doodles. He’s surprised to see a practice sword along with what looks like a boy’s outfit for sword fighting lying on a chair.  He can’t help but feel the regret that seeps into his bones as he turns back to look at her. She is only a year older than Baela and he knows he’s already missed so much. He wonders how much of fatherhood Edric has stolen from him. Was he there for Rhaella’s first steps or perhaps that cunt Gerold was. Looking at her now he realizes he should’ve taken her with him after Rhea had died. Perhaps she’d be a dragon rider by now if he had.   He winces when the hilt of his sword bumps into a stack of books that are sitting on the edge of a table. They tumble to the ground and disrupt the trance he is under.  “Aemond?”   Rhaella’s voice fills his ears for the first time. He’s insulted but not surprised that she calls the name of Visery’s boy. According to the numerous messages from his brother the two were companions.   He’s not sure what to say when Rhaella rubs the sleep from her eyes and looks at him. He had been so confident at the feast but now his mouth is empty.   She stares at him most likely expecting him to speak first. He probably should he is the adult here after all.   “Get out.”   Well he wasn’t expecting that.   Rhaella couldn’t believe what was happening. When her eyes had cracked open and saw a head of silver shoulder-length hair she thought Aemond might’ve come for a late-night visit. She couldn’t believe that Daemon was standing there a stack of books at his feet and a curse on his lips. She tells him to leave and she gives him the look that Jacaerys gives his mother when she tells him he can’t have any more sweets before dinner.   “You’re training with a sword. Are you any good?” He asks ignoring her command.   Why did he even bother asking? He had never shown interest in her before. She knew her uncle had sent letters to Pentos about her so why was he suddenly in front of her like he cared for her?   “I’m sure you are it’s in your blood after all.” He smiles gesturing to the legendary Dark Sister who sits in the scabbard wrapped around his waist.   “Leave. I don’t want to see you right now.” She says hoping he’ll understand this time.   Daemon’s mouth quirks up into what Rhaella can only describe as an arrogant smirk.   “Sleep well daughter. I’ll see you at breakfast.”   The next day is a beautiful one. The sky looked as though it was painted blue and birds sang their sweet songs while a soft breeze flowed through the castle. Despite the inherent beauty of the day Rhaella had been missing from breakfast. Aemond took note of it immediately when his Uncle Daemon was at his father’s side and one of his cousins perhaps it was Baela he wasn’t sure was in Rhaella’s spot.   He finds her still in bed her hair like a silver tuft of fuzz among the blues she had chosen for her blankets.   “You missed breakfast. There was bacon. Aegon scarfed your portion down before I could stop him.” Aemond said placing the plate of food he had in his hands onto her table.   There isn’t an answer nor a “thank you for bringing me food Aemond” from his friend.   “Do you plan to sleep the day away? I wanted to visit my horse in the stables with you today.” Aemond said   He walked over to her and tugged the covers off her.   “You’re not even asleep!” He scoffed   Aemond looked at Rhaella’s face which she tried to hide behind an ugly-looking pillow she had attempted to embroider. He wasn’t sure what he expected initially he thought the cup of wine his father had given as a treat to her might’ve been to much for her she was rather skinny. Puffy red eyes were not at all what he thought was going to be staring back at him this morning.  “What’s wrong?” He asked sitting down at the foot of the bed  “Daemon is what’s wrong.” She shuddered   Of course it was. He was an imbecile for thinking it might’ve been something else.  “He is no longer in the castle. He said something about going for a morning flight on his dragon.” Aemond says unsure if that will make her feel better. He’s never been very good with feelings choosing to ignore his own had worked rather well for the past nine years of his life.   “I do not care. I wish he’d fly back to Pentos and never come back.” She said   “Perhaps he will. My mother said he’s never been able to stay still. Apparently he and my father always get in fights that end in Daemon’s banishment.” Aemond says   “I wish the banishment would come quicker.” Rhaella sniffed   Aemond isn’t quite sure what to do. He had wanted to run off to the stables to see the beautiful mare he was given. He was aware it was his father’s attempt to make up for his lack of a dragon. Initially he hadn’t been interested why should he have a horse instead of a dragon? But now he loved Rain and the way the wind would whip through his hair when she ran. Rhaella’s sad face however had him rethinking his plans for the day. Rain would have to wait just a bit longer.   Rhaella suddenly sits up and looks him right in the eyes.  “He came here last night. Asked about my sword skills and knocked over a stack of books. He keeps calling me daughter like I have always been near him…he pretends like we are familiar when he is nothing but a folktale to me an imaginary story Maester Edric tells before bedtime.”   Aemond feels his hands begin to sweat when fresh tears make their way down her face. He hopes he is not overstepping some unspoken boundary when he wraps his arms around her in a warm embrace. To his surprise she reciprocates and Aemond feels his shoulder dampen with hot tears.   “I wish he would just disappear.” She whispers   Laena Velaryon watches quietly as the two children embrace. She had initially come to apologize to Rhaella for Daemon’s behavior. She had told him not to visit her last night yet he slipped away while she was bidding goodnight to her own daughters. Her hands rest on her baby bump as she hears Prince Aemond ask Rhaella to eat the food he has brought her.   When Daemon told her so many years ago he had a child with the late Lady Rhea Laena had felt jealous. She had been young and only freshly married to Daemon when he had admitted it. But as the years passed and she read letters from the Maester of Runestone and eventually the king himself her mind was changed. Rhaella seemed simply wonderful and Visery’s many stories about how she entertained Rhaenrya’s children and his own were good things to her. She was surprised when Daemon had declared they were to attend the girl’s name day feast. He had never wanted to discuss her until just a few days before the big day.   “I want to meet her.”   That had been his only explanation for this hasty trip. Sometimes she swore she had no idea what was running through her husband’s mind. It was not that she wished to deprive Rhaella of a father but she had pointed out to Daemon before they left Pentos that the girl might not want to see him. He had dismissed her worries and proclaimed that she would. How foolish he was.   “Lady Laena?” A voice calls out   “Oh!” She smiles at the handmaiden who is trying to enter the room “I am in your way.”   “It is alright My Lady. Do you wish to speak to Lady Rhaella?” She asked “I can come back to dress her later.”   “No it is alright. I can see her later.” Laena says backing into the hall   Aegon is not sure what to make of the scene in front of him. He had been searching for a spot to drink where his mother would not find him. The library had seemed perfect yet it was already occupied. Aemond and Rhaella sat far too close to each other while they whispered to each other over an open book.   “What are you two doing?” He asked   “Aegon.” Aemond turns to greet his older brother   “We are trying to translate this book from high Valyrian. Rhaenrya said that is what she did when she was young it helped her become more fluent.” Rhaella explains   Aegon has never been fond of his little cousin. Maybe it was because she was boring and loved books the way Aemond did or perhaps it was just because her tits hadn’t come in yet. Either way she wasn’t very interesting in his mind.   “What’s the point in learning Valyrian if you don’t even have a dragon to command it with?” Aegon asked lazily falling into a plush chair.   He doesn’t miss the way Aemond’s brows pinch together in…annoyance? Disappointment?   “We can still converse in High Valyrian! For your information Aegon we will have dragons one day they’ll be even prettier than Sunfyre!” Rhaella declares   Aegon scoffs at her overconfidence.   “Do you plan on making one magically appear?”   “No…there are unclaimed dragons! And if any of Dreamfyre’s eggs hatch I am sure we will both be able to bond with them right Aemond?”   His little brother nods and looks at Rhaella like some lovesick puppy.   “You are both nauseating.” Aegon declares         Not entirely sure if I like this chapter. Oh well.  Aegon seems like the type to steal people’s bacon.   Next Part      Comment below to join the taglist.

34,House of the Dragon,['criston cole'  'alicent hightower'  'hotd'],stilltrails,I feel like some of the Criston Cole hate is racially motivated and gives racists a safe space to hate a person of color without repercussions. Because when Daemon is given the benefit of the doubt for terrible things he does and Criston isn’t it starts to look really strange.  Like there’s not liking a character for valid reasons then calling him an animal and a brute while refusing to do the same for white characters who do the same.   It’s kinda like how misogynists use the tide of hate directed at Alicent to be misogynistic because they know they can get away with it.   also this isn’t for all criston hate. there’s valid reasons to hate him. And i’m not talking about those valid reasons.   But if you take an issue with this post you’re probably who i’m talking about.,2024-07-10 23:51:50 GMT

23,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'a song of ice and fire'  'asoiaf'  'queen rhaenyra'  'rhaena targaryen'],fallenoftheromaempire,i keep seeing dumb fucking takes on how Rhaenyra was an hypocrite for sending away Rhaena to take care of the children just because she doesn’t have a dragon. “She should have her sitting at the small council!” “She should have given her a political role.” SHE HAS A POLITICAL ROLE!! Rhaenyra is not sending her away because she wants her to be the babysitter of her children?! She is protecting her too!! Rhaena is terribly vulnerable! She has no dragon no fighting training no political experience whatsoever If she stays she runs the risk of becoming a political pawn and being sold in to marriage to whatever lord they need the loyalty of!!   Also eggs aside i beg you pardon but haven’t we been crying about wanting more female protagonist that don’t have to give up on their softness and femininity to be strong? Rhaena is in an extremely powerful position. Like Rhaenyra said if the war goes to ruin Rhaena will be their hope for the future. Not just because she will watch over the Heirs but she herself *is* an Heir. She is the older in their group she will have more decisional power over everything that regards her and the prices. Rhaenyra is protecting *all* her assets. INCLUDING RHAENA. She isn’t sending her away to play mommy she is sending her away because she will be safer that way.,2024-07-10 23:38:51 GMT

17,House of the Dragon,['ramin djawadi'  'daemon targaryen'  'hotd spoilers'  'hotd'  'review'],thequeenwechoose,HOTD 2x04 My Thoughts Rhaenys my queen. I’m so sad. I cried through that scene. She was always one of my favourites so i feared the episode for quite some time. Her and meleys bond was quite beautiful. She was a truly skilled dragonrider. The last look meleys gave her rider was just heartbreaking. I will miss her very much.  I’m not disappointed how that scene was adapted from the book. After reading the leaks i feared for the worst. But i think it was good. The only thing i didnt like was that that big ass dragon vhagar was able to sneak up on her. Its just not believeable. It’s like as if no one would see godzilla comming for miles. And it was the same move as with luke that was disappointing.  Speaking of Aemond i really hate this guy now. I never liked him. But here he just stepped over the line. Attacking his own brother and king is so crazy he has gone full targaryen madness. And the excuse is that brothel scene i asume. He should be able to differ between brothe and king but he cant.   I feel a bit of pity for aegon. He wants to be acknowleged so badly and seeks his mothers help and all she does is telling him he should do nothing like he doesnt matter. Even cercei was a better mother.   Sunfyre is truly the most beautiful dragon And i liked the sounds he made. I reminds me of a song somethig otherworldly. His and aegons bond was shown quite nice. Sadly he got ripped to pieces very quick. The sequence were the blood was drpping down reminded me of the viserion scene in got. And his crys when he got hurt were just heartbreaking.  Daemon in the haunted mansion. Oh my god. The visions are getting more creepy by the second. Dreaming bad is one thing. But seeing your wife while you are awake is next level. I dont understand the aemond reference. But i dont think i want to. I m also not interested what the wriers are spinning with this dreams. For me they are just dreams i decided. But alys has definitly a hand in this.  I enjoy daemon alone away from rhaenyra. He is very capable of taking charge of a castle and an army it’s nice to see him in action. I just adore matt smiths acting he is so good. What i always liked about daemon from the start is that he is someone that can make you smile with his sarcastic personality. The poor tully kid was certainly overwhelmed when he suggested that he should kill his half dead grandsire. Looks like we see a lot more of daemon and caraxes in the next episode. Looking foreward to this.  Rhaenyr has finally decided to fight this war. I dont understand why it has taken her four episodes. Jace was right to scold her for seeing alicent. Lukes dead should have been enough reason for her to fight this war in the first place.   A word about the music it’s an absolute masterpiece again.

Daemon opened the door with a confused look on his face. Rhaenyra poked her head and was also confused.   “where in this godforsaken place can I find peaches?” Aegon asked.   daemon chuckled.  Once the perfect peaches were acquired - a whole case of them - Aegon rushes back to his room and finds his nephew-wife. bright blue eyes light up as he places the case on the dresser and tosses a peach at his wife.   “took you a while” he comments as he cleans the peach.   “You sent me on a peach hunt forgive me for my lateness” he takes his cloak off and sits on the edge as Lucerys takes a bite of the fruit. juice drip down his mouth and chin as he smiles at the fruit.   “happy?”   Luke nods.   “I wasn’t talking to you” Aegon says before lowering his head to bulging belly between them and softly speaks “are you happy?”   &lt;!-- more --&gt; “you know… we need a name” Luke says after some time.   “Well we don’t even know if it’s a boy or girl yet” Aegon replied.   “and? we should have names ready. I only have two moons left Egg. we need a name” he says.   “very well. we’re not naming them after the Conqueror’s. I fear those names are cursed” Aegon said as he curled up beside his wife and caressed the swelling belly.   “What about… Alyssa?”   “It honors and makes Daemon sad.”   “Jacaerys?”   “no I’m sure your brother means well but to name our child after him is too far” Aegon said.   “Well what names do you have?” Luke huffed.   Aegon straightened his posture “don’t laugh.”   “I won’t” Lucerys answers with juice dripping down his chin.   “if it’s a boy Baelon and if it’s a girl Daenys” he answers.   “Those are perfect my love” Lucerys says. After two peaches Lucerys managed to fall asleep with Aegon mumbling a lullaby in high valyrian. his valyrian was not perfect when he and Luke were first married. Daemon and rhaenyra scold him for it.   “how do you consider being a Targaryen when you can’t even speak our Mothers tongue?!”   Lucerys taught him and made him have lessons with Maester Gerardys. he thought they were redundant but when he overheard Luke and Jace having a conversation in valyrian and he couldn’t understand a single word. the next day he was up bright and early to learn. now they have their own secret conversations at council meetings when their family doesn’t show. Alicent would often side eye them because Aegon is cool as can be and Luke’s cheeks are flushed red. He now sings or more so hums lullabies and speaks to the growing babe.   🦪  Luke wakes up finding his side empty. He dresses in a dark amber dress and starts searching for his uncle-husband.   “no! no! no! that’s not the color I picked!” Aegon yells from a chamber next to theirs. Luke frowns as he enters the room seeing it is being reconstructed.   “my prince -”  “no no I said sky blue okay? it’s almost pearlescent. like Arrax! have it redone” he orders. Luke raises his eyebrows at him as a man leaves quickly with a small bow.   “What’s going on?” he asked.   Aegon smiles as his violet eyes lay on him he walks towards him and kisses his lips. “I’m having the baby room made. it’s right next door and I’m going to have them blow this wall out for a door to be made” he explained.   “a couple months too late no?”   “Well the crib is all in the hands of your grandsire Corlys. finding a dragon egg is in the hands of Daemon. I’m in charge of making sure all toys and clothing is ready” he adds.   Luke smiles as Aegon stands in front of him his hands on his hips silver hair a mess of curls “fatherhood is changing you.”   “Well I plan to not be like my father” he responded.   He steps forward and takes Aegon’s hand in his and rests them on his swelling belly. a small kick could be felt making Aegon flinch.   “How dare you?” he softly asked.   “I think he would rather sleep in our room when he’s born” Lucerys said.   “He will but he’ll need his own room” Aegon replied.   another kick.   “I think our child… hates you?” Luke teased.   “No I think he’s just too attached to his muña which I can’t blame him too much for” Aegon leans forward and kisses Lucerys with much passion before a knock on the door breaks them apart.   “The Lord Hand would like to see you both” Ser Criston announced.   🦪  pushing open the doors to the council room Aegon and Luke sit in their respective chairs. Daemon and Rhaenyra sit across from them along with the Princess Rhaenys. there’s tension in the air that Luke refuses to let destroy his good mood.   “The princess rhaenys has news from Driftmark” Otto says sitting in his chair. Viserys weakly nods for his cousin to speak.   “Lord Corlys has fallen ill after the battle of Stepstones. before he gave way to the fever he sent me one last request. That Lucerys be his regent until he comes out of it” she announced.   “As you can see princess rhaenys prince lucerys is in no condition to be sailing to rule over Driftmark. What of Vaemond Velaryon?” Otto asked.   Rhaenys did not look at the Hand just at the King “Viserys” her voice was too soft for the council’s liking “Corlys asked for this. Allow Lucerys to rule. He does not need to sail; he can fly over. You’ve had Luke stuck in this Keep learning of Driftmark. it’s time he takes his place even if it’s just as regent.”   “Lucerys?” his mother whispered.   The boy looked over at his mother meeting her violet gaze. Lucerys nibbles on his bottom lip before looking over at Aegon. His husband reaches over and holds his hand.   “If Luke goes to Driftmark he has my support and I will go with him” Aegon announced.   this causes Otto to stand “you are needed here at Kings Landings.”   “no I’m not needed here” Aegon responded looking up at his grandsire “I haven’t been in meetings unless it’s with Lucerys. Now my husband is needed at Driftmark. I will be flying with him.”   “Very well son” viserys says. it catches Aegon off guard because never had Viserys referred to him that way. Luke noticed the slight change in his facial expression and tightened his hold on his hand. “you are relieved to fly to Driftmark.”   🦪  two moons into Luke’s regent and he was doing incredible work. Driftmark now housed Meleys Sunfyre Arrax and Seasmoke. Although the sailors didn’t trust Aegon they showered and showed much love to their Pearl of Driftmark and the future babe.   “baby!” Luke yelled out of his chambers.   Aegon came in holding a mango and a peach “yes my siren?”   “Help undress me and get in the bath with me” Luke says taking the peach and biting it. He places the mango on the table nearby with herbs and scent oils before helping unlace the dress. He carefully pulls the strings and the blue dress hits the floor. He helps Luke in and he quickly strips to join. Luke grunts as he shifts uncomfortably in the water.   “What’s wrong? Is the water too hot?” Aegon asked as he rubbed his back.   “I’ve been feeling sharp pains all day. it’s annoying” he groans.   “How frequent are they?” Aegon asked his voice slightly quivering.   “oh fuck… it’s the babe isn’t it?” Luke asked as another sharp contracting hit him.   “I need to get the maester-”   “no! no you are not leaving me alone!” Luke yelled grabbing his hand.   “You need a maester!” Aegon argued.  “We can do it ourselves!” he shouts feeling pressure build between his legs.   Aegon knew deep down Lucerys feared something happening like his grandmother Aemma. he wrapped his arms around his waist pulling his back to his chest. Aegon luckily had asked maester Gerardys many questions in how to help with the labor in case a situation would arise and it would be just the two of them. now his learning would be put to the test.   “deep breaths and when you feel a contraction push” Aegon told him. as Luke did as he was told and gripped onto his husband like it was his lifeline. In a way it was. if something went wrong the decision to save his life or that of their unborn child would be in Aegon’s hand. The thought scared him but the feeling of the baby’s head pushing out broke those thoughts. in a swift move he pushed the rest of the babe’s body and held their child on his chest. no cries echoed in the room and the water in the tub turned redder. He didn’t know if he was breathing. if the babe was breathing. hell if Aegon was breathing. for a moment Luke believed they were now holding the corpse of their child. The sound of baby cries filled their room a second later.   “oh thank fucking gods!” Aegon yelled as Luke softly chuckled and ran his hands up and down the babys back. “oh shit” he comments.   “what? what? what?” Luke carefully pulls his baby into his arms to take a good scan. all ten toes and fingers. no missing limbs or deformity. a baby with green eyes and silver hair stared back at him.   “we’re gonna have to try again” Aegon says.   “why?” Luke asked.   “I want one with brown hair. I thought your genes were supposed to be strong” he says.   “Oh you big baby” Luke rolled his eyes and pressed kisses to the temple of the baby. “It’s a girl Aegon.”  “So… baby Daenys?” he asked with a grin on his lips.   “Baby Daenys Velaryon.”   Bonus Scene   Lucerys was practically laying down in the tub with his swelling belly sticking out of the milky water. Aegon had a lemon cake on his belly using his fingers to eat it and Luke did the same.   “I don’t think he likes being used as a table” Luke comments as he sucks his finger clean of the creamy foam of sugar.   “he’ll be fine. if he’s anything like his muña he will be pleased to know he’s helping us out” Aegon replied kissing the belly. Jacaerys walked in on the scene and immediately left to tell Baela he needed to have her pregnant. the quicker the better.,2024-07-11 00:45:09 GMT
30,House of the Dragon,['aemond targaryen'  'helaena targaryen'  'house of the dragon spoilers'  'hotd s2 spoilers'  'hotd critical'  'hotd thoughts'  'hotd theories'  'hotd spoilers'],ataraxiasflame,HotD Aemond/Helaena Prediction: This is only a prediction based on what we’ve seen so far in the series and the S2 trailer. As much as I hope this prediction isn’t true after the first 4 episodes of this season this feels more and more likely.  Since the show has gone the route of Aemond v Aegon and Rook’s Rest has seemingly set Aemond up as Prince Regent I fear that Aegon’s incapacitation will now bring on the ‘Maleor the Missing’ plot line.   In the Ep 5 promo trailers we see both the small council discussion of Aegon’s heirs as well as a scene with Aemond and the voice-over narrating that ‘duty is sacrifice’.   Personally I think the show deliberately erased Maelor for this purpose: Aemond now has the ‘duty’ to provide a (Green) Targaryen heir since Aegon is no longer capable (by his hand).   I expect this scene from the S2 trailer is Helaena and Aemond. Since we can assume that Aemond will now become Prince Regent the ring makes sense and the man in this scene has long hair so that really only leaves Daemon/Aemond.  It also calls back to Young Aemond declaring his willingness to perform his duty to keep their Valyrian blood pure.   But my concern is will this be consensual? I don’t trust that this show will make it consensual for Helaena at all but my expectations with Aemond now (given the route they have gone with him this season) is that he has been coveting all his brother has thinking himself the better suited brother in all ways and now he will have his wife/Queen too (making this a non-con scene).   His actions at Rook’s Rest have portrayed him as vengeful and it would make sense that he will take Aegon’s dagger his crown his throne and his Queen as his own personal war prize.   And even though the Aemond and Helaena actors claimed that their scenes were merely “subtle” the HotD actors were incredibly misleading in the S2 press tour so I do not trust that this was necessarily accurate. And it makes me think that all those tiny hints in S1 were deliberate all along. If this turns out to be true I believe they always had the intention to go this route with Aemond.  Personally I hate it. I haven’t been a fan of the changes to the TG characters but a non-con scene between the Green siblings is extreme. But this seems very much on brand for that the show has done to them. I will especially take issue with it if they make this a non-consensual scene. But I wouldn’t expect less from this show anymore.,2024-07-11 00:45:03 GMT

What have I done to deserve your cruelty? Your disregard?” Rhaenyra never raised her voice to you but now you have pushed her too far. “Why bring me news of your own deceit?” She does not plead for answers; instead she demands them. You do not quiver under her gaze as you once would have. Instead you state your case. “I will not apologize for marrying the man I love. If given the choice I would be the conqueror reborn with Helaena and your brothers at my side.”     Saera Targaryen was born with ambition. Only now does Rhaenyra believe that you have inherited your mother’s tenacious trait. “ I must admit I was misled into joining the usurpation as I believe many were.” Your breath catches in your throat when Rhaenyra’s hand tightens around yours. You continue “That is why I am here to stop a war before it begins.” Helaena grips your waist a comforting gesture.  “Will you make us prisoners your grace?” Rhaenyra seems to break at your question. Her hardened eyes scan the room before she lands on you. The throne room is empty; no one knows of your arrival. “Fly back to your usurper husband and tell him I will have my throne or I will have his head.” The realm’s delight raises her hand to dismiss the both of you but your tongue is sharp and boundless. “Good sister I fear it is the throne that shall have both your heads.”  ————————————————————  Read the first chapter of my story (inspired by my Saera Targaryen’s daughter AU) on AO3  A House of Blood and Fire - Chapter 1 - BiWitchEnergy - A Song of Ice and Fire - George R.

It sounds like the breeze through the curtains but when he opened his eyes all was quiet.  He loathed this place the damp made his bones ache and in every dark corridor he felt as if he was being watched. He could hardly sleep a full night in the cursed castle.  My love come with me…  This time when Daemon’s eyes snapped open he could see a figure at the end of his bed silhouetted against the moonlight that shone through the open window. He reached for his dagger but stopped when the figure stepped into the light and disappeared.  “Fucking hell.” Daemon cursed rubbing his eyes with his palms. Maybe the damp really was making him lose his mind. He couldn’t even trust his own eyes anymore.  He laid back down and closed his eyes again pulling the furs around his body tighter. Sleep. He told himself. Go. To. Fucking. Sleep…  You stood there watching him sleep from the foot of his bed. He was a handsome man his blonde hair was tousled against the dark furs of his bed the moon casting silver across his features.  You crept closer kneeling down on the edge of the bed your hands smoothing the sheets. You longed to touch him to feel his warmth to feel his hands upon you.  My king…  You whispered tears stinging your eyes. He would never hear you no one could hear you. You watched him stir a little his eyelashes fluttering his face frowning in his sleep.  Please I’m begging you. I don’t want to burn. Don’t let me burn…  Daemon’s eyes snapped open. He was sure he had heard something. There it was again. Crying. Someone was crying.  He needed some air this place was starting to make him paranoid. He swung his legs over the edge of the bed pulled on his breeches and a jerkin before grabbing a torch and stepping into the hall.  The castle was quiet his footsteps echoing along the empty halls. He wasn’t a fool believing in tales of ghosts and the like. But this place… he had seen things he couldn’t explain.  Maybe it was the stress of the war. Of the guilt he was trying so hard to ignore. All the lives lost because of his actions. The lives of people he loved.  A sob cut through the silence pulling Daemon back from his dark thoughts.  Don’t burn me alive…  A voice soft and pleading echoed from the end of the corridor. It had to be a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep and the damp.  Please…  There it was again. Daemon turned on his heel following the sobs until he found himself outside a small door. A woman’s voice came through the wooden frame crying sobbing pleading.  His hand went to the doorknob he was shaking terrified. What was happening to him? He had become so unmoored that he had lost his grip on reality? He knew the only way to get it back was to confront it head on.  When he pushed open the door he saw you standing in the dark corner of the room your arms wrapped around yourself as you sobbed.  For a moment he just wanted to turn around and leave. He didn’t have the capacity to console a crying woman right now. But then he couldn’t stop staring at you.  You turned looking straight at him. Daemon felt a jolt in his stomach. Your eyes they were beautiful. They seemed to glow with their own light.  “Are… Are you alright?” He asked you cautiously looking around the room for someone else. There was no one.  You wiped your tears the reason you had been crying had already slipped your mind. The moment you saw the man before you his blonde hair shining like the moon and his eyes they were so piercing like he could see right through you.  “I’m sorry I must have gotten lost.” You said taking a step towards him.  He looked you up and down his face twisted with confusion. You were dressed in finery soft silks and velvets the kind of thing a noble would wear. But this room it was bare cold and damp not fit for a mouse let alone a woman of your beauty.  “I’m afraid I must have missed your introduction.” He replied giving you a curious look.  You smiled softly it was the first time in so many years you had a visitor. He was handsome strong everything a man should be. You knew what he was a Targaryen. A dragonrider. Born with fire in his veins.  You reached your hand out and his eyes darted to it. He hesitated before taking it half expecting his hand to pass right through you but instead your fingers were warm solid.  “I’m sorry for intruding my lady. I thought this room was empty.”  Your heart was pounding the blood rushing to your ears. His touch it felt like fire power and there was an odd void to it. Like death rode beside him.  “It’s alright.” You whisper not wanting him to let go.  “Are you a ghost?” He asked his hand sliding up your arm as if testing you checking to see if you were real.  You laughed how silly “A ghost? No.”  Daemon let out a shaky breath “Thank the gods.”  “Do you want something warm to drink? It can get so cold here” You asked you wanted him to feel welcome to calm the fire in his veins.  He seemed hesitant at first but then he nodded a small smile forming on his lips.  He followed you down the dark halls keeping his torch aloft to light your way. The flames illuminating the damp cold walls and the dust that floated through the air.  “You know it wasn’t always like this.” You said softly as you walked through the narrow passageways your fingers running along the cold wet stone. “It was once a beautiful place warm welcoming.”  He glanced around at the rotting floors and the moss growing along the stonework. He couldn’t imagine it.  “My understanding is that it was always a cursed place even before Aegon’s arrival” he stated as the two of you entered the kitchens.  It was just as cold as the rest of the castle but there was a fire going and a basin full of fresh water. He lit the torches around the room and you began pulling out ingredients and preparing the tea.  Daemon leaned against the table watching you work. You didn’t look like you belonged in this place you were too clean too soft. Yet you behaved like you owned everything you touched.  “They say that before Harrenhal was built it was a vast forest of heart trees” You said focusing on putting some herbs and root vegetables into the pot over the fire “That the trees themselves were Gods and their roots are still underneath the stones waiting to reclaim what is theirs.”  “Sounds like a lot of nonsense” Daemon replied bitterly his skepticism evident.   “Yes” You agreed with a small smile “But old stories often have a grain of truth to them.”  He didn’t understand why he was so drawn to you why he sat and took the warm cup of tea that you handed him or why he asked you to sit down next to him. He wasn’t in the business of trusting people but you… it felt like he had known you his whole life.  “The witch that resides here Alys said something similar” he added remembering how she spun a tale about how this place was cursed.   Your eyes darkened and your lips set in a line.  “Do not trust her” You tell him your voice firm “She sees things that are not there and hides secrets that are not her own.”  He laughed and shook his head. “And what makes you so certain?”  You shrugged “I see things too” you replied nervously twiddling your fingers on your mug.  Daemon took a sip of his tea an amused smile on his face and his eyebrows raised “Is that so? Well what do you see about me?”  You looked at him your eyes studying every inch of his face his hair the scars along his neck. “You wish for things you don’t really want” You whisper “You seek violence but deep down you only want peace.”  Daemon’s face darkened his jaw clenched and his hands tightened around his mug.  “Peace is for the weak” He replied harshly his voice low threatening “Only the strong survive and take what they want.”  He looked so sad so lonely. You wanted to reach out and comfort him but you were scared. There was a rage in him and a desperation that seemed to engulf him.  “I didn’t mean to offend.” You apologize lowering your gaze.  You didn’t look at him your fingers running around the rim of your mug until you felt him move closer to you.  “You didn’t.” He answered you his voice softer “Tell me more about yourself. If you will.”  You looked up at him and you could see his eyes had changed softened there was a curiosity there.  “How did you end up here?” He asked you watching the fire dance in your eyes.  He could see a shadow of sadness in them pain worry. But then it disappeared hidden behind a mask of a beautiful smile. You fascinated him such a pretty flower growing amongst the cold unforgiving stone.  “My husband put me here.” You told him tracing your finger along the scarred wood of the table. “He’s gone now lost in smoke”  You could tell he didn’t know how to respond. But his expression told you that he had lost someone too. He just quietly nodded taking another sip of his tea. He was starting to relax a little more the warmth of the fire and the comforting smell of the drink was starting to put his mind at ease.  &quot;Why did you think I was a ghost?” You asked him softly your hand coming to rest on his arm as though to remind him you were real solid.   Daemon sighed rubbing a hand over his face he didn’t know how to answer that question without sounding insane. You could sense that a shadow hung around him like a stormcloud. His secrets coming to the surface.  “This place… It has a restlessness to it” he said his voice low cutting through the silence. “Some nights I lay awake listening to the walls groan as though they are shifting and moving. I can hear… I can hear…” He trailed off his voice getting hoarse.  You placed a hand on his cheek his skin was rough and warm and he leaned into your touch. You liked the way your skin felt against his you wanted to assure him that you were trustworthy.  Daemon couldn’t explain why he was telling you so much but there was a calmness to you. When you touched him it felt like Dragonstone on a summer’s day like the feeling he got when he was alone in the clouds flying far away from everything.  “Perhaps you are just lonely and the castle is lonely too” You suggest to him.  Daemon couldn’t deny the loneliness that plagued him. The nights were the worst he had no one to confide in no one to love him. He didn’t want to think of his wife his queen far away and angry with him. Or his brother dying alone and in agony. He had hurt them in ways that he could not atone for.  “Perhaps you are right” he admitted taking your hand from his cheek and intertwining it with his own.   You watched him the firelight dancing across his handsome features. His blonde hair was like liquid silver and his eyes were beautiful like a summer sky.  “Stay with me tonight” He told you his thumb rubbing the back of your hand his eyes pleading. There was a vulnerability in him one that drew you in.  Daemon couldn’t tell if he was being a fool or if he was simply desperate to not be alone. The practical part of his brain told him that a good fuck would help him sleep but this felt like something else. You were beautiful there was no denying that but you also felt like a dream a figment of his imagination.  You didn’t say a word just stood up still holding his hand and led him from the kitchen through the hall past the courtyard up the steps to his bed chambers.  The journey there felt like a blur he couldn’t take his eyes off you. The way your dress swayed the way your hair bounced the way the moonlight lit up your skin. It was like you were made of mist or smoke something that could fade away any moment.  The room was colder than when he left the air smelled stale and the curtains were flapping in the wind. It had a haunted quality like a portrait whose eyes follow you around the room.  He had left the fire burning but the warmth had been extinguished and the flames were low. You moved to light the candles giving the room a soft glow but the darkness remained.  You turned to face him he was watching you intently waiting for you to make a move. You stepped closer closing the distance between you your hands sliding up his chest. He was so warm so solid full of life and power.  His hands tangled in your hair pulling your face closer and your lips met. It was a gentle kiss hesitant almost afraid. Like he was doing it for the first time.  His mouth was warm the taste of the tea still on his lips. You could feel the desire building the fire growing inside him. You pulled away looking up at him. His eyes were dark pupils dilated a hunger in them.  “Please don’t burn me” you whispered the words sounding strange to his ears.  Daemon didn’t understand what you meant by it and his lust was too powerful to care. He captured your lips again kissing you deeply.  Your fingers found the hem of his shirt pulling it up over his head. The light of the candle flickered across his chest illuminating the texture of his scars.  “You have seen battle” You comment tracing the mark on his chest a reminder of the war and the violence he craved.  “Many times” he said his voice low heavy with desire “And I have many more to see.”  “So much suffering” You whisper leaning forward kissing one that stretched across his chest “So much blood.”  He closed his eyes letting the heat of your touch wash over him.  You moved down dropping to your knees pressing your lips against his stomach feeling the hardness of his muscles. Your hands reached for laces of his breeches untying them and freeing his cock from the confines.  He let out a shaky breath as your hand wrapped around him slowly stroking his length.  “My king” you whispered kissing the underside of his shaft.  Daemon let out a moan his head falling back his hand reaching out to grip the back of your neck. He needed more needed to feel your lips wrapped around him.  You obliged him opening your mouth taking his cock into your hot wet mouth. He groaned his hips bucking forward pushing himself deeper.  “Fuck” he hissed his fingers tangling in your hair.  He looked down at you his cock disappearing between your plump lips. The sight made him harder and he was struggling to control himself. He wanted to fuck you claim you.  Your hand reached down cupping his balls massaging them gently. Daemon moaned his grip on your hair tightening pulling your head forward forcing his cock further down your throat.  He tasted like power like a dragon made flesh. You could feel his pulse throbbing the heat of his blood the energy that pulsed through his body.  Daemon pulled you back by your hair his cock popping out of your mouth a string of saliva connecting you. He stared at you for a moment before bending down and picking you up.  He carried you to the bed dropping you onto the sheets. You looked up at him his eyes were wild and the smile on his face was pure lust.  He untied your dress pushing the fabric aside his hands sliding across your breasts. He bent down his lips wrapping around your nipple his tongue flicking over the sensitive nub.  Daemon groaned his hands moving down tugging on your skirts pulling them up around your waist leaving you completely exposed to him.  He continued kissing his way down his lips trailing across your stomach his hands lifting your thighs pushing your legs apart.  He settled between your legs kissing your inner thigh gently nipping at the tender skin. You felt his warm breath against your cunt a soft moan escaping your lips.  He chuckled pressing his face between your thighs inhaling your scent. You could feel his tongue licking the length of your pussy his fingers probing pressing inside of you.  You gasped your back arching your hands clutching the sheets. You had never felt anything like it before the feeling of his mouth and fingers moving in tandem making your whole body tingle.  “Don’t burn me don’t burn me” you whispered over and over.  He pulled away his eyes filled with concern but he did not speak did not ask you what you meant.  Instead he pressed his lips against yours his tongue sliding into your mouth. You tasted yourself on his lips and you moaned wanting more.  His eyes were gentle trying to convey a tenderness he did not have and his voice was quiet as he whispered “You are not going to burn.”  Your hands went to his chest clutching his shoulders and you let him spread your legs. He was still fully clothed but his cock was free the tip of his erection pressing against your entrance.  You gasped as he slowly pushed himself inside of you. You clung to him wrapping your arms and legs around him moaning softly as he began to thrust.  He moved slowly at first allowing you to adjust to his size but he quickly increased his pace pounding into you the sound of flesh slapping together echoing through the chamber.  “My king my king please don’t-” you moaned feeling him hit a good spot inside sending sparks through your body.  He didn’t listen didn’t understand what you meant just continued to fuck you his fingers digging into your thighs. He could feel his climax building his cock throbbing inside of you.  You could feel him getting close his breathing becoming ragged his movements becoming erratic. You fell over the edge together crying out as he released his seed deep inside you.  “My king oh my king” you moaned your nails digging into his back leaving deep red marks.  He collapsed on top of you panting heavily his head resting on your chest. He didn’t know why you kept calling him king perhaps you were a bit confused about his status. But he wasn’t going to correct you he enjoyed the way it sounded coming from your lips.  You stroked his hair his breathing slowly returning to normal. You could feel his heart beating his warmth his power.  “Don’t leave” he whispered his voice barely audible.  “I won’t” you promised him the words slipping from your lips before you could stop them.  You felt him slowly fall asleep his weight comforting on top of you.  There was a strange peace in the room the darkness and the chill receded the candlelight dancing across the stonework.  You held him running your fingers through his hair humming a tune that was as old as the castle itself.  Daemon woke to the sounds of screaming. His eyes shot open his hands grabbing for his sword that was always close by. He was alone in his bed the fire long since extinguished the only light coming from the full moon.  He didn’t have time to worry about where you had gone the sounds of people shouting and a dragon roaring had him jumping out of bed quickly dressing.  He ran down the corridor the stones were ice cold and the air smelled stale the shadows dancing menacingly along the walls. He had to push against a door it was swollen from the damp but when he burst through the smell of burnt flesh was thick.  You were in the courtyard standing in the middle your white dress glowing in the moonlight. You turned to look at him your eyes full of tears.  “Please don’t burn me” you begged him your voice breaking.  The roar of the dragon filled his ears and the sky was lit up with orange flames. He looked to the sky for the source of it had Aemond arrived with Vhagar?  He was horrified when he saw that the dragon was not Vhagar but the largest dragon he had ever seen. It looked like Balerion but it had three heads.  He watched as it descended its wings so large that with every movement the sound of the wind would change becoming deafening thunderous.  He turned to look back at you to tell you to run but you were now right in front of him. Your face was mere inches from his own burned black melted half of it hanging off.  “My king” you cried your voice a broken raspy sound. “Why did you burn me”  Daemon screamed then woke up in his bed. His body covered in a sheen of sweat his heart pounding.  The bed next to him was empty cold the fire still burning low. He could still hear the screams the dragon the pain and suffering still smell the ash and the charred flesh.  The sun was shining through the window the sound of birds singing. Everything was peaceful the castle was still silent.  He sat up his breathing slowing his pulse returning to normal. He looked around the room there was no sign of you no sign that the night had ever happened.  He ran his fingers through his hair trying to calm himself. It had just been a dream a vision. Nothing more.  But he could still smell you on the sheets and the image of you was burned into his memory. He got up dressing quickly needing to move to do something.  He spent the day meeting with vassals and lords discussing matters of the realm. Trying to keep his mind busy. He felt as though he was slowly losing his grip on reality he swore he could see you around every corner could hear your voice in every creak and groan of the castle.  The sun had set and the candles were burning low. The castle was quiet the servants had gone to bed the halls empty. He felt like he was completely alone the only one left in the vast void of this wretched place.  He made his way down to the kitchens looking for you. It was a foolish thing to do he knew but he had to find you had to see if you were real.  He found Alys sitting on a stool next to the fireplace her nose buried in a book.  “Evening” she said without looking up “Tea is in the pot.”  Daemon didn’t want tea he didn’t want anything other than to know you were alright.  “Have you seen the new girl?” He asked her trying to keep his voice even trying to seem nonchalant.  “Who?” She asked still not looking up.  “She…” Daemon tried to describe what you looked like but when he tried to picture you in his mind the only image he could see was the one from his dream your burned and melted face.  Alys watched him with a slight smirk this dragon lord was unraveling so quickly it was delicious. She went back to focusing on her book. “Doesn’t ring a bell”  He knew there was no point in trying to get more out of her so he gave up and left the kitchen.  “Perhaps she is where you left her?” Alys suggested her laughter echoing after him.  He walked back to his chambers his heart pounding his palms sweating. He stood outside the door for a moment before gathering his courage and stepping inside.  The room was dark the curtains were still closed the air cold. There was a book lying open on his bed one he did not remember leaving there.  He picked it up holding it far away from him like it could burn him. It was a book of the histories of the conquest. Of Harren the Black and his sons burning alive.  He wondered who else died in the blaze the nameless faces who were forgotten by history the servants and slaves the wives and daughters.  Daemon was sure he was losing his mind the castle was haunting him and it was only a matter of time before he became one of its ghosts.  Don’t burn me… My king…  He remembered the fear in your voice the sadness the pleading. Anger and confusion bubbled in his chest and he threw the book across the room the pages fluttering as it landed.  He needed sleep this was all because he wasn’t sleeping. Once he was rested his mind would be clearer. He put no stock in dreams or visions ghosts and monsters that was for children and fools this was all just because he was tired.  He got ready for bed blowing out the candles the moonlight casting shadows across the walls. He settled into bed and closed his eyes waiting for sleep to take him.  You watched him lay there his brow furrowed his face troubled. He tossed and turned his eyes fluttering open and closed.  You laid down next to him gently placing your hand on his cheek. He calmed at your touch his breathing slowing. You pressed a kiss to his forehead his skin warm and his hair tickled your lips.  “My king” the words fell from your lips barely above a whisper.  He opened his eyes nearly jumping out of bed when he saw you laying right next to him your head on the pillow.  “What are you doing?” He demanded his voice harsh his hand gripping the dagger under his pillow.  You sat up your hair falling around you your dress slipping off your shoulder. “I was just… I just…” You tried to find the words tried to think of what you were doing where you were. “…I missed you” you said the words not feeling quite right but they were the only ones that came.  He stared at you his eyes wild his hand gripping the dagger so tightly his knuckles were white.  “How did you get in here?” He asked his voice low dangerous.  You thought about it trying to remember but it was like there was a fog covering your mind.  “I don’t know I’ve always been here” you said your voice trembling tears starting to form. “I just wanted to see you.”  He let go of the dagger and took a deep breath.  “What is your name?” He asked his eyes studying you.  “I- I don’t know” you stammered the tears falling freely now.  He reached out and touched your face wiping away the tears with his thumb. His hand lingered his fingers brushing against your cheek.  “You’re not real are you?” He asked his voice full of sadness.  “Yes I am” you cried grabbing his hand pressing it against your cheek. “I’m right here.”  He sighed closing his eyes. “Who do you think I am?”  “You’re the dragon king” you said smiling through the tears “the great conqueror”  He stared at you his eyes filled with sorrow. “What is my name?” He asked his voice barely a whisper.  “Aegon” you said the word felt right like it belonged in your mouth but the fear in his eyes told you otherwise.  He pulled away from you moving to the edge of the bed his back to you. He felt your arms wrap around him from behind your breasts pressing against his back your head resting on his shoulder.  “You’re not really Aegon” you whispered “Are you?”  He shook his head his eyes staring at the floor.  “I’m not real?” You asked your hands clutching his shoulders.  “No no you’re not” he whispered.  Suddenly you were kneeling in front of him your hands resting on his thighs your head tilted to look at him.  “Then why can I touch you?” You asked running your hands up his thighs.  He didn’t answer just pulled you into his lap and pressed his lips to yours. You melted into him his hands on your waist his lips parting.  You tasted sweet like honey like a spring day the flowers blooming. He needed you like a fire needs air like a man needs water his hands moving down to your hips pulling you closer.  He moaned into the kiss your hips rolling against him. You could feel his hardness beneath the fabric the heat radiating from him. Your hands untied his shirt pushing the fabric aside revealing his bare chest.  You kissed his neck biting and sucking on the tender skin. He groaned his hands moving to your hair tugging pulling you away from his neck.  You stared at him your eyes dark full of lust your lips swollen. He pulled you back in his mouth crashing into yours his hand moving to the back of your neck holding you in place.  He lifted your skirts his hand dipping beneath the fabric easing a finger inside you. You gasped against his lips his touch sending shivers through your body your hands gripping his shoulders. He slipped another finger inside you pumping slowly then adding another. His eyes never left yours as the intensity increased moving faster your breath coming in short gasps.  Your lips brushed his your voice a breathy moan. “Please my king…. Don’t burn me don’t burn me”  Daemon froze.  “I can’t burn you” he said his voice hoarse. “You’re already dead.”  Your face crumpled the tears flowing freely sobs wracking your body. The sound of you crying echoed strangely in the chamber the shadows growing longer the light from the moon turning crimson.  “I’m dead? You killed me?” You cried trying to pull away from him but he wouldn’t let you go.  “I didn’t kill you” he said his eyes locked on yours. “That was someone else in another time”  You looked at him your eyes wide your mouth open in a silent scream. He watched in horror as your skin began to bubble and blister peeling off in chunks. It was like you turned into sand in his arms slowly crumbling falling through his fingers.  You screamed a blood curdling terrible sound like the screams he had heard in his nightmare. You were being consumed by fire the flames eating away at your flesh burning boiling the smell of burning meat filling the air.  He couldn’t look away couldn’t let go. He was frozen in place trapped watching as you were destroyed. Then you vanished from his lap fading into nothing.  Daemon sat in his bed his skin clammy his breathing ragged. He clutched his head his fingers digging into his scalp. He couldn’t take this anymore. He was going mad.  “Don’t leave me here in this place” he whispered he did not know why he had said it but he did. It was a plea a desperate hopeless plea.  But you had left. Because you were never real.  And this wretched castle was just as lonely as before.,2024-07-11 03:48:21 GMT

Well that’s mostly a lie. He does have feelings for you and has had them for a long time but has always been too scared to act. Mostly he hopes his stolen glances and prolonged touches a hand on your waist when he passes by or on your shoulder as you laugh together he hopes those will be enough and that somehow you’ll just know.  But tensions are high they’ve only been getting worse. Hidden feelings and kept secrets are forced to light at a council meeting when you volunteer to fly with Rhaenys to meet Criston head on.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; TAGLIST ── (if you’re bold it means i wasn’t able to tag you)  @simpingbigtime | @chillingyuh | @themoon-mine | @greenvita | @frostooo | @darylspersonalwhore | @athxnss | @thatbird-fromrio | @yohanseyebrowmole | @koobratzy | @ganertys | @kodzuvk | @lovelyteenagebeard | @m1lilachp | @lotus-888 | @captured-memory | @hummusxx | @rosie-posie08 | @tempo-rary-fix,2024-07-11 03:28:25 GMT

60,House of the Dragon,['game of thrones'  'team green'  'aegon ii targaryen'],aryas-faces,HotD + Failing To Ruin Aegon This is just a very interesting case study because after all the writers did to Aegon they have failed to make the audience hate Aegon   Audiences see Aegon as he is: a young boy who desperately wants love and approval from those around him who was doomed from the start and does bad things but isn’t a bad person. He wants to protect his family he wants to protect his people he fights his own battles and gets hurt but survives through his own courage and will only. How can you not root for him?  Especially when you have Tom Glynn-Carney playing him. Tom understands Aegon like no one else. We see the funny side the sadness the rage the grief the doom. Every move he makes is intentional every micro expression we see the tragedy of it all. Because Aegon as a character is a tragedy. How can you not root for him?  I have seen more and more praise Tom for his incredible performance. But the love for Aegon isn’t only for Tom people have started to enjoy him as a character. They think he is funny heartbreaking adorable desperate. How can you not root for him?  And the in comes Sunfyre; a beautiful dragon who we are immediately endeared to through his interaction with Aegon. And Sunfyre is torn down the same episode along with Aegon. How can you not root for him?  Because just look at Aegon’s character arc: he is his mother’s trauma manifested his father’s neglect manifested he is torn down abused and hurt over and over. All he wants is love but he is told over and over that he is not worthy of love. And it breaks him. It breaks him until there is nothing left but sadness. And then he gets forced against his will to the throne. But he sees people adore him. And it’s the first time he feels loved. And so he tries to protect his people in return but his own council feel they should rule over him. Suddenly everyone around him has their talons in him fighting for control for him while he just tries to do the right the thing. And then Aegon just decides fuck it I will I do it my way. He sees his people being burned and goes faster. He doesn’t back down from a dragon fight he is sure to lose because he won’t allow his people to be burned. And then the worst thing happens: he gets betrayed. By his own brother who he trusted because he did the right thing and went to protect and save his people. How can you not root for him?  This is why these biased showrunners felt they had to make him a rapist who went child fighting pits why they had to ruin him season 1. Because they want to audience head over heels for Rhaenyra and so Aegon to be an irredeemable monster. Because they know this arc is incredible. It is gold  But in the end it was pointless. Because while a lot of people don’t love him as a person they absolutely adore him as a fictional character  Because there’s this simple fact the showrunners can’t run from can’t bias their way out of. They can make Aegon a stupid fool who can’t speak his native tongue whose own council doesn’t need his own family turns against there is a simple fact they can’t escape; Aegon is the most compelling character in the Dance   Aegon is the best character in the Dance,2024-07-11 04:15:11 GMT

Also for the people arguing that because they didn’t get a bonding scene that means their relationship is cold and transactional I’m just gonna paste something i wrote earlier:  My opinion is that when/if they die they’ll get their bonding moment. Thinking logistically outside of the story the main reason why we got those moments with Meleys and Sunfyre is bc they were about to die/get irreparably injured.

So I really truly believe that only whatever is absolutely necessary is being animated.

Vhagar and Aemond are coming out on top in the fight and they’ll live another day so they don’t need a scene like that.

Do they realize we barely have any nice green edits??? And they have to ruin it??? They’re so annoying and I think it’s mostly bc they’re unsupervised teenagers who can’t focus on something for more than 5 seconds I KNOW IT. Most got fans were already adults when the show started and the show had such good writing they didn’t need to do much thinking to understand what was going on but still managed to write some amazing analysis. Go watch any got scene on YouTube no matter who you love or hate every side had something good and clever to say about the characters.

Viserys who ignored his children while chasing the ghosts of Old Valyria. Aemond who felt inferior because he didn’t have a dragon. Aegon and Helaena who were forced to get married even though they didn’t want to. And so on and so forth. Are they betraying this “Targaryen heritage”? Good for them.,2024-07-11 07:47:34 GMT

Many men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her in the first year of her marriage to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign. He had a man’s needs after all and they had spent that year apart Ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her father’s castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb the infant at her breast than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles. And if his seed quickened she expected he would see to the child’s needs.  He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him and called him “son” for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last and Catelyn rode to Winterfell Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence.  That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother not so much as a word but a castle has no secrets and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband’s soldiers.   — A Game of Thrones Catelyn II  Catelyn understands the social rules of the society she lives. She’s been taught the belief that men having affairs and fathering bastards is normal. But even in such a patriarchal society there has to be a level of respect afforded to the wives of the men that cheat (especially if they’re noblewomen from powerful families). In Catelyn’s case she feels slighted because her husband raised his bastard in the same household. It is considered a social insult to Catelyn that her husband did this to her.   She had come to love her husband with all her heart but she had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned’s sake so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight and as he grew he looked more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse.  — A Game of Thrones Catelyn II  Obviously it’s not fair to Jon that Catelyn takes out her resentment on him. Though from her POV chapters it’s shown that she holds no negativity towards Ned’s mystery mistress despite hating Jon. It’s impossible to hate someone you don’t even know. Meanwhile Jon is a living breathing reminder of her husband’s infidelity. While it would be a more reasonable reaction for her to dislike Ned rather than misdirect her negative feelings towards Jon Ned is still her lord husband. It is easier for Catelyn to hate Jon.  When it comes to Rhaenys her husband’s mistress and bastards are relatively unknown to her even if she is aware of their existence. They were kept far away from her. So Rhaenys is less likely to resent them. That’s why Rhaenys addresses only Corlys with barely concealed anger but Alyn doesn’t earn her scorn. The scene between her and Alyn in episode 4 appears to be the first time those two have ever interacted. Rhaenys has not had to live every day with the reminder of her husband’s betrayal. If it’s out of sight it can be (relatively) out of her mind.   I’m sure that the way this show characterizes its female characters as more gentler/calm individuals definitely plays a part with how Rhaenys reacts here too. Which is why the viewers are led to assume Rhaenys just quietly accepted the fact of her husband cheating on her.  In the book Corlys never dared have his bastards around whilst his wife still lived. He kept the affair so discreet that had it not been for him personally presenting the boys at the Red Sowing no one would have assumed him to be the father. Both Addam &amp; Alyn were staying with their mother and serving in her fleet. In the show Alyn is in Corlys’ fleet and therefore more likely to come under notice (and that’s exactly what happens).   Princess Rhaenys his wife had the fiery temperament of many Targaryens Mushroom says and would not have taken kindly to her lord husband fathering bastards on a girl half her age and a shipwright’s daughter besides. Therefore his lordship had prudently ended his “shipyard trysts” with Mouse after Alyn’s birth commanding her to keep her boys far from court. Only after the death of Princess Rhaenys did Lord Corlys at last feel able to bring his bastards safely forward.  — Fire &amp; Blood The Dying of the Dragons  Not only did Corlys have an affair with a young girl (coincidentally the same age Rhaenys was when she married him) but said girl is also a commoner. Rhaenys is a princess who could have been a queen. For Corlys to make his affair public would have been a huge insult to his wife even if he never brought up the matter of his bastards. Rhaenys would have been rightfully furious at the shame her husband’s actions bring upon her. She was the first to speak up when her position as heir was usurped so that suggests she’s not the type to just turn a blind eye to anything she considers an injustice against her. Book version has a far more fiery personality than her show counterpart. Her reaction to the truth would probably be different too.   A detail in episode 4 which I did like is when Rhaenys corrected Alyn about her title. Princess not Lady. She’s asserting her position and status in that moment. Alyn serves the Lord of Driftmark so naturally his Lord’s wife would be a Lady to him. By correcting Alyn Rhaenys places him in the position of an ignorant who does not even know the difference between the titles. Perhaps a subtle expression of classism towards another who is very much beneath her. But the glimmer of antagonism is gone as soon as it appears. Their interaction is not simply Rhaenys welcoming her husband’s bastard with open arms.   The show leaves Rhaenys’ original reaction when she first finds out about the affair to the imagination. So it’s difficult to say what exactly she felt in the moment. Unlike fiery tempered book!Rhaenys the show version is more calm and collected. She is a person who seeks peaceful resolutions to problems (similar to Catelyn) so her reaction in the show makes sense for her even if it’s different from how the book version of her may have reacted. In the HOTD canon we’re basically getting an interpretation of how Catelyn might’ve reacted to Jon had he been raised away from Winterfell.,2024-07-11 07:29:26 GMT

On the roleplay hunt again now with HOTD Season 2 in full swing!   If you’re new to my blog I’m 20 years old (He/They/It pronouns) and I have roughly 7+ years of writing experience - I’m usually a semi-adv literate writer who averages 3-4 paragraphs though I’ll often do my best to match the length of my partner’s reply. I enjoy chatting OOC about characters/dynamics and general plotting so please be aware of that and I also primarily use discord for roleplays though I’m also open to just using Tumblr DMs! I’d also be open to potential group roleplay servers though preferably nothing over the top and fancy (things with official Tumblr blogs for instance while I think they are very neat it’s just not my style with specific edit and fc requirements - I don’t want to spend my motivation on just setting up character information ya know?)  —-  In terms of knowledge I’m most familiar with the show but I’m in the process of reading Fire &amp; Blood and have some knowledge of the ASOIAF book lore due to research for one of my original characters.  For roleplay plots I’m open to canon based canon divergence &amp; AUs in general! I do have a preference for romantic based things as a heads up.  I will be honest I am a sucker for dragons if you couldn’t tell - so I would love some decent dragon involvement if possible since all the characters I wish to play are dragon riders/have the potential to be dragon riders.  For romantic plots I am exclusively looking for MxM pairings - For more general plots (Familial/Platonic) any pairing is fair game. I’m open to canon characters or OC related things while I have a preference for OCs I’m fine with either option alongside potential OCxCanon! The canon characters I’m open to writing and my main OCs are down at the bottom of the post!  I may consider doubling up - though it’s a case by case basis and dependent on the ideas. I generally prefer to put all my focus into one plot but considering the two sided nature of HOTD I’m more open to potentially doubling.  I’m open to canon typical themes here in terms of how ‘dark’ things are - I have few hard limits if I’m honest. Angst/darker plots are also welcome though I would like to have hurt/comfort in there somewhere at the least - I’m not the best with 100% angst all the time even if it’s all a massive tragedy in the end.  Additionally NSFW is also on the table - if it happens and we want to write/plan for it I’m totally down for it if not that is also completely okay!  —  Characters I’m Looking to Write  Note: I’m new to writing canon cast characters - so please be open to my interpretations as they may not be 100% accurate to either show or book canon.  —-  Canon Characters:  Laenor   Aegon II   Jaecarys/Jace   Lucerys/Luke   Daeron   Addam of Hull  —  Original Characters:  - The Dragon Thief || Carden Waters  “I think we all know how my coin landed so why shouldn’t I burn it all down? What else am I good for then?”  Carden is a ticking time bomb of a dragonseed the unfortunate spawn of Daemon Targaryen - he holds notable distain and hatred towards his half blood family for a multitude of reasons. Just like any person though he’s a mess of emotions and motivations being desperate to make something of himself in the greater scheme of the world especially with the tension in the realm being at an all time high.  Full Character Information     - || Gryfinn Cantrill  “Well I’m sorry I never asked for any of this! I’m doing my best to enjoy what I have and it was going great until now- I didn’t expect to end up actually giving a fuck about anyone-”  Gryfinn of the Vale - a young man who’s been called beautiful more often than handsome due to his well groomed nature being known through rumors and things of the like to be a man with little care who has slept his way through half the brothels in The Vale. While having a slightly unsavory reputation and often the first to make snide or crude remarks he currently lives amongst those of House Arryn in the Eyrie - by request to assist his cousin Lady Jeyne with certain affairs.   Gryfinn in truth is a quick witted and clever man who often has his own interests in mind due to how his mother and father lord over him despite being a man grown. He’s been holding off the inevitability of being married off by them for years now and he’s aware he may be running out of time - so he’s only seemed to grow more bitter towards most people minus the few closer to him.     - The Dragonskin || Olivar Pyke   “I think it’s because I’m like them in a way… Neither of us truly belong anywhere not anymore”   A skinchanger of Targaryen descent from the Iron Islands Olivar was born blind and has lived most of his life hidden behind walls - a secret to the world in more ways than just being a useless bastard. He shares a unique bond with a wild dragon called Shipbreaker though according to Olivar her name is Vethimax or that is her preferred name at the least. This bond is something more mutual than that of most skinchangers and their other forms. The dragon herself understands Olivar in a way and allows him to take control of her body from time to time allowing for this unique bond between them to develop - that and Olivar’s bastard lineage which also makes this possible. Though there’s more to this bond than even Olivar knows.  Olivar himself is a soft spoken and oddly calm individual he’s cautious and respectful around anyone regardless of who they are. He’s good at keeping aware of his surroundings despite his lack of sight but still struggles in many aspects due to having little education or instruction throughout his life.  —-  Note: I am also open to potentially making new OCs depending on the plots! I have a few other concepts these are just my most fleshed out fellas.  —  If you’re interested in potentially doing an RP I would prefer if you DM me but you can also like this post and I’ll do my best to get back to you! (I’ve been having issues with dming people myself due to blogs not showing up in the message search so please don’t take it personally if you don’t hear back from me!),2024-07-11 07:22:20 GMT

It is the only opportunity for Aeron to gaze upon Bellena Blackwood but time is running short as both hands are up for marriage. Aeron persistent to speak to her at least once takes his chance.  Warnings: none; mentioned drinking/some alcohol consumption  Authors Note: firstly ben = davos obvi. secondly I have read all three of the aeron fics on here and massive credit and thanks to these writers since NO ONE else is giving love to the ethereal prince that is ryan kopel. so i’m gonna throw my hand in the pot. also i haven’t posted a fic since the quotev days (iykyk) so please be gentle. reblogs/comments/writing advice all welcome!! hope you enjoy! (Bellena pronounced as Beh-Lay-Nuh or Buh-Leh-Nuh) (also… let’s just pretend the brackens did NOT poison the blackwood’s weirwood tree… vile rumors lmao)  Work Count: 4.3k  Lord Grover held a banquet and melee but once every three years a gathering and celebration of the Riverland constituents with invitation to the whole of the Realm though only mostly Rivermen partook. Aeron had been to five so far well technically six but the first as a babe so he did not recall much. This was to be his seventh.   Though Lord Grover was abed the last three occasions it did not stop his Lady wife and grandsire from continuing the tradition for which Aeron was grateful. It was the only time he was allowed to see her. To gaze upon her without the worry of being called a turncoat or worse.   Bellena Blackwood was his ancestral rival a younger sister to Aeron’s biggest competitor and the most beautiful girl in the Riverlands. Her thick long black hair and pale skin drew in many suitors from across the Realm even rich traders from Lannisport and Oldtown reaching out to extend their own hands but all were denied promptly.  Aeron’s Lord uncle talked of it constantly berating his own rival Lord Blackwood as foolish for not accepting any for the hand of his precious daughter. It only pleased Aeron each denial a certainty she would remain close even though it was across borderlines.   Every contest Lord Blackwood gave meant Aeron would have the chance to see her again but his hope was drawing thin as she grew older. Seventeen was still an acceptable marrying age in the Realm but a year or two more would begin to press the Blackwood’s luck as the whole of Westeros knew. Aeron was sure Bellena’s father would choose soon and it made him sick to his stomach at the thought. A distant lord taking her as his own bringing her far away from home and siring his lowly heirs on her.   He had tried to face reality; swearing the girl off in his mind after each sighting and repenting his thoughts to the Seven on his journey home afterwards. But another banquet would come and she would still be un-promised and he was right back where he was years prior. An endless loop that was starting to affect him now as letters began to arrive for his own hand. There’d only been a few which was why Aeron thought his uncle had not noticed just yet; most like assuming the worst of the lot was early and his nephew was right to dismiss them. He was half correct given that. His uncle trusted him as the heir to Stone Hedge and had graciously allowed Aeron the chance to choose his own Lady wife but Aeron could feel himself squandering it. It made him feel a-fool selfish even but he did not want the girls mentioned in these letters by their Lord fathers. He wanted her.   —-  They were late. Though Riverrun’s closest neighbors the Brackens arrived at the banquet to find many a coat of arms already waving claiming encampments on the Tully’s lush green. Aeron could hear his Lord uncle’s irritated muttering as they passed each trying to find an opening to pitch their own tents. At the sight of the Blackwood coat of arms a dead weirwood surrounded by ravens on a field of red his uncle spit the glob flying back to land at Aeron’s horse’s hooves.  “Even the bloody Blackwoods have already settled. We should have left when I said Aeron.” His uncle shot him a pointed look as they drew closer to their rival’s camp. Aeron could feel his cheeks redden with heat. He’d held up their departure trying on several sets of armor showcasing them in his looking glass to end up disgusted with each and how they fell upon his person. He had been knighted only recently and wanted to be presentable handsome even for the upcoming melee. He didn’t want to just look at Bellena this year; he wanted her to look upon him. He’d finally ended up choosing a set of silver steel with the Bracken horse risen off the metal on his chest the matching helmet extending a short tuff of horsehair off its backside.  As they finally passed the Blackwood encampment a tension fell as his uncle and the men accompanying them exchanged eyes with the men at arms guarding the tent. His uncle spit again towards these men before moving on.   Aeron had felt himself slowing on his horse now inching by as he tried to catch a glimpse of her through the open entrance using the opportunity as his uncle’s head was turned away. She wasn’t inside however none of the Blackwoods were. He could feel a frown forming on his face.   “Aeron!” He looked up to see his uncle twenty feet ahead turned with the rest of the company to stare back down to where Aeron had stopped. Aeron hadn’t realized he’d fully stilled to gawk at the encampment and his red face deepened with color. His uncle quirked his head as if to say ‘What are you doing?’   Aeron gave a quick nudge to the stallion below him and he rejoined the party issuing a quick apology unable to hide his embarrassment in his look. His uncle mistook it for other reasons however and Aeron almost breathed a sigh of relief as Lord Amos spoke.   He placed a hand upon his nephew’s shoulder shaking him lightheartedly.   “You’ll have time to butt heads with Samwell’s heir later we must set the tent first.” Aeron nodded quickly as Lord Amos gave him a small knowing smile his uncle himself having a life long feud with Raventree’s Lord. It fueled him as he thought it did Aeron so no suspicion was raised. Their party continued on for a few minutes more before finding a spot at the end of the camp’s alleyway and they began to set up their new home for the next week.   —-  “And though my grandsire cannot join us I hope this banquet enough to satisfy and remind us of our unity as Rivermen.” Aeron could feel himself falling asleep in the back of the hall his House’s late arrival attributing to the position of their seats closest to the entrance. He’d heard the same excusing speech the last three banquets the only thing changing the voice of Oscar Tully which had not yet deepened but was certainly not as high as the previous gathering. He could see the young heir look towards his Lady grandmother a Frey by birth asking for confirmation. She nodded at him a small proud smile on her lips. He turned back to his future vassals and raised a small fist in the air.   “Let the celebrations begin!” The hall erupted into applause Aeron joining them banging his cup with the rest and letting out a loud whistle. Food was served and cups refilled the conversation heavy in the air before Aeron grew the confidence to let his gaze begin searching the other tables. He spotted Mootons Hawicks and an abundance of Freys before his eyes found the red and black party. They sat two tables away fourteen men total jeering and rocking each other as they drank ate and laughed. She was easy to spot amongst the muck. Ben’s back was to Aeron so the Bracken let himself stare unworried of being caught.  She was seated next to her father opposite her brother sipping at her cup and watching the men of her house with a shy smile. This was one of the few outings she was allowed to attend so her behavior was controlled and docile; an expectation of her. She took a moment to glance around still sipping bouncing to the music that Riverrun’s ensemble performed. Aeron could feel his heart shudder almost choking on his drink hoping she’d look his way but also hoping she wouldn’t; whatever that could be conveyed as. It was embarrassing fawning over her like a lovesick knight in a story. He’d barely spoken two words to her his whole life not that the knights in the stories had any such luck either. She did not end up looking his way disappointing and relieving him all the same. He continued nursing his cup looking over the rim as he studied her.  Her hair was longer but she must’ve cut it sometime between the last banquet and now only a few inches added to its length. Wavy and thick it framed her face frizzing in the humidity of the hall’s activity. She wore red an exquisite dress with the shoulders cut out the fabric returning at her forearms with sleeves widened and flared to allow the free movement of her hands. A black cape with the Blackwood coat of arms laid pinned upon her shoulders cascading behind her and most like touching the floor. She was shorter than him after all and his own cape brushed the stone as he sat. He wondered how she would look in gold; if it would agree with her complexion or hinder it. Aeron felt his lips turn in and he chewed them thinking drink still in hand but no longer tended to. She looked so beautiful tonight a woman grown and he gazed on unnoticed. Or so he thought.   “Who are you looking at?” Aeron jumped at his squire’s words some of his wine spilling onto the table in front of him. Alfred one of the boys he’d taken on in his recent knighting had accompanied him and Lord Amos the anticipation of the incoming week’s melee providing need of him. He sat beside Aeron at the table leaning into him to look where the Bracken heir’s line of sight ended. Aeron remained silent looking at his squire struggle and unable to think of an excuse and for a moment he did think it the best course of action; pretending he hadn’t been caught watching the Blackwood girl. That was until the rest of his house’s party turned their attention towards him all eyebrows raised up in question.   Aeron tongue knotted itself tighter as they all began to look where his squire did even his Lord uncle. He could see their eyes drifting towards the Blackwoods settling on their rivals. A brief silence passed before his uncle started laughing cutting the tension and making Aeron flinch. All turned back with Lord Amos as he reached across the table grabbing Aeron’s wrist and shaking it good-heartedly.   “The melee will soon be upon us Aeron. You’ll have your chance with the boy.” Aeron nodded finally taking in breath for the one he was holding shocked at his stealth. He was so deftly obvious in his infatuation but he supposed the idea of him ogling over Lady Bellena was far-fetched in his uncle’s eyes; the idea of his nephew itching to maim the Blackwood heir the surer possibility. At least now he could look on uninterrupted referring to that as the sole reason for his persistent gape. As the conversation settled against his ears once more his eyes moved again to his rival’s table.   She was chatting with her brother now nodding and watching him slosh his drink Ben explaining a story in great detail an inaudible laugh escaping her every now and then. As she smiled at her kin Aeron felt his own lips rise with hers mimicking her reactions. He began to nurse his drink again as he watched the two converse.   —-  An hour or two passed and he’d managed to bring himself back to his own house’s banter a few times but his eyes always seemed to return to Bellena. Her presence alluring him away from his reality; this reality. Him being over here and her there not close by any means but making his gut flip-flop as if he stood next to her and could feel her warmth.  The sky had already darkened some men leaving the feast but most still present drunk and enjoying themselves. Bellena’s eyes had started drooping the hour previous the wine getting to her head most like. He could see her blushing cheeks from here red from the over-consumption.   Bellena stood up suddenly and on cue he also straightened his back almost rising with her. She exchanged a brief word with her company before turning walking towards the exit. Before she made more than a few paces Ben had jumped up almost falling from his drunken stupor lifting his cup towards her and saying something Aeron could not make out. It did not amuse Bellena who’s warm smile turned to a grimace of annoyance. She shot a quick word back at him before walking off leaving her brother swaying at the table. She departed passing but six feet away from Aeron on exit his eyes following her all the while. He turned his attention back to the Blackwood heir watching him fall back into his seat as the man beside him clapped his shoulder his Lord father speaking to him now face stern. This was Aeron’s chance. All he wanted was to speak with her; know her at least before she was given away. Dull this longing in his heart. She may very well disappoint him and set his mind straight; she a Blackwood and he a Bracken mortal enemies. Some part of him hoped she would not.   Aeron shot up in his seat nearly frightening his squire and startling his chatting party. All looks turned towards him as conversation ceased. He nearly stumbled over his words as they came.   “I’m quite fatigued. I think I may take my leave to bed now.” His uncle’s brows furrowed briefly before shrugging.   “You may do as you like Aeron. Sleep well.”   The discussion continued and Aeron stepped away from his seat but halted as he felt a body rise beside him. He turned to see Alfred lustily finishing his cup before bringing it down again to the table as he spoke.  “I’ll escort you Ser.”   Aeron’s next word slipped out hurriedly sounding pressed.   “No!” He glimpsed his uncle who still chatted away but the Lord’s eye was trained on his nephew brow furrowed again. Aeron drove on a feeble excuse pouring from his lips.   “No you stay Alfred. Enjoy yourself.” He reached out giving the squire’s shoulder a squeeze a tight smile upon his face.   Alfred’s eyes widened with shock briefly but his face quickly turned into a grin as he nodded.   “Whatever you say Ser.” He sat back down grabbing the wine pitcher and refilling his cup. Aeron turned back to the rest of his company giving them a curt nod before leaving his uncle’s gaze following him as he headed towards the exit.   Aeron shook off his nerves as soon as he entered the castle passageway breathing away his anxiety and calming his heartbeat. He’d done it again. Perhaps in a more curious nature than before but without assumption. His eyes trailed the hallway in all directions but he did not spot Bellena. Each path led back out the castle and onto the green that held the visiting houses so she could have gone either route. Aeron eyes drifted upwards silently praying to the Crone for wisdom to help him choose the right course. It was not a whisper in his ear but as he stood there he felt himself being pulled to the left; the urge in his mind badgering him onwards. Aeron thanked the Crone quietly and turned walking quickly down the passage.   He passed Riverrun’s inner gardens traveling by the Godswood on his way to the encampments. He halted abruptly though as he saw a figure standing in front of the weirwood tree. Although the urge to continue coursed through him he found himself drawing slowly towards and into the old grove.   As Aeron drew closer he’d realized he had found her after all for it was Bellena admiring the ancient tree. His heartbeat grew rapid his hands automatically reaching to dust his leathers and tunic though they were clean. He stood there for a moment just watching and admiring her the skin upon her face luminous as the moon shone on the parts he could see. Her hair was almost too dark to notice if not for its glint in the moonlight as well. She had her hands clasped in front of her staring at something on the weirwood he did not see nor notice.   They were alone here and Aeron seized the opportunity knowing this to be the only time they’d likely get to speak. Their first and last time to talk. As he stepped forward a crack echoed through the Godswood. He looked down only now noticing the dead branch in his path. He cursed himself inwardly. Fuck. He hadn’t wanted to scare her.   She was not frightened however not even turning to see who’d made the racket. Her voice was enticing heavenly even as it raised itself in annoyance.   “Ben leave me alone.” Aeron was not Ben however so he did not respond remaining where he stood unsure if he should say anything now. She was clearly irritated and he did not want to burden her further. He wondered if this had all been a mistake a rash decision of the heart that was ill-timed. Perhaps he’d have another chance throughout the week. Perhaps he should just leave. Before he could make up his mind and come to a decision Bellena had whipped her body around hair and dress flowing at the speed.   “I said to leave me alone!” Her nose was scrunched in anger malice all over her face. It drained at the realization it was not her brother. “Oh.” Her face turned into one of confusion as she stared at Aeron one dark eyebrow lifting. “It’s you.”   Aeron stood stock still. The accusation was not laced with much displeasure but she’d certainly seen the red stallion rearing upon his chest. That much was evident her gaze lingering on it as she examined him.  Aeron was tongue-tied. He’d spent years thinking of what to say how to start a conversation daydreaming of it most nights. All of those went swimmingly but reality was catching up to him quickly. She spoke again breaking the eerie silence for him.   “You are in the wrong sept Bracken.”   Aeron could feel his body almost breathe with relief. He had daydreamed something similar so he went along with the script almost instinctively forgetting all nervousness.  “Yet the old gods are not like to turn a weary man away.” She lifted her brow again.   “Weary of what?” He paused before finding his footing. He slowly made his way over before he came to settle but two feet from her. Respectful of the Lady but also making the conversation private.   “Of a Lady such as yourself walking alone back to camp. There are many drunkards roaming these grounds tonight.” The tiniest curve came to her lips before she pursed them looking back to the weirwood.   “No one will touch me I assure you. My brother would have the head of any man who dared to do so.”   Aeron studied her as she spoke raking over her face memorizing all its angles before glancing at her lips. She turned back to him chewing on them for all but a moment while waiting for his response. Red and plump their curve lifted higher as she noticed his silent gawk. He thought of Ben what he’d do if he saw them together and if he would have a go at his head. Aeron welcomed him to try.   “Is that all Bracken?” She tilted her head just so eyes going up and down slowly surveying his whole frame. He could feel his heart stutter in his chest. Was she toying with him?   It doubled his confidence instantaneously.   “Aeron.” The curve of her lips turned into a smirk her response swift.   “I know your name.”   Although it left him at a loss for words he felt his own lips turn up admiring her wit. A comfortable silence passed between them. Perhaps because he could hold some semblance of a conversation or just the fact that he was not nipping at her heels for a fight. This was probably the calmest discussion a Bracken and Blackwood had in well a thousand years. She turned back to the tree and he turned with her though he was not sure what to look for. She broke the quiet her voice soft.   “It’s dying.” Aeron looked closer before glancing at her.   “How do you know?” She shrugged lifting her hand to point at the weirwood’s ghostly eyes carved into the bark before setting it back down beside her.   “It’s stopped crying.” It was Aeron’s turn to raise his brow now. He took an even closer look leaning forward. She was right the blood that usually weeped from the tree’s gaze dry and beginning to peel. It looked to have stopped recently. Her next word was but a whisper.   “Pity.”   Aeron looked at her fully then watching her eyes scan the ancient relic sorrowful. He could feel himself fill with sympathy for her; the loss to her religion. The words came to him before his thoughts could conceive them.   “It is. I’m sorry.”   Bellena’s gaze drifted back to his offering him a slight smile now.   “It’s alright it was bound to happen eventually. Riverrun’s worshipped the Seven for a long while now. You have my gratitude though.” She nodded at him another brief smile gracing her lips. “I suppose the hour is late so I will wish you a good night and good luck in the upcoming melee.” She nodded again before she turned and started to walk off. Aeron’s eyes widened almost reaching his arm out to stop her withdrawing body but restraining himself. Watching her stride away he tried to think of something to continue their talk; anything. It came to him at once.   “The weirwood still bleeds at Stone Hedge.” She halted abruptly but did not turn back towards him. He stared at the dead tree stitched upon her back as he rambled. “It bled when I was a child and it still bleeds now. I don’t visit it often; it frightens me a little if I’m being honest.” She tilted her head back listening one eye on him. He continued “You may come see it if you like if-if you’d want to see it I mean.” He stammered over his last words realizing what he’d said and all the implications that came with it. A Blackwood visiting Stone Hedge; a most ludicrous jest. He didn’t want to seem as if he was mocking her he truly meant what he’d said. He cursed himself again. Idiot. He felt like hitting himself.   Before Aeron could process too focused on berating himself Bellena had turned and strolled back to him appearing but inches from him their chests almost touching. Aeron stood there eyes wide and body vibrating in anticipation. He hoped he’d not just ruined everything; hoped she didn’t slap him though he probably deserved it. Her voice still soft and calm as before reached his waiting ears.   “You have a living weirwood on Bracken land?” He only nodded as he couldn’t do much else his tongue stiff once more. “Where you’ve worshipped the Seven for gods know how long?” It was rhetorical almost offensive though he took no offense only nodding again. “And it still bleeds and blooms?” Another nod of his head.   Bellena narrowed her eyes pursing her lips once more and Aeron’s gaze fell right to them. They were so close that if he leaned forward he could kiss her easily but he would want her permission first. That was a necessity; he could never force himself upon her. He’d thought of it before and it only filled him with disgust. He much rather preferred his dreams of her wanting for him as well. His eyes drew back to hers as her voice came again.   “Hmm. Perhaps I should become Bracken then. The old gods do seem to favor the heretics.” His eyes widened further at the words both his brows rising not sure he’d heard her right. It took a moment for it to dawn on him but as her lips twisted into a smirk again he was sure of it. She was flirting with him. His heart pounded wildly as her gaze ran over him once more going from his eyes down to his boots and back. She continued before Aeron could stutter out a response.   “Sleep well Aeron.” She spun on her heels making for her final departure but Aeron’s hand sprang from his side before he could think grabbing her wrist delicately. Bellena glanced at his hold around her and then back up to his eyes her gaze suspicious and curious of his bold action. Aeron loosed his grip quickly dropping her wrist not wanting her to think him too brash. He had no idea what he was doing he just didn’t want her to leave but he knew he couldn’t keep her here against her will. He cleared his throat.  “Goodnight Bellena.” Her eyes softened almost immediately her lips turning up into another small smile as she reached for his hand now. She grasped it giving him a gentle squeeze as his mind raced. He thought his heart may burst from the contact the texture of her skin soft as silk the size of her hand so small and delicate as he looked downwards and watched it sit in his. It left suddenly her along with it. He could still feel the ghost of her touch as his gaze drifted back upwards watching her go hair bouncing as she walked off towards camp.,2024-07-11 07:14:12 GMT
499,House of the Dragon,['helena targaryen x reader'  'aemond targaryen x reader'  'bonniebird'],bonniebird,Helena’s companion Helena x Fem!Reader / Aemond x Fem!Reader  AN: Full on fix it fic. Started as Aemond x Reader but after the first episode I ended up just rescuing Helena. Not sorry. Hopefully people enjoy.      It hadn’t taken Aemond long to realise that people for some inexplicable reason assumed that the loss of one eye had robbed him of his peripheral vision in the other. It was how he had been able to read notes his grandfather assumed were just out of his eyeline or keep an eye on people who thought they were out of view.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Today was one such moment. Helena was sprawled across a thick blanket under the Weirwood tree of the Red Keep with her companion from the Reach. Aemond sat in the sun and studied the tree before him. Able to easily watch Helena and her friend without anyone questioning him. Aegon was otherwise detained and Aemond was taking advantage of not having him buzzing in his ear like a fat fly. Aemond was no fool he was aware of your beauty. He just didn’t appreciate the lude way his brother admired it. Aegon would whisper about running hands over soft skin the smell of your hair and the gentle fabrics running off your skin as you were undressed by rougher hands. Aemond stood abruptly to snap himself from such thoughts. The action drew the attention of the two girls under the tree but did little more to keep their curiosity as he awkwardly turned and retreated inside.  “Mother says that she had found more fabric in the colour you favour.” Helena said with a sweet smile as she laid her head back down on the long tube-like pillow. You turned your head away from Aemond’s retreating figure and smiled at her as you played with a long piece of grass twirling it between your fingers making it dance and spin.   “I thought she could not?” You asked and Helena shook her head.  “The trader found out that she was looking for more. Grandfather has agreed to introduce him to someone in Old Town. He’s giving Mother enough for two more dresses.” Helena grinned and you beamed a happy smile at her.  “I shall not say a word about it until your mother tells me. She shall be happy to deliver the news after such hard work.” You said rather gleefully and Helena gave you an eager nod. The rest of the afternoon was spent whispering and gossiping about life within the keep until the sun became too hot and the two of you retreated.  Alicent came across the two as you walked arms twined together and hands clutched. You smiled as you greeted her while Helena gave her mother the usual slightly over-eager greeting bestowed upon only a few people.  “Good afternoon Alicent.” You said and smiled giving her the best curtsy you could while being clung to by Helena. Alicent smiled at you a rare genuine smile that was an elusive sight from the queen nowadays.  “(Y/N). Helena dear the children. They ask for you.” Alicent said and Helena nodded muttering that she would go to them. Helena let go of your arm but only after a promise that you would join her and the children after finding someone to bring food and drink to the room. Alicent watched her leave and then turned to tell you her news of the fabrics Helena had mentioned earlier.  “Helena has already told you.” Alicent said with some amusement. You crinkled your face and winced a little.  “She did. But she wished for me to keep quiet. She knows you worked hard and we wanted you to be the one to tell me. You know how Helena and secrets do not get along.” You said and smiled when Alicent nodded.  “Well. You will have new dresses soon. I am honoured to be able to find more of that fabric you love. I hear the maker has passed of old age. It is the last of it.” Alicent said as she walked with you to a clutch of maids. They each curtsied to Alicent who instructed them on what foods to take up to Helena before leading the way to Helena’s chambers.  “I shall have to save some of the fabric. I shall have your family sigil embroidered onto it as a keepsake. In case the dresses become worn.” You said and smiled at Alicent who seemed to appreciate the youthful offer. “Thank you.”   “It has been my pleasure.” Alicent gave you another smile and reached out to squeeze your shoulder in a motherly way. She paused and frowned as if she had just remembered something. “You have not by chance seen Aemond?”  “He was with us earlier but he hurried off. I am not sure where he went.” You answered sincerely. Alicent nodded and thanked you when you promised to tell him she was looking for him if you saw him. She left you to continue your trek up the many stairs of the keep to Helena’s rooms.  “(Y/N)!” Jaehera cried as she saw you. She rushed to her feet and stumbled her way over to you arms wide as she waited for you to sweep her up into a hug. Her little arms wrapped around your neck and she pressed her forehead to the side of your face as you joined Helena in sitting with Jaeherys. The boy was slowly reading a page of writing to Helena. It was obvious that someone had spent hours with him drilling into his head exactly what the words said and that he likely couldn’t actually read the paper. Helena beamed with pride all the same. You sat beside her shifting the girl in your arms to your lap so she was comfortable. When Jaeherys finished you all loudly applauded. He looked rather bashful and shyly came to greet you.  “Very good.” You said with a smile and he nodded.   *************************  Alicent frowned at you. If you had not known her as well as you knew your own mother you might think she was disapproving of you. She shook her head and gently pulled at the soft fabric of the unfinished dress that was draped over you.  “No. It… This fabric is the last of its kind and (Y/N) is one of the most important people to Helena. You can do better than this.” Alicent demanded and turned to a nervous group of seamstresses. They looked at you as if you could temper Alicent’s wroth. They did not seem to realise that you one of the few truly loved by the woman did not have the power to dissuade her passion when it came to your care.  “By my… your gr…” The eldest woman stuttered. Aemond entered the room and stood by the door as Alicent scolded the woman. He stiffened and looked attentive when Alicent called his name.  “Look at this. It’s wrong is it not. I can see through it for Seven’s sake!” Alicent gestured to you and you gave Aemond a shy smile as he frowned.  “It is somewhat revealing.” Aemond said quietly. Alicent nodded and started making a list of demands. When Alicent finally dismissed you Aemond offered his arm and a means of a speedy retreat saying that Aegon needed to speak with her.  “I thought it looked nice.” Aemond said. The two of you strolled the long corridors with no destination in mind.  “Thank you. I think sometimes your mother worries. She did swear to mine to care for me as she would Helena. Which is not to say that I do not appreciate the mothering.” You added and Aemond chuckled.  “It can be… overwhelming at times.” Aemond said and smiled as you stopped near one of the open corridors that looked out at the sea and laughed.  “I am glad we understand each other.” You confessed and looked out of the large window. A comfortable silence fell over you both. Aemond found himself staring at you. He often did but now he couldn’t help but admire the way you look in the sun. The light catching in your hair and lips slightly parted as you appreciated the breeze that relived the stifling summer for a moment. His gaze fell to your chest as you sighed appreciatively at the feeling before he looked away and scolded himself. His mind wandered and he was helpless against the flash of images that he tried not to linger on. Lips parted by sweet sighs his hands running along soft skin tangling in your hair. The way you could sigh his name.  “Aemond?” Cole’s voice jolted Aemond from his thoughts. When he blinked and looked around he realised that you were gone and Cole was calling him from the end of the corridor.  “What is it?” Aemond asked. Cole sighed and shrugged a little.  “The whore and her brood have arrived. It seems your brother plans to negotiate with her. He’s thrown your grandfather out and taken his position as hand from him. Your mother wishes for you to join him. Your brother says he will only allow you in there with him.” Cole gestured for him to follow and Aemond did just that. He could hear his mother hysterically shouting with her father in a room nearby.   When he entered the room it was deathly quiet. Aemond was surprised that his uncle wasn’t at the table instead Rhaenys sat beside his half-sister.   **********  “Mother…” Helena said slowly. She spoke as if she expected Alicent to descend into an uproar at any moment. Alicent was brushing poor Jaehaera’s hair and had become so unfocused that the poor girl began to look like a cat being pet too hard. Helena glanced at you as if she was unsure what to say but recognised that someone should rescue the child who though happy to be fussed over did look rather desperate to escape. “Mother I do not think you should worry so…”  “How can I not worry!” Alicent’s voice cracked against the silence and made everyone in the room jump. Alicent sighed and put the brush down allowing her granddaughter to flee to her mother’s arms.  “I do not think Rhaenyra will be as ruthless as you think she might be. Could someone so cruel make a boy like Jace? He’s very kind.” Helena said trying to soothe her mother who sighed and leaned forward in her seat cupping her head in her hands. It had been late morning when Aemond had been summoned to Aegon. It was now late in the evening.  “I… do not know what to think about anything.” Alicent muttered with reluctance as if it pained her to admit it.   “I can read.” Jaeherys said in a tone that made it clear he thought he might be helpful and smiled. Helena thanked him for the offer but asked him to take his sister with the maids to get ready for bed instead. The boy took his sister’s hand and led the way across the room to a door that led to the children’s bedroom.  “Aemond will not let Aegon get out of hand.” Helena said with certainty. After that no one said anything else. Beyond the children coming and requesting good night wishes as an attempt to stay up later. After they were gone there was nothing else to do but wait.   You must have fallen asleep at some point. You were still on the long bench seat you’d been sitting on with Helena but she was gone. The fabric she’d been embroidering was neatly folded and placed under your head with a pillow and you recognised the blanket that had been tossed over you as one of Alicent’s that she liked to use when she came to sit with Helena in the evening. Sitting up and looking around the room you spotted Helena and Alicent in one corner around a table while Otto and Aemond spoke rather frantically. When you sat up Alicent glanced your way and reached out to Aemond. He glanced at you hesitated then nodded and walked over.  “Is everything alright?” You asked and Aemond let out a slow sigh as he reached out to help you to your feet. In your still sleepy state you leaned heavily on Aemond who accepted your weight and helped you to the door.  “Mother does not want you to worry. She has promised to come to you in the morning.” He muttered as he seemed to decide it would be quicker to simply carry you. Ordinarily you would have objected but you were so tired and everyone was so frantic you decided to simply sink into Aemond as he hurried to your rooms. Your eyes fell shut with the sway of Aemond’s body. There was a slight breeze but he sheltered you from it. You became aware of him settling you down in your bed but found your eyes too heavy to open. The blankets were pulled around you and then a small sweet kiss was placed on your forehead. You weren’t sure if you had imagined it or not it was fleeting. A momentary brush across your forehead.  *********************  There was an uneasiness to the morning when you woke. It was so potent that you could feel it in the air. Deciding to wait a moment longer before getting up you rolled over stuffing one hand under the pillow and relaxing again. The room was bright with morning sunlight but you were determined to make the most of the cooler hours knowing that it would be horrifyingly hot later in the day.   A shuffling in the room made you snap your eyes open. You had a maid of your own. A young woman who had worked for your family but she always knocked and it was the same way each time. So much so that anyone who resided in the Keep knew it was her.  Sitting up you spotted Aemond. He was sitting up in a chair by the door leaning against the wall. He looked as if he were sleeping but his hand still clutched the sword leaning against his leg as tightly as you would expect of a man ready to leap into action. His clothes were different from the ones he had been wearing when he helped you to your rooms. Even asleep he looked tired. You couldn’t help but wonder what had happened.  The familiar knock sounded before your maid entered the room and greeted you quietly. “Has he been here all morning?” You asked her and she nodded as she hurried to pick out a dress for you.  “He came back in the night. He woke me and instructed me to pack in case you needed to flee. Something is going on.” She explained quickly. You nodded slowly and frowned as you followed her behind the small room divider across the room. She helped you change your clothes and fixed your hair so it would be neat and out of your face. When you rounded the room divider you found Aemond had woken and was standing awkwardly looking at the floor.  “I… did not mean to fall asleep.” He confessed. You smiled and assured him that it was fine.  “Will you tell me what has happened?” You asked and Aemond frowned. He sheathed his sword before stepping closer to you.  “I… Aegon has made some decisions that have worried my mother and grandfather. Mother wanted me to make sure you were safe.” Aemond said reluctantly. It was clear that was all he was going to reveal so you nodded quietly and followed him out of your rooms. You had expected him to lead you to Helena’s rooms. You usually had breakfast with her and the children before going on a trek across the keep to Alicent’s rooms to spend the morning with her. But today there was no excited sound from the children. The torches down some halls had not been extinguished from the night before yet.   Instead Aemond led the way to the hall where meals with guests were normally held. He hesitated and looked at the guards near the door. You didn’t recognise them though you only really knew the guards that protected you and Helena and a few that protected Alicent. He opened the door allowing you in before him.   To your surprise the hall was full. The long table had been laid up. On one side Aegon sat with Alicent and Helena. There was an empty chair a comfortable one that was usually left for Otto. Another empty chair sat beside one of the twins. Helena turned in her seat and gave you a pleading look and a nod to the chair silently asking you to take up vigil on the other side of her children. Aemond went to the other chair not bothering to ask where Otto was. When you were sitting you were able to observe the opposite side of the table. You recognised Rhaenys who was opposite Aemond. Opposite Alicent sat a familiar woman who shot her several sly glances when you thought she wasn’t looking and realised that it was Rhaenyra. You hadn’t seen her since Laena Velaryon’s funeral. Looking across the table you tried to recall the names of all her children. The girls one sitting beside an older boy and the other with the younger boy. Him you remembered Lucaerys. Aemond had returned to the keep convinced that he had killed the boy. Only to find days later that he had washed up on a beach. There was a rumour that a fisherman’s family had found him and taken him in until someone recognised him and word reached Rhaenyra. The girl with him would be Rhaena. The other two Jace and Baela.  The breakfast was the most awkward dinner you had ever eaten in your life and you once attended a dinner during which Aegon had been so drunk he’d fallen from his chair and kicked a plate full of food at a guest as he tumbled to the floor. There was either a heavy silence or a question put out into the room that was really intended as a verbal stab.   “Daemon could not join us?” Alicent asked. Rhaenyra’s face stiffened and she cleared her throat.   “No.” She answered coldly. The rest of the breakfast followed much of the same. Despite the awkwardness Jace nodded at you from over the table.  “Forgive me. You looked strikingly similar to a lord Terren Rane. His daughter looks just like you.” Jace said politely. You smiled as you gulped down your mouthful and found everyone staring at you or their plates.  “He is a cousin of my mothers. My parents are both kin to lords of the Reach.” You answered and Jace nodded. He glanced at Baela who gave you a kind smile.  “I met him not too long ago. He is a good man. I am sure your parents are the same.” Jace said and you found yourself giving him a flattered smile.  “Thank you Prince Jacaerys.” You muttered and quickly reached for your drink. He glanced at Baela again who gave him a more amused smile this time. Down at the other end of the table there was a loud clanging and a thump as if someone had slammed their hand down on the table. Alicent could be heard hissing a whisper at someone you assumed Aemond. The rest of the meal remained awkward with Aegon making a few attempts to chat with Rhaenyra. Once the children began to fuss Helena requested to take them to their room. The two of you hurried them out after a short nod from Rhaenyra.  “That was… interesting.” You said as Helena picked up Jaehera and you took Jaeharys’ hand when he refused to be carried. Helena nodded thoughtfully and led the way to the children’s room. As soon as you reached it the children hurried off to play with the carefully carved wooden toys. Helena sat down on the bench seat near the fire with a heavy sigh and leaned back in the seat. You slowly joined her and reached for her hand.  “Aemond has not told me what has happened. Beyond Aegon making a choice that had upset people…” You pressed and Helena fiddled with the rings on your fingers. She stared at the one that matched the one she wore before speaking in her careful way.  “Aegon. Feels a great amount of guilt. For what has happened between him and Rhaenyra. He sent a letter hoping for peace. Grandfather was furious but he… I think Aegon was right to do it. Rhaenyra found out about a plan… to kill one of us. It was planned before Lucaerys was found. Her people were able to interfere and Rhaenyra wrote back to Aegon to warn him.” Helena explained. You leaned in and let her lean her head against you. You were one of the few people that Helena allowed to embrace her something you were rather proud of.   “Is that why she came here?” You asked with a rapt focus. Helena sighed and shook her head.  “Aegon wishes to negotiate the issues with the throne that is between them. He told her this before anyone could stop him and Grandfather was furious.” Helena said and then suddenly stopped speaking.  “Where… is Otto?” You asked. Helena stayed silent and sat up. You waited for her to find the words but her eyes simply filled with tears and she shook her head. She had a habit of seeming to leave her own body until she felt better. You knew not to push any harder and fetch the pile of embroidery Helena had been working on.  The next few days were uncomfortable at best. Otto had vanished and Alicent tended to check in on you and Helena several times a day never explaining anything but fretting over you and then leaving. You hadn’t seen Aemond since the awkward breakfast and Aegon seemed to always be in the council room with his half-sister. What made everyone all the more nervous was the lack of explanation for Daemon and Caraxes’ absence.   There was however one joy that you had discovered. Jace and Baela. They were kind and always eager to greet you. You would walk arm in arm with them as you strolled the corridors which you did often when your rooms became too stifling or Helena had ‘a fit of upset’ as Alicent would call it and was sent away from her rooms.  Jace made a quick study of what you liked and your routine and Baela filled you in on all she knew from outside the Red Keep. The pair insisted that when they were crowned as Rhaenyra’s heirs you should visit them.  “Is… is Aegon not…” You had stuttered out. Jace smiled warmly as turned arm still linked with yours while Baela held your hand as you and Helena would.  “That is what he is talking to my mother about. Arrangements.” Jace said seriously but his eager smile never faltered so you found yourself smiling a little too.  “Otto won’t be happy.” You said and Baela scoffed swinging your hands a little as the group began its slow pace again.  “He has been imprisoned so I don’t think he’ll have a say.” Baela frowned at you when you let out a long huff.  “Is that where he has been?” You asked.  “Do they not tell you these things?” Jace asked and you shrugged.  “Aemond does.. usually but I do not know where he is at the moment. Alicent picks what she tells me she doesn’t like to scare me but usually Helena finds out anyway and tells me if Aemond doesn’t.” You explained nervously. Jace nodded and gestured to a seat towards a shaded part of the corridor. The three of you settled down and he began to fill you in on what had happened.    Baela began explaining what her grandmother had told her. As it transpired Aegon had a falling out with Otto and shortly after a threat against his children had been discovered. Rhaenyra wrote the same evening saying the same thing. Despite evidence and Rhaenys’ insistence that it was Daemon that had made the arrangements no one could entirely prove it and Ageon slowly convinced himself Otto was to blame. After she finished she let Jace finish. Aegon had summoned his half sister and insisted on a negotiation. He wanted the lives of his siblings mother his children himself and Helena’s friend. At this point Jace had paused and pointed out that Aegon had meant you. You found yourself a little flattered that your life might be valuable enough to beg for during a negotiation between two royals. He went on; explaining that Aemond had been sent to Dragonstone he and Vhagar were to help Corlys handle anyone who might rebel against Rhaenyra by sea and earn Rhaenyra’s forgiveness for almost killing her son and taking the life of Luke’s poor dragon.  “Does that mean the fisherman story is true?” You interrupted and looked at Jace curiously who smiled and nodded. “Oh! I must tell Helena we were so happy when we heard Luke was found. The story was so odd no one here in the Keep was sure if it was true or not.”  Jace seemed pleased that you and Helena had worried for Luke but said nothing more about that and continued to explain. Aegon would stay at King’s Landing until Rhaenyra could trust him and Helena could come and go between the Red Keep and Dragonstone as she wished.   “What about me… what about Lord Hightower? He was so kind to me. Is there not anything to be done?” You asked and Jace looked away. Baela rolled her eyes as if she thought Jace’s chivalrous inability to give bad news was ridiculous and answered instead.  “Rhaenyra gives little mind to where you go and what you do if you are going to support Aegon’s negotiation. As for Otto… She believes he is the reason her siblings turned on her and that her childhood friend turned on her. There is little anyone can do to mend that.” Baela explained. The three of you talked well into the afternoon. There had been so much that you hadn’t been told.   Finding yourself overwhelmed you excused yourself. Having intended to go to Helena instead you found yourself walking to your rooms as your mind whirled. Nothing felt safe now. Your stomach twisted and turned anxiously as you such in a shaky breath and let out a heavy huff of air that alleviated the pain of your anxiety for a moment before it rushed back in its horrid fluttering way. Making your way to your bed and lying down you thought over everything they had said. Perhaps you should take your leave and go back home. Though you had been at Helena’s side for so many years that the King’s Landing was home. Eventually the whirring of your mind exhausted you and along with the heat dragged you into an uneasy sleep. At one point you were conscious of Helena calling for you and your bed jostling.  When you woke you found a Small foot on your pillow next to you. Sitting up a little you realised that Helena was asleep on one side of your bed clutching your hand while cradling Jaehaera against her chest while Jaehaerys slept sprawled out and his feet on your pillow beside your head. You stared up at the ceiling listening to the early morning noises. Scurrying of servants the sound of birds and the city far below the keep. Jaehaerys woke up just enough to crawl around and tuck himself under your hand that was clutched in Helena’s and wrap his little arms around both of yours. He was back asleep before you could think to wish him a good morning. It was beginning to get warm when Alicent came to find you all. There was a moment of relief when she spotted everyone piled up and for a moment she looked as if she might join you.  “Helena was worried when she could not find you yesterday.” Alicent said quietly as she leaned on the side of your bed reaching over to stroke her grandchildren’s heads.  “I had much to think about.” You said quietly. Alicent nodded and blinked several times as if she was trying to hold back tears.  “We all do.” She said quietly. With your free hand you reached for Alicent’s. She squeezed your hand and sucked in a shaky breath before smiling at you and standing. “We need to prepare. Helena wishes to stay at Dragonstone while everything is settled here. I can arrange for you to return to your family.” Alicent smiled. Despite the warmth of it the smile didn’t reach her eyes and made her look rather hopeful and empty.  “Can Helena not come with me? To my family’s keep. It does seem only fair. I have spent so many years here.” You offered hopefully. Alicent let out an odd laugh as she untangled Jaehaerys from you and Helena and handed him off to a maid who stood by the door. It was cold and sharp unlike the warm sounds of the morning.   “If I had my way I would allow it.” She said somewhat bitterly. You looked at Helena. She was always rather ethereally peaceful. Gentle in an unnerving way. Looking at her now she looked worn and tired. Guilt rolled heavily in your belly as you considered going home and flinging yourself into the arms of your mother. Helena would never think to leave you behind. From what Jace and Baela had said even Aegon had included you in his negotiations. You let yourself think of your family for a moment before letting out a shaky sigh.  “Then I will go to Dragonstone. If it is not inconvenient.” You said firmly. Grief shrouded you as you spoke the words but when you held Alicent’s gaze you knew you had made the right choice. The dowager queen looked as if a great weight had lifted from her shoulders.  “I will not be able to go with her. I must stay with Aegon. I am grateful.” Alicent said hurriedly. She stumbled in the hem of her dress as she rounded the bed and crushed you into a hug.  “Aemond will be there too. I shall take care of her. My uncle has a keep in the Crownlands not too far from Dragonstone by ship. I will have my father write to him he should have no issue visiting.” You offered as comfort. Alicent gave a short smile before turning to Helena who frowned with an objection to being roused earlier than she was used to.  ******************  The journey to Dragonstone had been uncomfortable. After being packed up into a large ship and seen off by Aegon and Alicent a storm had struck the sky open. The short boat trip had been a sickly one with all aboard becoming queasy because of the violent rocking of the boat. Once you had arrived at Dragonstone there was no one to greet you.  “Where do we go?” You asked and Helena shook her head as she lifted her cloak to shelter the children under it from the rain. There was a sound overhead and looking up you could just make out the shape of Vhagar and a smaller dragon among the storm clouds.  “Aemond!” Helena said rather hopefully. Turning to the servants standing next to the boat you called out.  “Stay with the ship. We shall go to Aemond and have someone come to fetch our belongings.” You gestured to the docked boat. The group nodded and fled into the ship. Picking up a child each you and Helena hurried as fast as you could across the beach towards the dark shape of Vhagar circling in the air. The great beast landed and the heavy rain hid her from sight. The rain came down so heavily that it was quite a shock when Rhaena hurried into view from the murky darkness.  “Princess? Lady (Y/N)?” She said in surprise and hurried to guide you both towards a large cavern. Once inside you lowered your soaked hood and lowered Jaehaera to the floor holding her hand tightly as you were led into the keep. Guards stood ominously along the corridors. Rhaena continued until you were quite lost and stopped at a door.  “These will be your rooms.” She said to you and opened the door. When you didn’t enter she smiled and tried to look encouraging as she added. “Baela asked our grandmother to send some furniture a lord from the Reach once gifted her. She thought it might comfort you… that is where you are from?”  “Yes. It is. Though I have been Helena’s companion for some time now. Most of my life in fact… Thank you all the same.” You said when Rhaena looked a little disappointed. “I have been away so long that it shall be nice to have a reminder.” At this Rhaena beamed happily before continuing to show Helena where she and the children would stay.   “We are sorry that you had to walk up the beach by yourselves. The storm hit rather a lot harder than we thought it would. We… weren’t prepared.” Rhaena explained.  “We cannot fault you for the weather.” Helena said in her gently wise way and smiled at Rhaena who nodded and looked pleased.  “I shall leave you to settle and fetch someone to collect your things from the ship.” She said by way of dismissing herself and hurried off and shut the door to Helena’s rooms behind her.  “Well. Here we are.” Helena said as she sat in a comfortable-looking chair that was carved to look like a furious dragon.  Settling the children was far easier than you had thought. Jaehaera was happy to settle down in front of the fire and play with her toys while Jaehaerys was content going about the room and greeting each carved dragon that he could see. Everything had changed. You longed to go back to the keep or to go home to your parents but couldn’t bear the thought of leaving Helena.   “Perhaps Aemond will be able to see us.” You offered with a smile. Helena looked at the door thoughtfully and then nodded as if for now that hope would be enough to keep her satisfied.,2024-07-11 07:01:41 GMT

The courtiers and guards offered polite bows but there was a tension in the air a collective holding of breath as they awaited the inevitable.     Rhaenyra’s journey to King’s Landing had been fraught with hardship. Disguised as a Silent Sister she had sailed there on a small boat keeping her head bowed and her face veiled to avoid recognition. It was a desperate attempt to reach Alicent without attracting attention but in the end it was all for for nothing. Alicent had refused to listen her heart hardened by the lies she told of her father.     Aelyx stood at the entrance of the Great Hall her silver hair cascading over her shoulders like moonlight. Her expression was a mix of relief and irritation a storm building behind her violet eyes. As Rhaenyra approached the younger woman crossed her arms her posture rigid with restrained anger.     “Welcome back my love” Aelyx said her voice cool and clipped. “How was your… journey?”     Rhaenyra sighed brushing a strand of hair from her face. “It was as expected. Alicent would not listen. She is too entrenched in her father’s schemes.”     Aelyx’s lips pressed into a thin line. “And yet you wasted precious time and effort to see her when you knew the outcome.”     “I had to try” Rhaenyra replied her own temper flaring. “I had to make the effort for peace.”     “Peace? Or validation?” Aelyx’s words cut deep and Rhaenyra felt a stab of anger. “Clear the room” Aelyx commanded the onlookers her gaze never leaving Rhaenyra’s.     The courtiers quickly dispersed leaving the two women alone in the vast hall. The flickering torchlight cast long shadows on the stone walls adding to the sense of impending conflict. Before Rhaenyra could speak Jacaerys her eldest son stepped forward his face a mask of anger and disappointment.     “Mother” he began his voice tight with emotion. “Why did you go? Why did you leave us?”     Rhaenyra looked at her son guilt gnawing at her. “Jacaerys I had to try and prevent this war. I thought if I could speak to Alicent…”     “But you failed” Jacaerys interrupted his voice rising. “You left us vulnerable. Do you even realize how precarious our position is?”     Aelyx stepped forward placing a hand on Jacaerys’ shoulder. “Enough Jace. Let us handle this.”     Jacaerys glanced between his mother and Aelyx his jaw clenched. “Fine. But this is not over.” With that he turned and left the hall slamming the doors behind him.     “You think I did this for myself?” Rhaenyra’s voice was sharp her eyes narrowing. “You think I wanted to grovel before Alicent?”     Aelyx stepped closer her eyes blazing. “I think you wanted to prove something to yourself. That you could still sway her that you still had some control over this mess.”     “That is not fair” Rhaenyra shot back. “I am trying to avoid war to keep our family safe.”     “Our family?” Aelyx laughed bitterly. “Or your pride? You left me here to handle everything while you chased a fantasy. Do you even realize how important our position is?”     Rhaenyra’s face flushed with anger. “I did not leave you. I trusted you to manage things in my absence.”     “Manage things?” Aelyx’s voice rose echoing off the stone walls. “I am your wife not your steward. I have been fighting to keep our allies from fracturing dealing with traitors and spies while you were off on a fool’s errand.”     “I never asked you to do all that” Rhaenyra snapped.     “No you didn’t. Because you never think about anyone else” Aelyx retorted her voice breaking with frustration.     The two women stood in silence for a moment the weight of their words hanging between them. Rhaenyra’s anger began to fade replaced by a gnawing guilt.     “Aelyx” she began softly reaching out a hand but Aelyx stepped back avoiding her touch.     “I love you Rhaenyra. But you need to understand that you are not alone in this. We are supposed to be partners equals. You cannot just leave me behind and expect everything to be fine.”     Rhaenyra’s eyes softened her shoulders slumping in defeat. “I am sorry. I should have considered your feelings your position. You are right.”     Aelyx’s gaze softened slightly though the hurt was still evident. “We are stronger together. But only if we truly act as one.”     Rhaenyra nodded stepping closer. “I promise from now on we make decisions together. No more leaving you behind.”     Aelyx hesitated for a moment before taking Rhaenyra’s hand. “Good. Because we have a war to prepare for and we cannot afford to be divided.”     As they stood together hands clasped the tension began to ease. They both knew that the path ahead would be fraught with danger and challenges but at least they would face it together united as they were meant to be.,2024-07-11 08:02:53 GMT

Aegon and Helaena who were forced to get married even though they didn’t want to. And so on and so forth. Are they betraying this “Targaryen heritage”? Good for them.,2024-07-11 07:47:34 GMT

Many men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her in the first year of her marriage to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign. He had a man’s needs after all and they had spent that year apart Ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her father’s castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb the infant at her breast than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles. And if his seed quickened she expected he would see to the child’s needs.  He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him and called him “son” for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last and Catelyn rode to Winterfell Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence.  That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother not so much as a word but a castle has no secrets and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband’s soldiers.   — A Game of Thrones Catelyn II  Catelyn understands the social rules of the society she lives. She’s been taught the belief that men having affairs and fathering bastards is normal. But even in such a patriarchal society there has to be a level of respect afforded to the wives of the men that cheat (especially if they’re noblewomen from powerful families). In Catelyn’s case she feels slighted because her husband raised his bastard in the same household. It is considered a social insult to Catelyn that her husband did this to her.   She had come to love her husband with all her heart but she had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned’s sake so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight and as he grew he looked more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse.  — A Game of Thrones Catelyn II  Obviously it’s not fair to Jon that Catelyn takes out her resentment on him. Though from her POV chapters it’s shown that she holds no negativity towards Ned’s mystery mistress despite hating Jon. It’s impossible to hate someone you don’t even know. Meanwhile Jon is a living breathing reminder of her husband’s infidelity. While it would be a more reasonable reaction for her to dislike Ned rather than misdirect her negative feelings towards Jon Ned is still her lord husband. It is easier for Catelyn to hate Jon.  When it comes to Rhaenys her husband’s mistress and bastards are relatively unknown to her even if she is aware of their existence. They were kept far away from her. So Rhaenys is less likely to resent them. That’s why Rhaenys addresses only Corlys with barely concealed anger but Alyn doesn’t earn her scorn. The scene between her and Alyn in episode 4 appears to be the first time those two have ever interacted. Rhaenys has not had to live every day with the reminder of her husband’s betrayal. If it’s out of sight it can be (relatively) out of her mind.   I’m sure that the way this show characterizes its female characters as more gentler/calm individuals definitely plays a part with how Rhaenys reacts here too. Which is why the viewers are led to assume Rhaenys just quietly accepted the fact of her husband cheating on her.  In the book Corlys never dared have his bastards around whilst his wife still lived. He kept the affair so discreet that had it not been for him personally presenting the boys at the Red Sowing no one would have assumed him to be the father. Both Addam &amp; Alyn were staying with their mother and serving in her fleet. In the show Alyn is in Corlys’ fleet and therefore more likely to come under notice (and that’s exactly what happens).   Princess Rhaenys his wife had the fiery temperament of many Targaryens Mushroom says and would not have taken kindly to her lord husband fathering bastards on a girl half her age and a shipwright’s daughter besides. Therefore his lordship had prudently ended his “shipyard trysts” with Mouse after Alyn’s birth commanding her to keep her boys far from court. Only after the death of Princess Rhaenys did Lord Corlys at last feel able to bring his bastards safely forward.  — Fire &amp; Blood The Dying of the Dragons  Not only did Corlys have an affair with a young girl (coincidentally the same age Rhaenys was when she married him) but said girl is also a commoner. Rhaenys is a princess who could have been a queen. For Corlys to make his affair public would have been a huge insult to his wife even if he never brought up the matter of his bastards. Rhaenys would have been rightfully furious at the shame her husband’s actions bring upon her. She was the first to speak up when her position as heir was usurped so that suggests she’s not the type to just turn a blind eye to anything she considers an injustice against her. Book version has a far more fiery personality than her show counterpart. Her reaction to the truth would probably be different too.   A detail in episode 4 which I did like is when Rhaenys corrected Alyn about her title. Princess not Lady. She’s asserting her position and status in that moment. Alyn serves the Lord of Driftmark so naturally his Lord’s wife would be a Lady to him. By correcting Alyn Rhaenys places him in the position of an ignorant who does not even know the difference between the titles. Perhaps a subtle expression of classism towards another who is very much beneath her. But the glimmer of antagonism is gone as soon as it appears. Their interaction is not simply Rhaenys welcoming her husband’s bastard with open arms.   The show leaves Rhaenys’ original reaction when she first finds out about the affair to the imagination. So it’s difficult to say what exactly she felt in the moment. Unlike fiery tempered book!Rhaenys the show version is more calm and collected. She is a person who seeks peaceful resolutions to problems (similar to Catelyn) so her reaction in the show makes sense for her even if it’s different from how the book version of her may have reacted. In the HOTD canon we’re basically getting an interpretation of how Catelyn might’ve reacted to Jon had he been raised away from Winterfell.,2024-07-11 07:29:26 GMT

On the roleplay hunt again now with HOTD Season 2 in full swing!   If you’re new to my blog I’m 20 years old (He/They/It pronouns) and I have roughly 7+ years of writing experience - I’m usually a semi-adv literate writer who averages 3-4 paragraphs though I’ll often do my best to match the length of my partner’s reply. I enjoy chatting OOC about characters/dynamics and general plotting so please be aware of that and I also primarily use discord for roleplays though I’m also open to just using Tumblr DMs! I’d also be open to potential group roleplay servers though preferably nothing over the top and fancy (things with official Tumblr blogs for instance while I think they are very neat it’s just not my style with specific edit and fc requirements - I don’t want to spend my motivation on just setting up character information ya know?)  —-  In terms of knowledge I’m most familiar with the show but I’m in the process of reading Fire &amp; Blood and have some knowledge of the ASOIAF book lore due to research for one of my original characters.  For roleplay plots I’m open to canon based canon divergence &amp; AUs in general! I do have a preference for romantic based things as a heads up.  I will be honest I am a sucker for dragons if you couldn’t tell - so I would love some decent dragon involvement if possible since all the characters I wish to play are dragon riders/have the potential to be dragon riders.  For romantic plots I am exclusively looking for MxM pairings - For more general plots (Familial/Platonic) any pairing is fair game. I’m open to canon characters or OC related things while I have a preference for OCs I’m fine with either option alongside potential OCxCanon! The canon characters I’m open to writing and my main OCs are down at the bottom of the post!  I may consider doubling up - though it’s a case by case basis and dependent on the ideas. I generally prefer to put all my focus into one plot but considering the two sided nature of HOTD I’m more open to potentially doubling.  I’m open to canon typical themes here in terms of how ‘dark’ things are - I have few hard limits if I’m honest. Angst/darker plots are also welcome though I would like to have hurt/comfort in there somewhere at the least - I’m not the best with 100% angst all the time even if it’s all a massive tragedy in the end.  Additionally NSFW is also on the table - if it happens and we want to write/plan for it I’m totally down for it if not that is also completely okay!  —  Characters I’m Looking to Write  Note: I’m new to writing canon cast characters - so please be open to my interpretations as they may not be 100% accurate to either show or book canon.  —-  Canon Characters:  Laenor   Aegon II   Jaecarys/Jace   Lucerys/Luke   Daeron   Addam of Hull  —  Original Characters:  - The Dragon Thief || Carden Waters  “I think we all know how my coin landed so why shouldn’t I burn it all down? What else am I good for then?”  Carden is a ticking time bomb of a dragonseed the unfortunate spawn of Daemon Targaryen - he holds notable distain and hatred towards his half blood family for a multitude of reasons.

Gryfinn in truth is a quick witted and clever man who often has his own interests in mind due to how his mother and father lord over him despite being a man grown. He’s been holding off the inevitability of being married off by them for years now and he’s aware he may be running out of time - so he’s only seemed to grow more bitter towards most people minus the few closer to him.     - The Dragonskin || Olivar Pyke   “I think it’s because I’m like them in a way… Neither of us truly belong anywhere not anymore”   A skinchanger of Targaryen descent from the Iron Islands Olivar was born blind and has lived most of his life hidden behind walls - a secret to the world in more ways than just being a useless bastard. He shares a unique bond with a wild dragon called Shipbreaker though according to Olivar her name is Vethimax or that is her preferred name at the least. This bond is something more mutual than that of most skinchangers and their other forms. The dragon herself understands Olivar in a way and allows him to take control of her body from time to time allowing for this unique bond between them to develop - that and Olivar’s bastard lineage which also makes this possible. Though there’s more to this bond than even Olivar knows.  Olivar himself is a soft spoken and oddly calm individual he’s cautious and respectful around anyone regardless of who they are. He’s good at keeping aware of his surroundings despite his lack of sight but still struggles in many aspects due to having little education or instruction throughout his life.  —-  Note: I am also open to potentially making new OCs depending on the plots!

It is the only opportunity for Aeron to gaze upon Bellena Blackwood but time is running short as both hands are up for marriage. Aeron persistent to speak to her at least once takes his chance.  Warnings: none; mentioned drinking/some alcohol consumption  Authors Note: firstly ben = davos obvi. secondly I have read all three of the aeron fics on here and massive credit and thanks to these writers since NO ONE else is giving love to the ethereal prince that is ryan kopel. so i’m gonna throw my hand in the pot. also i haven’t posted a fic since the quotev days (iykyk) so please be gentle. reblogs/comments/writing advice all welcome!! hope you enjoy! (Bellena pronounced as Beh-Lay-Nuh or Buh-Leh-Nuh) (also… let’s just pretend the brackens did NOT poison the blackwood’s weirwood tree… vile rumors lmao)  Work Count: 4.3k  Lord Grover held a banquet and melee but once every three years a gathering and celebration of the Riverland constituents with invitation to the whole of the Realm though only mostly Rivermen partook. Aeron had been to five so far well technically six but the first as a babe so he did not recall much. This was to be his seventh.   Though Lord Grover was abed the last three occasions it did not stop his Lady wife and grandsire from continuing the tradition for which Aeron was grateful. It was the only time he was allowed to see her. To gaze upon her without the worry of being called a turncoat or worse.   Bellena Blackwood was his ancestral rival a younger sister to Aeron’s biggest competitor and the most beautiful girl in the Riverlands. Her thick long black hair and pale skin drew in many suitors from across the Realm even rich traders from Lannisport and Oldtown reaching out to extend their own hands but all were denied promptly.  Aeron’s Lord uncle talked of it constantly berating his own rival Lord Blackwood as foolish for not accepting any for the hand of his precious daughter. It only pleased Aeron each denial a certainty she would remain close even though it was across borderlines.   Every contest Lord Blackwood gave meant Aeron would have the chance to see her again but his hope was drawing thin as she grew older. Seventeen was still an acceptable marrying age in the Realm but a year or two more would begin to press the Blackwood’s luck as the whole of Westeros knew. Aeron was sure Bellena’s father would choose soon and it made him sick to his stomach at the thought. A distant lord taking her as his own bringing her far away from home and siring his lowly heirs on her.   He had tried to face reality; swearing the girl off in his mind after each sighting and repenting his thoughts to the Seven on his journey home afterwards. But another banquet would come and she would still be un-promised and he was right back where he was years prior. An endless loop that was starting to affect him now as letters began to arrive for his own hand. There’d only been a few which was why Aeron thought his uncle had not noticed just yet; most like assuming the worst of the lot was early and his nephew was right to dismiss them. He was half correct given that. His uncle trusted him as the heir to Stone Hedge and had graciously allowed Aeron the chance to choose his own Lady wife but Aeron could feel himself squandering it. It made him feel a-fool selfish even but he did not want the girls mentioned in these letters by their Lord fathers. He wanted her.   —-  They were late. Though Riverrun’s closest neighbors the Brackens arrived at the banquet to find many a coat of arms already waving claiming encampments on the Tully’s lush green. Aeron could hear his Lord uncle’s irritated muttering as they passed each trying to find an opening to pitch their own tents. At the sight of the Blackwood coat of arms a dead weirwood surrounded by ravens on a field of red his uncle spit the glob flying back to land at Aeron’s horse’s hooves.  “Even the bloody Blackwoods have already settled. We should have left when I said Aeron.” His uncle shot him a pointed look as they drew closer to their rival’s camp. Aeron could feel his cheeks redden with heat. He’d held up their departure trying on several sets of armor showcasing them in his looking glass to end up disgusted with each and how they fell upon his person. He had been knighted only recently and wanted to be presentable handsome even for the upcoming melee. He didn’t want to just look at Bellena this year; he wanted her to look upon him. He’d finally ended up choosing a set of silver steel with the Bracken horse risen off the metal on his chest the matching helmet extending a short tuff of horsehair off its backside.  As they finally passed the Blackwood encampment a tension fell as his uncle and the men accompanying them exchanged eyes with the men at arms guarding the tent. His uncle spit again towards these men before moving on.   Aeron had felt himself slowing on his horse now inching by as he tried to catch a glimpse of her through the open entrance using the opportunity as his uncle’s head was turned away. She wasn’t inside however none of the Blackwoods were. He could feel a frown forming on his face.   “Aeron!” He looked up to see his uncle twenty feet ahead turned with the rest of the company to stare back down to where Aeron had stopped. Aeron hadn’t realized he’d fully stilled to gawk at the encampment and his red face deepened with color. His uncle quirked his head as if to say ‘What are you doing?’   Aeron gave a quick nudge to the stallion below him and he rejoined the party issuing a quick apology unable to hide his embarrassment in his look. His uncle mistook it for other reasons however and Aeron almost breathed a sigh of relief as Lord Amos spoke.   He placed a hand upon his nephew’s shoulder shaking him lightheartedly.   “You’ll have time to butt heads with Samwell’s heir later we must set the tent first.” Aeron nodded quickly as Lord Amos gave him a small knowing smile his uncle himself having a life long feud with Raventree’s Lord. It fueled him as he thought it did Aeron so no suspicion was raised. Their party continued on for a few minutes more before finding a spot at the end of the camp’s alleyway and they began to set up their new home for the next week.   —-  “And though my grandsire cannot join us I hope this banquet enough to satisfy and remind us of our unity as Rivermen.” Aeron could feel himself falling asleep in the back of the hall his House’s late arrival attributing to the position of their seats closest to the entrance. He’d heard the same excusing speech the last three banquets the only thing changing the voice of Oscar Tully which had not yet deepened but was certainly not as high as the previous gathering. He could see the young heir look towards his Lady grandmother a Frey by birth asking for confirmation. She nodded at him a small proud smile on her lips. He turned back to his future vassals and raised a small fist in the air.   “Let the celebrations begin!” The hall erupted into applause Aeron joining them banging his cup with the rest and letting out a loud whistle. Food was served and cups refilled the conversation heavy in the air before Aeron grew the confidence to let his gaze begin searching the other tables. He spotted Mootons Hawicks and an abundance of Freys before his eyes found the red and black party. They sat two tables away fourteen men total jeering and rocking each other as they drank ate and laughed. She was easy to spot amongst the muck. Ben’s back was to Aeron so the Bracken let himself stare unworried of being caught.  She was seated next to her father opposite her brother sipping at her cup and watching the men of her house with a shy smile. This was one of the few outings she was allowed to attend so her behavior was controlled and docile; an expectation of her. She took a moment to glance around still sipping bouncing to the music that Riverrun’s ensemble performed. Aeron could feel his heart shudder almost choking on his drink hoping she’d look his way but also hoping she wouldn’t; whatever that could be conveyed as. It was embarrassing fawning over her like a lovesick knight in a story. He’d barely spoken two words to her his whole life not that the knights in the stories had any such luck either. She did not end up looking his way disappointing and relieving him all the same. He continued nursing his cup looking over the rim as he studied her.  Her hair was longer but she must’ve cut it sometime between the last banquet and now only a few inches added to its length. Wavy and thick it framed her face frizzing in the humidity of the hall’s activity. She wore red an exquisite dress with the shoulders cut out the fabric returning at her forearms with sleeves widened and flared to allow the free movement of her hands. A black cape with the Blackwood coat of arms laid pinned upon her shoulders cascading behind her and most like touching the floor. She was shorter than him after all and his own cape brushed the stone as he sat. He wondered how she would look in gold; if it would agree with her complexion or hinder it. Aeron felt his lips turn in and he chewed them thinking drink still in hand but no longer tended to. She looked so beautiful tonight a woman grown and he gazed on unnoticed. Or so he thought.   “Who are you looking at?” Aeron jumped at his squire’s words some of his wine spilling onto the table in front of him. Alfred one of the boys he’d taken on in his recent knighting had accompanied him and Lord Amos the anticipation of the incoming week’s melee providing need of him. He sat beside Aeron at the table leaning into him to look where the Bracken heir’s line of sight ended. Aeron remained silent looking at his squire struggle and unable to think of an excuse and for a moment he did think it the best course of action; pretending he hadn’t been caught watching the Blackwood girl. That was until the rest of his house’s party turned their attention towards him all eyebrows raised up in question.   Aeron tongue knotted itself tighter as they all began to look where his squire did even his Lord uncle. He could see their eyes drifting towards the Blackwoods settling on their rivals. A brief silence passed before his uncle started laughing cutting the tension and making Aeron flinch. All turned back with Lord Amos as he reached across the table grabbing Aeron’s wrist and shaking it good-heartedly.   “The melee will soon be upon us Aeron. You’ll have your chance with the boy.” Aeron nodded finally taking in breath for the one he was holding shocked at his stealth. He was so deftly obvious in his infatuation but he supposed the idea of him ogling over Lady Bellena was far-fetched in his uncle’s eyes; the idea of his nephew itching to maim the Blackwood heir the surer possibility. At least now he could look on uninterrupted referring to that as the sole reason for his persistent gape. As the conversation settled against his ears once more his eyes moved again to his rival’s table.   She was chatting with her brother now nodding and watching him slosh his drink Ben explaining a story in great detail an inaudible laugh escaping her every now and then. As she smiled at her kin Aeron felt his own lips rise with hers mimicking her reactions. He began to nurse his drink again as he watched the two converse.   —-  An hour or two passed and he’d managed to bring himself back to his own house’s banter a few times but his eyes always seemed to return to Bellena. Her presence alluring him away from his reality; this reality. Him being over here and her there not close by any means but making his gut flip-flop as if he stood next to her and could feel her warmth.  The sky had already darkened some men leaving the feast but most still present drunk and enjoying themselves. Bellena’s eyes had started drooping the hour previous the wine getting to her head most like. He could see her blushing cheeks from here red from the over-consumption.   Bellena stood up suddenly and on cue he also straightened his back almost rising with her. She exchanged a brief word with her company before turning walking towards the exit. Before she made more than a few paces Ben had jumped up almost falling from his drunken stupor lifting his cup towards her and saying something Aeron could not make out. It did not amuse Bellena who’s warm smile turned to a grimace of annoyance. She shot a quick word back at him before walking off leaving her brother swaying at the table. She departed passing but six feet away from Aeron on exit his eyes following her all the while. He turned his attention back to the Blackwood heir watching him fall back into his seat as the man beside him clapped his shoulder his Lord father speaking to him now face stern. This was Aeron’s chance. All he wanted was to speak with her; know her at least before she was given away. Dull this longing in his heart. She may very well disappoint him and set his mind straight; she a Blackwood and he a Bracken mortal enemies. Some part of him hoped she would not.   Aeron shot up in his seat nearly frightening his squire and startling his chatting party. All looks turned towards him as conversation ceased. He nearly stumbled over his words as they came.   “I’m quite fatigued. I think I may take my leave to bed now.” His uncle’s brows furrowed briefly before shrugging.   “You may do as you like Aeron. Sleep well.”   The discussion continued and Aeron stepped away from his seat but halted as he felt a body rise beside him. He turned to see Alfred lustily finishing his cup before bringing it down again to the table as he spoke.  “I’ll escort you Ser.”   Aeron’s next word slipped out hurriedly sounding pressed.   “No!” He glimpsed his uncle who still chatted away but the Lord’s eye was trained on his nephew brow furrowed again. Aeron drove on a feeble excuse pouring from his lips.   “No you stay Alfred. Enjoy yourself.” He reached out giving the squire’s shoulder a squeeze a tight smile upon his face.   Alfred’s eyes widened with shock briefly but his face quickly turned into a grin as he nodded.   “Whatever you say Ser.” He sat back down grabbing the wine pitcher and refilling his cup. Aeron turned back to the rest of his company giving them a curt nod before leaving his uncle’s gaze following him as he headed towards the exit.   Aeron shook off his nerves as soon as he entered the castle passageway breathing away his anxiety and calming his heartbeat. He’d done it again. Perhaps in a more curious nature than before but without assumption. His eyes trailed the hallway in all directions but he did not spot Bellena. Each path led back out the castle and onto the green that held the visiting houses so she could have gone either route. Aeron eyes drifted upwards silently praying to the Crone for wisdom to help him choose the right course. It was not a whisper in his ear but as he stood there he felt himself being pulled to the left; the urge in his mind badgering him onwards. Aeron thanked the Crone quietly and turned walking quickly down the passage.   He passed Riverrun’s inner gardens traveling by the Godswood on his way to the encampments. He halted abruptly though as he saw a figure standing in front of the weirwood tree. Although the urge to continue coursed through him he found himself drawing slowly towards and into the old grove.   As Aeron drew closer he’d realized he had found her after all for it was Bellena admiring the ancient tree. His heartbeat grew rapid his hands automatically reaching to dust his leathers and tunic though they were clean. He stood there for a moment just watching and admiring her the skin upon her face luminous as the moon shone on the parts he could see. Her hair was almost too dark to notice if not for its glint in the moonlight as well. She had her hands clasped in front of her staring at something on the weirwood he did not see nor notice.   They were alone here and Aeron seized the opportunity knowing this to be the only time they’d likely get to speak. Their first and last time to talk. As he stepped forward a crack echoed through the Godswood. He looked down only now noticing the dead branch in his path. He cursed himself inwardly. Fuck. He hadn’t wanted to scare her.   She was not frightened however not even turning to see who’d made the racket. Her voice was enticing heavenly even as it raised itself in annoyance.   “Ben leave me alone.” Aeron was not Ben however so he did not respond remaining where he stood unsure if he should say anything now. She was clearly irritated and he did not want to burden her further. He wondered if this had all been a mistake a rash decision of the heart that was ill-timed. Perhaps he’d have another chance throughout the week. Perhaps he should just leave. Before he could make up his mind and come to a decision Bellena had whipped her body around hair and dress flowing at the speed.   “I said to leave me alone!” Her nose was scrunched in anger malice all over her face. It drained at the realization it was not her brother. “Oh.” Her face turned into one of confusion as she stared at Aeron one dark eyebrow lifting. “It’s you.”   Aeron stood stock still. The accusation was not laced with much displeasure but she’d certainly seen the red stallion rearing upon his chest. That much was evident her gaze lingering on it as she examined him.  Aeron was tongue-tied. He’d spent years thinking of what to say how to start a conversation daydreaming of it most nights. All of those went swimmingly but reality was catching up to him quickly. She spoke again breaking the eerie silence for him.   “You are in the wrong sept Bracken.”   Aeron could feel his body almost breathe with relief. He had daydreamed something similar so he went along with the script almost instinctively forgetting all nervousness.  “Yet the old gods are not like to turn a weary man away.” She lifted her brow again.   “Weary of what?” He paused before finding his footing. He slowly made his way over before he came to settle but two feet from her. Respectful of the Lady but also making the conversation private.   “Of a Lady such as yourself walking alone back to camp. There are many drunkards roaming these grounds tonight.” The tiniest curve came to her lips before she pursed them looking back to the weirwood.   “No one will touch me I assure you. My brother would have the head of any man who dared to do so.”   Aeron studied her as she spoke raking over her face memorizing all its angles before glancing at her lips. She turned back to him chewing on them for all but a moment while waiting for his response. Red and plump their curve lifted higher as she noticed his silent gawk. He thought of Ben what he’d do if he saw them together and if he would have a go at his head. Aeron welcomed him to try.   “Is that all Bracken?” She tilted her head just so eyes going up and down slowly surveying his whole frame. He could feel his heart stutter in his chest. Was she toying with him?   It doubled his confidence instantaneously.   “Aeron.” The curve of her lips turned into a smirk her response swift.   “I know your name.”   Although it left him at a loss for words he felt his own lips turn up admiring her wit. A comfortable silence passed between them. Perhaps because he could hold some semblance of a conversation or just the fact that he was not nipping at her heels for a fight. This was probably the calmest discussion a Bracken and Blackwood had in well a thousand years. She turned back to the tree and he turned with her though he was not sure what to look for. She broke the quiet her voice soft.   “It’s dying.” Aeron looked closer before glancing at her.   “How do you know?” She shrugged lifting her hand to point at the weirwood’s ghostly eyes carved into the bark before setting it back down beside her.   “It’s stopped crying.” It was Aeron’s turn to raise his brow now. He took an even closer look leaning forward. She was right the blood that usually weeped from the tree’s gaze dry and beginning to peel. It looked to have stopped recently. Her next word was but a whisper.   “Pity.”   Aeron looked at her fully then watching her eyes scan the ancient relic sorrowful. He could feel himself fill with sympathy for her; the loss to her religion. The words came to him before his thoughts could conceive them.   “It is. I’m sorry.”   Bellena’s gaze drifted back to his offering him a slight smile now.   “It’s alright it was bound to happen eventually. Riverrun’s worshipped the Seven for a long while now. You have my gratitude though.” She nodded at him another brief smile gracing her lips. “I suppose the hour is late so I will wish you a good night and good luck in the upcoming melee.” She nodded again before she turned and started to walk off. Aeron’s eyes widened almost reaching his arm out to stop her withdrawing body but restraining himself. Watching her stride away he tried to think of something to continue their talk; anything. It came to him at once.   “The weirwood still bleeds at Stone Hedge.” She halted abruptly but did not turn back towards him. He stared at the dead tree stitched upon her back as he rambled. “It bled when I was a child and it still bleeds now. I don’t visit it often; it frightens me a little if I’m being honest.” She tilted her head back listening one eye on him. He continued “You may come see it if you like if-if you’d want to see it I mean.” He stammered over his last words realizing what he’d said and all the implications that came with it. A Blackwood visiting Stone Hedge; a most ludicrous jest. He didn’t want to seem as if he was mocking her he truly meant what he’d said. He cursed himself again. Idiot. He felt like hitting himself.   Before Aeron could process too focused on berating himself Bellena had turned and strolled back to him appearing but inches from him their chests almost touching. Aeron stood there eyes wide and body vibrating in anticipation. He hoped he’d not just ruined everything; hoped she didn’t slap him though he probably deserved it. Her voice still soft and calm as before reached his waiting ears.   “You have a living weirwood on Bracken land?” He only nodded as he couldn’t do much else his tongue stiff once more. “Where you’ve worshipped the Seven for gods know how long?” It was rhetorical almost offensive though he took no offense only nodding again. “And it still bleeds and blooms?” Another nod of his head.   Bellena narrowed her eyes pursing her lips once more and Aeron’s gaze fell right to them. They were so close that if he leaned forward he could kiss her easily but he would want her permission first. That was a necessity; he could never force himself upon her. He’d thought of it before and it only filled him with disgust. He much rather preferred his dreams of her wanting for him as well. His eyes drew back to hers as her voice came again.   “Hmm. Perhaps I should become Bracken then. The old gods do seem to favor the heretics.” His eyes widened further at the words both his brows rising not sure he’d heard her right. It took a moment for it to dawn on him but as her lips twisted into a smirk again he was sure of it. She was flirting with him. His heart pounded wildly as her gaze ran over him once more going from his eyes down to his boots and back. She continued before Aeron could stutter out a response.   “Sleep well Aeron.” She spun on her heels making for her final departure but Aeron’s hand sprang from his side before he could think grabbing her wrist delicately. Bellena glanced at his hold around her and then back up to his eyes her gaze suspicious and curious of his bold action. Aeron loosed his grip quickly dropping her wrist not wanting her to think him too brash. He had no idea what he was doing he just didn’t want her to leave but he knew he couldn’t keep her here against her will. He cleared his throat.  “Goodnight Bellena.” Her eyes softened almost immediately her lips turning up into another small smile as she reached for his hand now. She grasped it giving him a gentle squeeze as his mind raced. He thought his heart may burst from the contact the texture of her skin soft as silk the size of her hand so small and delicate as he looked downwards and watched it sit in his. It left suddenly her along with it. He could still feel the ghost of her touch as his gaze drifted back upwards watching her go hair bouncing as she walked off towards camp.,2024-07-11 07:14:12 GMT

Aemond would have been fine if they never found Aegon and he could ascend the throne Luke would never do that to Jace. the Greens are a family built on eggshells their bond has never been that close or strong. it’s always been Alicent or Otto that kept the leashes close but they were never really out of love. and it makes sense considering Alicent never wanted this she didn’t want to marry a man her father’s age and be maritally r*ped. there’s a scene where younger Alicent is bouncing one of her crying children at night and she looks so numb to it. she’s not sad she’s not angry she’s given up and it’s heartbreaking that this is the path her own father put her on. so there’s subtle resentment going backwards to Otto and forwards to her children even if she doesn’t realize it.      the Blacks however are presented like a real family. they have nicknames they smile they hug they get along essentially. Baela and Rhaena are excited about the joint betrothal to Jace and Luke and vice versa. they’re looking forward to it they grew up together and they like each other as people already. and you can feel the love that Rhaenyra has for her children all of her children. when she and Daemon hold hands in S1E08 when they laugh at dinner later in the episode— it’s effortless for them because they find happiness in each other. even before that when Rhaenyra was married to Laenor they had a friendship in their marriage they raised their children with love. he and Harwin Strong got along well. it was a very nice and stable dynamic between the three.      in the end it comes down to the fact that one woman got to build her family on her terms with lovers she liked and loved.   while the other was forced to build her family out of duty and sacrifice with a man that she was made to be with. their families reflected how their lives ended up going.   both were forced into their positions by the men in their lives who craved power and ambition and used these women like pieces in a game. even if they loved them even if they cared about them even if they were blood none of this would have happened had it not been for the men.     another example of the family dynamics:   in HOTD S1E08 the families are grown are we can see how they’d developed after years apart and it’s so interesting seeing the difference between the Greens and the Blacks.     the Greens are not aligned with each other they’re looking to other places or facing a different direction. they all have their eyes on something different. Aegon looking miserable he knows that their father would never get up and defend them the way he did for Rhaenyra. Aemond looking at Daemon almost assessing him remember that this is who the realm fear the most the best swordsman in Westeros. Helaena looking anywhere in general she might not even be looking at a person probably a wall to focus on as she disassociates. Otto looks at Rhaenyra he knows that the second that Viserys stepped into that throne room their side was moot. and Alicent looks to the floor passively in disappointment.      whereas the Blacks are huddled together in a more directional approach they’re keeping each other safe. Rhaenyra constantly holds Luke’s hand throughout this scene. they’re a unified front. they’re also all looking at Viserys the one who came in for his daughter for Rhaenyra and essentially for his grandson. remember he wasn’t walking to the throne he was walking to her. they’re grateful for it and they’re relieved when he names Luke the heir again. only Daemon’s eyes are off sometimes (and while this is a great foreshadowing possibility on how he was always going to break away from the family not the Blacks but the family) right now the reason he isn’t looking at his brother is because he’s looking at Aemond. they’re assessing each other and see the other as potential enemies or threats. Daemon’s eyes are off because he’s aiming to keep his family safe while Aemond is intrigued by the challenge.      i have to assume that part of the reason the Greens (Alicent Aegon and slightly Otto) look so disgruntled and insulted is because Viserys managed to work up the strength and walk to the throne for Rhaenyra. for his firstborn for the daughter he’s always kept safe. they’re seething on the inside the Greens have been next to Viserys for the last ten years when has he ever done something like that for them? it hurts to know that he will always consider Rhaenyra and her family first.   the Greens and Blacks family dynamic will never not be interesting to me. and now that they’re in a time of war so many things are turning their heads. Luke was killed and Daemon left after the fight with Rhaenyra the Blacks are starting to slowly come undone. meanwhile Aegon finds himself liking being king he was taking pride in his son trying to break the cycle since his own father barely acknowledged him. he loved him so much and while his death was tragic it ended up making him respect Helaena more and ended up having Helaena and Alicent bond slightly.  But when it came to Aegon’s grief Alicent could not offer her son comfort or companionship in shared suffering. Not the way Rhaenyra did with Jace. because ultimately Alicent has been hard conditioned this way she doesn’t know how to parent any other way she doesn’t know when to offer sympathies to her son and her relationship with him just keeps breaking. the Green’s wont last that long. they’re closer to the verge of collapse always have been. built on eggshells remember?,2024-07-11 09:31:16 GMT

397,House of the Dragon,['aemond targaryen x reader'  'bonniebird'],bonniebird,Dark!Aemond Targaryen x Fem!Reader  Masterpost  Make a request  Wattpad  AO3     Your hands shook as the flame lept to the paper and consumed it. Eyes watering as you pulled back and stared into the fire. The flames that danced over the small chunks of chopped wood did little to warm the cold hearth of Aemond’s room. The letter had been troubling at best.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Aemond had demanded that you write to your parents and have them swear fealty to Aegon. Instead of an oath of fealty they had replied with pleas to have you home and away from war. As their only child and heir they would pay whatever they had to to have you return. After a few attempts to find an excuse to return to your parents it quickly became clear that Aemond would never allow it that Alicent and Otto relied on you to make Aemond Malleable to what they wanted and that Aegon who cared little if you came or went would bend to the whims of his family so that even he was keeping you from going home.   It had been years since you’d been home. Over the years your parents visited but in truth you hadn’t been back to your family’s keep since you were young. As the king had grown sicker your parents decided to leave King’s Landing. They had begged you to return with them but you had been young and foolishly sure that you would be fine. You were beginning to wish that you had returned with them despite not being able to admit it to yourself. When you had been a child you’d been so excited to see the King’s family and the dragons. Your father had been weary when you asked to attend a name day celebration for Aegon. His tenth name day though in truth you were so excited about being allowed to attend that you couldn’t really recall how old he’d been.  You’d been young and excitable then and Aemond seemed to like you immediately. You both enjoyed reading and history both found yourself shyly on the outskirts of the royal family. It wasn’t hard for you to quickly bond with Aemond who appeared quite enamoured with you. Your mother encouraged your friendship he was a prince after all what better option could your parents find for their daughter? Though as he got older your mother began to encourage you to distance yourself. In your youthful arrogance you ignored the warnings until it was too late.  “My lady?” One of your maids said as she stopped at the door. You turned to her and smiled as you got to your feet.  “Has Aemond returned?” You asked quickly. She looked down at the floor and shook her head.  “No my lady. The dowager queen asks for you.” The girl said quickly. She was a new maid. One that was found to have no ties to Rhaenyra and the maids before Viserys passed. She was quite skittish but to your good fortune. Gullible.  “Send my apologies. I do not feel well. Ask her if it can wait till morning. I would not wish to make her or the queen sick at a time such as this.” You said quickly and threw in a dramatic sigh and a clutching of your belly for good measure. The maid nodded and curtsied clumsily as she hurried from the room. As soon as the door closed you darted around the room. Everyone would expect you to return to your rooms and rest so with quick hands you grabbed at the scattered gold coins that Aemond left tossed around on tables and chairs. Hiding the coins in the skirts of your dress while trying to look sickly you shuffled to your room. There were few guards and when you did pass one on patrol you gave a heavy cough and a sigh. It did the trick as the nervous-looking man eyed you dubiously and decided to rush past instead of stopping you. As soon as you reached your rooms you rushed to the wall beside your bed. Digging your fingertips into the wall you pulled at a large loose stone to reveal a small bag of supplies that you had been gathering. Some dried fruit and meat coin a map and a change of clothes. You quickly changed as best you could without the help of a maid and hurried to find your cloak. It was a dark heavy fabric and the hood fell over your face enough to obscure it but still allow you to see clearly. Looking in the large mirror opposite your bed you smiled. You barely recognised yourself. You looked like a peasant anyone from Fleabottom nameless and forgettable. You certainly didn’t look like a lady of the Reach who held the favour of one of the princes of the realm. With a deep breath you turned and grabbed at the bag before pushing between the mirror and the stone statue attached to the wall. Pushing against the wall a small opening slid into sight and you shoved yourself through making sure to shut the hidden door behind you. Your heart pounded in your chest as you made your way through the unlit corridors. As you moved about the walls of the Keep you could hear people talking to each other. It felt as if they might hear you and catch you at any second. The feeling of anxiety didn’t stop as you finally reached the last door. It was heavy the old wood cracked and complained as you heaved the door open enough to push through. Hurrying as fast as you could without calling attention to yourself you made your way down into the belly of the city. As you reached the city walls you spotted a man loading up a cart and arguing with someone a boy clambering into the cart was trying to help him. You recognised the banner attached to the cart. To your good fortune you wouldn’t have to trek your way home if he would take you.  “A wasted trip!” The man snapped. You smiled at the boy who spotted you and you dug into the coin purse you’d attached to your waist.  “Excuse me sir.”Your voice stopped the men from arguing and you rolled the coins in your hand so they made a tinkling scraping sound. The man’s eyes darted to your hand and his tongue flicked over his lips. “How far are you travelling?”  “Goldengrove. I go no further.” The man grunted. You opened your hand to reveal the small clutch of gold.  “Would this be enough for me to ride with you?” You asked and watched him carefully. The man took one of the coins and bit it. Then after a moment he nodded.  “Won’t be able to feed you.” He said back in the same gruff way.  “I have my own coin for that. Thank you.” You answered quickly and the man helped you onto the cart next to the boy who was sitting on a small bench-like chest that was attached to the wagon.  ***********************  Aemond swung his cloak off his shoulder and stopped. Looking around he inspected the room for your shape. Surely you had fallen asleep waiting for him to return on Vhagar and the candles had died down. You always waited for him to return. One of his mother’s maids came in with food and set it down on the table before turning to leave.  “Where is (Y/N)?” He asked and she paused.  “Lady (Y/N) was unwell. She was invited to eat with the Dowager queen but felt too ill to join her and decided to rest until morning. A maester has been asked to check on Lady (Y/N) in the morning.” The maid explained. Aemond nodded and waved a careless hand her way deciding that he would leave you until morning.   Aemond made sure to head to your rooms once he had eaten breakfast only to have Cole hurry to him and insist that Aemond follow him to the council room. When Aemond finally made his way to your chambers it was late in the afternoon. Panic stuck in his throat when he found your bed untouched. Storming from the room he hurried to find his mother.  “I have been to (Y/N)’s rooms.” Aemond said Alicent looked as if she were happy to have her talk with Otto interrupted and gave a slight smile as if little in the world still gave her joy but you were one of those things.  “Is she well? I have been unable to visit with her yet and the Maester has not been able to update me…” Alicent frowned when Aemond gave her a stern look.  “So she is not with you?” He barked out and turned. “What do you mean? She was unwell and went to bed.” Alicent insisted. Aemond ignored her but could hear the way she rushed after him.   “I will go and speak with the maester.” Otto said. He’d never liked you. You’d always been to fascinated with the realm one day having a queen with dragons and had admired wives of the conqueror far too much for his liking.  It was late evening when everyone gathered. Otto was first to put forward betrayal but Aemond wouldn’t hear of it. Alicent returned last having gone to the Sept hoping you were there. With both Alicent and Aemond convinced that you were loyal Aegon gave his blessing for the city to be searched. That night King’s Landing did not rest. Aemond’s wroth over an imagined thief taking his companion fuelled his fury. After two days of searching all Aemond could find was a man who swore that you paid gold to leave the city and a slip of paper burned in his fireplace with the words home in delicate writing. No one could stop Aemond from abandoning his post as the city’s protector and flying to the Reach.   ***************  With exhaustion you ate the last of your supplies. There was no enthusiasm at staving off your hunger and you found yourself grateful that you only had a few more miles to walk. The man with the cart had been as good as his word and taken you to Goldengrove. You expected him to turf you off his cart and go about his business but he and his boy seemed to have taken a shine to you as you travelled and he had sent the boy to a friend to see if they were travelling any nearer your family’s keep. To your good fortune he was and you were more than grateful to find that you would only have to walk half the night and through the day before you would reach home. You informed the man that he and his friend would be owed a favour by your father before climbing onto the second cart. You had to sit with several farm animals that eyed you dubiously as you squashed yourself into the back of the cart. But when the man had helped you down and pointed out a shortcut that would take you through the familiar village that belonged to your father you had felt a sense of relief. Suddenly the sky above you shook and echoed with a bone-chilling screech. Your first reaction was to duck down only to panic more when a strong gust began miles above your head. Through your panic the urge to dive off the dirt road you were following and out of sight among the trees took over. Once hidden among the trees you looked up and saw the great shadowed shape of Vhagar. Despite the fact that there was no way anyone could hear you over the furious beast your trembling hand pressed over your mouth to stifle a shaky tearful breath that ripped at your throat. It had been days. You were so close to home. Had he found you? Was he planning to land nearby and rip his way through the woods to find you? Your knees buckled and you collapsed down onto them with a grunt leaning against a tree which you gripped with your free arm as if it were the only thing in the world that could keep you steady. You didn’t know how long you stayed like that. But when you found yourself able to stand the sky was darkening and the sounds of the dragon had finally drifted away. It began to rain as you continued the last part of your journey. Half expecting to come upon your family’s land burned and ruined Aemond waiting for you to ply him with begging and tears. To your surprise no one seemed bothered by the dragon’s presence. Your cloak was pulled over your face so even the few familiar villagers that you passed by as you finally reached the village didn’t recognise you. Though you wondered if they would recognise you now. You’d been away so long. A group of villagers were carrying large bundles up to the keep and you found it easy to slip in among the group.  “Who knows what the Lord will do.” A voice cut through the crowd. You turned your attention to him and the heavily pregnant woman who carried a basket and hurried alongside him.  “I would be furious. If the royal house lost my child. How do you lose a girl in such a place.” The woman tutted and rested her hand on the swell of her belly.  “That prince did look rather fierce. Thinks she’s been stolen.” The man said back. You stopped listening then not wanting to hear anymore. Through the rain the great looming shape of your family’s keep came into view. Letting out a shaky sigh of relief you allowed yourself to look up at the beautiful building and take it in causing your cloak to fall back a little.  ******************  “I know she is here!” Aemond shouted. His hand slammed down on the table and the Lord’s wife glanced at her husband.  “I assure you. She is not here. If my daughter was in my own keep I would know it.” Your father said firmly. He was giving Aemond little information and it infuriated the prince to now end.  “Then where is she?” He demanded.  “We entrusted her to your mother’s care. She assured us that (Y/N) would be safe. If she is gone that is not our…” The words your mother spat out were cut off by Aemond whipping his attention to her and your father standing to hide your mother behind him to break the prince’s stare.  “Perhaps you should return to King’s Landing. She may have returned.” Your father said through gritted teeth. Aemond grumbled under his breath and stormed out of the hall. He jogged down the large steps that led to the entrance of the keep and shoved past a man carrying a load.  “Careful my prince!” A pregnant woman said. From the corner of Aemond’s eye he saw a hooded figure who had been looking up at the ugly old building snap their head towards him and then scramble to cover their face with their hood. Aemond glanced at them but saw only a familiar-looking peasant. As he walked away and the group headed inside he froze frowned as he poured over the reasons a peasant would be familiar and turned back to the keep. The doors were being shut as if to send a firm signal that he wasn’t wanted. Staring at the door he was more than certain that he knew exactly who the peasant was. He returned to Vhagar taking supplies from her saddle and setting up a makeshift camp among the thicker growth of trees near the keep.   He waited until the later hours of the evening before returning. Watching carefully he found a way into the keep thanks to a few careless men who had gathered outside near a side door that they left unlocked and unguarded. Aemond made quick work of finding his way through the keep. He was cautious and quick. Despite Vhagar still being nearby there was a lack of guards that made the journey easy.  ************  “I do not care what your father says. I am overjoyed to have you home.” Your mother said as you walked together to your room.   “He is right though. The way I left… he will have no choice but to side with Aegon.” You muttered and she sighed as you reached the door to your room. It gave you a heart-warming comfort. You had been so fond of the room before you left for King’s Landing. You hadn’t truly realised how much you had missed home.  “You cannot worry now. Besides You are your father’s heir. You will be the lady of this keep and no matter what you do he loves you.” Your mother said and gripped your hand. She smiled and kissed your temple before letting you retreat to your room. The maids you hadn’t seen since you were young had clearly been in the room. I had been carefully prepared for you. Someone had even fetched a bundle of your favourite flowers and set them in a vase. You felt a pang of guilt when you realised that you couldn’t recall all their names. They had laid out a nightgown as well as a bowl of warm water and a cloth for you. The large bed had been made for you and your aching body screamed at you to lay down for a moment. Before you changed or washed you did just that throwing yourself face down onto the soft bed and letting your body sink into the mattress as your eyes fell shut.   There was a prickling at the back of your neck that you couldn’t place. It tingled down your spine and you shivered a little as if trying to shake off the feeling. A heavy warm hand settled on your back as the mattress dipped causing your body to freeze up.  “Did you think I would not notice your absence?” Aemond said. He spoke in his gentle way that was a warning like an angry dog showing their teeth before they snapped. “You humiliated my family by running away as if we held you captive.”  Turning your head without getting up you slowly opened your eyes. Aemond wasn’t looking at you instead staring across the room as if he were uninterested. You took a deep shaky breath and pushed yourself up. The movement drew Aemond’s attention to you and his hand grabbed at your arm to stop you from pulling away.  “I… I had to come home.” You said slowly and avoided looking at Aemond.  “You ran! Because you and your family are traitors!” Aemond hissed out suddenly and yanked you towards him as he stood you put a hand out to slow yourself as you collided with him.   “I… I needed to come home and you would have never let me. You would have insisted that I stay.” You offered as an excuse. You couldn’t very well admit that your father wished to refuse to take a side and that if he were to pick one it wouldn’t be Aegon that he sided with.   “Because your father sides with Rhaenyra. You should stay with me!” Aemond raised his voice and there was a sound in the hall as if someone was rushing to the door and stopping just outside.  “I will not stand by and watch you all make war and I certainly will not be part of it.” You insisted and tried to pull yourself from his grip. It tightened his hand squeezing your arm painfully. There was a distant shout and rattling of people getting weapons out in the courtyard.   “You will return with me or I will burn this keep to the ground!” Aemond seethed. You had never seen him so angry before. At least this kind of rage had never been aimed at you. Shaking your head you felt tears well in your eyes as his fingers dug deeper into your arm.  “No! I am heir to this keep and… I must stay for my parents.” You insisted. Aemond looked at you coldly before letting you go taking a step back.   “Then you will burn with your family.” He spoke as if the years you spent together meant nothing. As if you hadn’t been his one and only friend for almost all of your lives. He left the room making it clear he had an escape plan as tears began to spill down your cheeks. Sitting on the side of your bed you took in a shaky breath and realised that when the King died everything had changed not just who was sitting the throne.  You told your mother what had happened the next morning. Neither of you dared tell your father who was fool enough to defend both of you against a dragon.   “What will you do?” Your mother asked as you sat together in the great hall of the keep. Before you could answer her your father entered the room looking worried holding a letter in one hand.  “I do not think I have a choice.” You answered with a slow sigh. She nodded and reached for your hand gripping it tightly. “Father?”  “I… I.” He stuttered and held the paper out for your mother. You swallowed a lump of anxiety that rose when you saw the green seal. “If we do not give you to him… He…”  “Will burn down the keep.” You finished for him. You watched your father sink down into his seat with a heavy groan.  “We do not have enough men to take up arms with those Daemon had summoned for Rhaenyra. Certainly we can’t hold our own against that great beast out there in our woods.” Your father admitted. He stared down at the table that had held the meals of generations of your family over the years and slowly closed his eyes as he realised how dire the situation was.  “Maybe going back with him will lessen his rage.” You said slowly. Your mother shook her head immediately and began to disagree but your father simply stared down at the table as if he hadn’t heard you.  “Say something!” Your mother begged when nothing she said could change your mind.  “Well! Without taking all of our people and fleeing to Dragonstone and begging for the queen’s mercy I can’t see what we can do! We can risk our lives all we like but we have people that need to be tended to.” Your father shouted back. It was rare for him to raise his voice and your mother looked as equally surprised as you felt.  “Our only child!” She said quietly and he stood from the table so abruptly that the chair fell back.  “You think I don’t know! You think this sits well with me? You think I would not change it if I could? He will be here shortly to hear our decision. We need to sneak out a message asking for help… perhaps if we go along with what he wants we will have a chance.” Your father said desperately. Your father walked around the table to your mother to embrace her. She fought him at first but fell into him as they held each other.  “That is what we will do then. I will go. You will flee to Dragonstone if you can.” You said quietly and looked down at your hands as you leaned back in your seat.  “(Y/N).” Your mother said in a quiet sob against your father who held her tightly.  “Will you send my things to King’s Landing? I… will try to send letters when I can.” You were trying to be brave and unwavering but your voice trembled as you stood and looked at your frightened parents. Almost throwing herself from your father’s arms your mother tangled herself around you and whispered comforts.  Your father gathered some of his most loyal men and instructed them of his plans while your mother clung onto you as if she thought she would never see you again despite insisting otherwise. All too soon the sound of Vhagar rumbled overhead like a dreadful thunderstorm shaking the ground as she landed.,2024-07-11 11:01:20 GMT

They have to bond someone with Valyrian blood.  Thanks to the blood magic that the Valyrian’s did they dragons are magically bound to only serve those of valyrian blood. The Dragonrider of Valyria specifically.  The Targs Velaryon’s and Celtigars are the last of the Freehold of Valyria. The Targaryens are the *last* dragonriders. Therefore they’re the only one who still have the bloodmagic.  Nettles was a dragonseed. She had Targaryens blood somewhere along the way. As did Addam and Alyn of Hull likely through their mother. The dragonseeds are called the dragonseeds because they come from Targaryens. Whether that’s an ancestors or a mother or father. There is targ blood in their veins. Because ALL other *Dragonlords* of Valyria are dead.  You have to have Targaryen blood to be a dragonrider in the world of Westeros.  The ONLY other time someone *may* be able to ride without Targaryen blood is a book-only canon of the horn that can bind dragons to one’s will.,2024-07-11 12:57:43 GMT

Warnings: mediæval like; canon divergence with the series; Y/N’s plot is loosely inspired in (TV Show’s) Helaena’s; drama; smut.  ***  &lt;!-- more --&gt; • (I)  You have dreams. What do you know about them? They come true that is what you understand. Whatever colours they are painted of they come true. Mostly they show you the past but every now and then… these dreams show something beyond your historical comprehension.  “Y/N my dearest” the queen calls you out bringing you back to reality. You raise your eyes and spot this red-haired woman dressed in fanciful green robes eyeing you with a maternal yet distant care. “There is something we must speak of.”  “What is it?” you remember your filial duties. Leaving aside your books you concentrate on what your often absent mother has to say.   “By any means I mean to bring to you a subject that makes me uncomfortable in speaking of” the Queen forces a smile but you can tell by the awkwardness in her eyes that she wishes to be elsewhere. “You are soon going to be married.”  “To Aegon” you observe resigned. “How could it be otherwise when he’s the heir?”  For someone so young your tongue can be sharp whilst your eyes give tons of liveliness not afore perceived by your mother. An awkward silence hangs in between the two of you.  “Yes to him. This will not happen soon though.”  “But from now on my lessons will change. I am aware.” And you smile to break the sudden tension. “Fear not mother. I think Aegon and I will be… in good terms.”  She doesn’t know how you can be certain but the Queen is relieved for delivering at last what she formerly thought to be dreadful news.  ***  • (II)  “Marriages are alliances that must not be focused in sentiments” instructs the Queen. “These must be placed aside for the sake of duty.”  “Is it not commendable to have some degree of affection between the parties?” asks Aegon somewhat confused with where this is going.  His mother gives him a look deprived of comprehension: how could she when she married his father by force never nurturing any affection for this man?  “Nay. The Church strongly discourages affection on both parts for otherwise marriage sacred in its end for the purpose of continuing the lineage becomes profaned.”   Aegon sighs heavily. It is worthless to discuss with his mother he knows it well. This is a matter that women are better familiar with for like his grandsire likes to say it is linked with a feminine world of which men have little doing in it.  According to the old Valyrian tradition the heir to the throne comes to understand that he’s to marry his younger sister Y/N. The young man closes his eyes at first not really excited about making you his wife.   “I shall do as my lady mother commands” says he in a mechanic tone eager to leave the meeting.   Must it be constantly uncomfortable every time they gather together?   A question the Queen sees unposed in her boy’s eyes. One of the kind she wishes she could answer but trapped in her own ambitious web all she does is eventually dismiss his presence of her.  And serve herself some wine naturally.  ***  • (III).  Aegon watches as you sit by the fountain. Years gone by since you and him grew up and were forced to marry. The union has been consumed but you have been avoiding each other’s presence ever since.  However for some inexplicable reason here he stands watching you absorbed in your usual reading. The book is black velvet with golden pages but judging by the content that has you frowning your eyebrows Aegon believes it not be of religious type.   He hesitates at first in how to come at you. There had seemed to be an unspoken agreement between both of you since that unfortunate day that once consumed the marriage would remain as void as possible.  Duties were performed of course. However ever since Prince Jaehaerys came to pass a victim of the Summer Fever neither could console the other properly. As a result Aegon produced bastards… but never a legitimate son to continue the line. Perhaps this was arranged albeit unconsciously so between him and you against Queen Alicent’s and your grandsire Lord Otto’s ambitions.  But now… Aegon cannot handle his demons alone. Out of his siblings you are the one whose nature somehow… does not mirror others or his own.  Sensing the weight of his stare you lift your gaze only to be caught off guard by your estranged husband’s presence. You quickly stand somewhat fearful he might be here just to scowl at you for failing your duties—something that you’ve seen in others’ eyes.   And even though you’ve been having odd dreams where Aegon and you get along overcoming these initial struggles that a forced match put you through you are somehow faithless in this. In addition to this there’s the fact neither speak to the other since your only son’s demise.  “I do not fault you for his… premature departure of this world” says Aegon not needing too much to disclosure the reason why there’s a distance between both parts under covered by a mutual distrust. “His suffering was short.”  “‘Tis part of our position to accept that what the Lord gives the Lord takes.” You muse thoughtfully.   Aegon glances away. Religiosity has never been his best even if he’s forced to play the pious.  “Ours however has been unnecessarily prolonged.”   The silver haired prince who wears court garments today looks like an empty vessel when these words reach his ears. You hope to reach out for him but…  “Pardon?”  So close yet so far.  You are dressing a cream silk gown with details in green and pearls. Aegon notices the result of the embroidery you’ve been working particularly focusing at the dragons that have been so perfectly woven in the cloth.  “I’ve only meant to say…” You sigh shaking your head as you quit. “Never mind. This battle is lost.”  Aegon scoffs at your behavior but in retrospective could you be the one to blame when he walked away so easily?   Biting down a bitter answer he looks down at his feet before saying:  “May we… walk around the gardens? I think we must speak.”  You cast him a long look.  Could this be?  But when this pair of lilac irises encounters yours mirroring each other’s soul deprived free will—for where hast it been put if not casted upon the creature done in the similitude of its Creator?—it as if the divine ire has been placated at last. As if little by little all is starting to settle.  Almost if there is hope.  “Aye lord. I do not see why not” and when you smile Aegon realizes this is no time to winter but to spring. “It has been too long since we last spoke.”  So too he smiles charmed by this woman whom he neglected by force of pride weakened in flesh and spirit as he knows.  “True.”  In his own way Aegon and you begin to gravitate towards each other. Thus the dragons dance.  ***  • (IV)  “There is a sadness behind your eyes I cannot decipher” Aegon muses.   You are lying on his lap. The two of you are found at the gardens in this cloud day. You like how he strokes your hair careful tender. A positive change in his manners in these weeks which you gladly welcome despite the early distrust.  “I think I might when I come to think about it but I fear to dig into it…” he proceeds. “It makes me want to demove it out of you.”  “That is kind of you but some people are born with it I guess” you close your eyes unsure where these waters are leading you to.   Though your dreams green they might be show you facts that come to be true you are still frightened by them. Some of them brought you to this very moment in spite of your reluctance to it.   Here you are though.   “I think we are rather creatures of it” says Aegon. “And I fear that I am one of the reasons why melancholy has found solace in your heart.”  You carefully rise and contemplate your husband. Your eyes scan his handsome features part of which mirrors yours. Lilac eyes and silver locks but a nose and a mouth that certainly take after your mother.   Pulled by strange strings that come from above you are reasoned by the certainty of being pawns of the gods. Regardless of never answering to them these never answer to your family either. The clash of mortality and immortality often results in misery.  “Pride is our fall” you muse able to see so many tragedies in the past that lead to this current one. “It is only equaled by selfishness. We are all doomed in the end. ‘Tis the nature of us all.”  “I often wish I was worthy of being loved made different by the divine” so much being brought out by words and yet you are drawn by them.  “No my dear lover; my sweet brother we are all capable of loving… and being loved” you tell him capturing his face with your hands.  You rest your forehead against his. Aegon closes his eyes swallowing the tears he’s been ashamed to keep when darkness rises.   “I am not. And I lament with the depths of my soul for it.”  “Shush now. Quiet the riots of your heart for we are neither too pure nor too profaned despite being creatures of sin. We can be light when there is darkness.”  “You are too pure for this world.”  Oh the anguish. The atonement behind words that hurt like knife so vicious is the pain these cause.   And yet your lips seek for his in attempt to mend it. Aegon is surprised by your pursuit but he doesn’t shy away. He welcomes gleefully the sweet taste of your lips.  For the first time in a very long time pain is left aside by another sentiment to both of you unknown. What is this? What is this if not the spark of joy? The start of something new where no words are sufficed to translate.  “I want you” he whispers like a pained lover realizing a little too late how his prideful heart and doomed soul stole him away from you for too long.  Whilst his tongue mixes with yours you succumb to the power of gravity. Like the planets attracted to the sun so is your heart to his. And you want to steal his misery you want to be desired as much as you want to love this man.  Half of your soul your other half.  “I am yours Aegon” you bite down his lips letting him have his way to you when lying down the grass and pulling him over you. “Reclaim me I beg of you.”  “I shall do as my damsel commands me to” he gasps breathless.  Where there was cold there is now fire. Two dragons two sides of the same coin about to get burnt.   He kisses you hard famine for your affection desperate to reach out for you and you lift your legs to tie him in between all the whilst returning his fierce kiss hands gripping his hair making a mess with his silver locks.  And then…. His lips comes to your neck biting and leaving bruises pleased to hear small sounds out of your mouth.   His eager hands start to work on your gown unlacing it eagerly digging his hands possessively against your back very clear in his selfish gesture.  “Mine mine lady” Aegon whispers against your chest pausing breathlessly to contemplate the mess you are now.  Your eyes are partially closed; your red-ish lips are open in a small “o” wanting for more releasing these desires for so long repressed for years repented as wrongs that should be cleansed of your soul.  “Mine lord” you sigh in content.  And looking down at his face you see a smile crawling over his lips which rises to his eyes. Your heart melts and you smile too.  “I exhort you to give me a precious gift” and you lift him so you steal a kiss out of his lips. “Your heart your soul… I cannot sleep well at night knowing my lover is not well. Let me be your healer as Venus healed Ares when he was in his worst. For I’d go to hell and cross through damnation to save you.”  “Lady profess naught these words I forbid you” and he kisses you in turn. “Unworthy I am of this gesture this affection! I shall guard however your heart as the great treasure to me sent by the divine. Sinful and doomed I may be…”  “I will redeem you if you let me.”  You shush his uneasiness with another kiss. Now you lay him down taking control of the reins. You reclaim him like he did to you except the dragon fire makes you bolder this time.  So your kisses do not concern his lips alone: your hungry mouth captures his neck and his chest… all the whilst you unlace his pants. Starving for affection one needs the other; a need released after being repressed under the guise of good behavior and social rules.  Oh but where’s the etiquette when your hand grips his manhood taking it the way he likes—oh you still remember your first night together when even under the effect of alcohol he was excited to teach you the way it’s done.  Bearing this recollection in minds Aegon throws his head back and lets out a loud groan.  “Heavens! Oh my lady! Never before so fair my leof!”  His chest growing heavy Aegon’s body is instantly warmed with fire. Eyes rolling in the back of his mind he’s about to come undone but not wasting his seed he turns tables and soon you are no longer the hunter but the prey.  That in finding pleasure you are able to bury scars of cloud days formed through pain is to delight yourself in these marital activities you and Aegon prevented each of the other in the past years.  Now he’s sliding his manhood into your core after locking your hands above your head you comprehend at long last what these dreams are about.  Your promise prince. The hope of a yet to come spring.  ‘Tis the way upon which salvation is craved: when hearts are blended and bodies are intertwined when parted souls are one united.  ***  • (V)   Politics are not the world you were educated to be part of which is something you are content about. Unlike your mother the former queen. This is not a field where you intend to seed your ambitions.  To many you are content with the role delegated to you and this isn’t completely untrue. But there are times where nights are dark…  …and full of terrors.  “Aegon” you whisper his name but he doesn’t respond; his snore tells how asleep he is. You sigh but you don’t call him again.  Untangling of his arm you roll out of bed anxious. Another dream comes to take your peace… something no one knows no one’s understand.  You walk barefoot towards the window and there you stand watching through the glass the darkness above. You can still hear the screams in the back of your head accusations the sound of blades…  War is coming.  What is there to stop it? The ambitions of the men are seed to the inevitable. Even so the scenes are hard to unsee.  Lost in your world you miss Aegon’s groaning when noticing the cold you left your side of bed and not much time after coming for you.  “Y/N” your husband snakes his arms around you waist resting his head on your shoulder. “You look pale. Are you unwell?”  You chew your bottom lip a sign of distress that Aegon’s familiar with. He suddenly recalls the reason why you and him were never close throughout your childhood and subsequent early adulthood: the fact you were always stuck in your own world.  A reason there was to it but he was afraid to figure it out then.   “What bothers you my sweet?”  As you slowly turn at him Aegon spots tears forming in your eyes.  “You’d not understand.”  “Try me.”  You hesitate fearful of losing him. As if he could read your thoughts Aegon cups your face and rests his forehead against yours.  “I shall not leave your side regardless of what it is that daunts you so.”  “You may call me witch for what I am about to tell you…”  The king chuckles.   “Hardly.”  He waits aware that this is where you open yourself to him. Aegon can tell by the looks you cast him how important this is a test of trust that will rely on his reactions.   Eventually though with little need to reassure you that whatever that comes out he will not leave your side Aegon holds your hands firmly and says:  “We have been under neglect for so long. We were not taught affection nor approval or any of the values our mother praises in public. And yet here we are with the crown over our heads.” He kisses your cheek there staying for a while. “We cannot be faulted for the sins of our parents my wife. We are of the same blood but we are more than that.”  It is only then you finally grant him entrance to a world where none had dared to do so. Aegon is thus told that you have inherited an ability few possessed in the Targaryen dynasty: the one of having green dreams.  Even so… here it is where one estranged couple gets intimate in the most blessed of forms: by trusting each other and overcoming former difficulties.   Indeed a victory to the Cupid… or the Virgin Mother who brought harmony to two troubled souls.  ***  • Epilogue.  War eventually makes its way to the realm. But when it does all is settled.  “I must lead my troops against this pretender to the throne” says Aegon in reference to their sister Rhaenyra who never entirely accepted to be cast aside in favour of her younger brother.  “Be mindful. She has Lord Daemon by her side” you advise him.  “But we have Aemond by ours” Aegon smirks at you.  As you two embrace Aegon places a kiss on top of your forehead and a hand over your growing belly.  “Beware my love” says he and you detect concern behind his eyes.   But you sweep away his concerns when you smile the brightest.  “No need to worry. You shall come back to my arms and I will perform my duty accordingly. Dare I say that more children will come in due time!”  Aegon chuckles quietly. When he smiles no beautiful sight could have warmed your heart like this.  “Aphrodite blessed me indeed!”  He takes your hand to his lips before leading you both to the court where he expects to part with his men soon. Aemond soon comes joined by Lady Alys his wife.  Even though this is an unusual union for the time where low born are hardly married into high born houses you and her got along just fine… and she’s been a good help with the dreams you have.  “This shall not be a farewell!” says Aegon before all in a ceremony that you are the protagonist of it. Oh courtly nonsenses you know but here are the perks of being queen. “For the divine calls me to take in arms with the one who as the same blood of ours has been conspiring with violence and never befriending with peace!”  “The Fortune has set the path to you my king. Be merciful I ask.”  Aegon nods his head regally every inch a king.  “I will keep your request in mind my damsel!”  And to prevent a civil war he goes mounted in his golden horse whom he calls Sunfyre.  ***  However women are not prevented to fight their own wars even if their victories in childbed are not sang nor praised by poets and bards.   Surrounded with the women of your trust you are now closed to a feminine world where men take no part. Curious to notice that where Aegon fights for the survival of his dynasty you too take a similar part in delivering its success.  Amidst pain and blood though you perform your duties accordingly. Most would applaud your bravery in facing the process with no tears and few screams.   I am as Targaryen as any of them.  A pair of twins comes to breathe the air after the process is done. You opt to name the male after your husband Aegon and the female after Rhaenys. It is only fair since you come after their line.   “How is my queen doing?” Lady Alys asks you once the labour comes to an end and the babies are taken to be cleaned.  “Good” you smile at her taking the hand offered and giving a slight squeeze. “Thank you.”  “More will come” she whispers.  Your smile spreads fully.  “Oh indeed. A victory granted by the Divine.”  “Even if the Targaryens answer to no men nor Gods” says Alys.  Both of you chuckle.  “It is what it is” you give your motto to your sister in law.  Towards the end of the reign of Aegon the Wise the chronicler writes how you successfully known as the peacemaker set the path to other queen consorts in your queenship. Popular throughout the Seven Kingdoms your hand extended where your husband’s could not.  For example you helped arranging the marriages of your third child Rhaella with Rhaenyra’s son Jacaerys as well as your fourth Hughes with Visenya. That way you brought Rhaenyra closer to your family instead of instigating another possibly revolt. Such matches pleased her.  It all ended well.  As for you and Aegon no successful match has been seen since King Viserys wedded Lady Aemma.   You and him found solace in each other and would remain so until the end of your days. There’s a saying in King Aegon III’s reigns that you and your husband’s bond was so strong that both of you were found dead sleeping in each other’s arms in an advanced age.,2024-07-11 12:54:53 GMT

WC: 4517  summary: when the world turned their back on him she didn’t.  &lt;!-- more --&gt;Don’t know what I wanted I have a memory  Throughout Aemond’s life he remembers how much he wanted to be seen.   By his father  by his mother  by his brother  by the whole world.  He wasn’t the heir to the throne he didn’t have a dragon like his brothers or sister. He was weak and nothing. He spend his days being teased and bullied relentlessly by his brother and nephews. They had venomous tongues and big sharp teeth. He hated the way he is.  But when the world turned their back on him one person remained.   She was a Tyrell born not long after his mother gave birth to his youngest brother Daeron. His grandsire and mother are close to her parents since the Tyrells and Hightowers are two houses that are closely related.   When he first met her back in oldtown he saw her as a meek and shy young girl. He hated it. Because it reminded him of himself. But his hatred grew when he saw how well she gets along with Aegon Daeron even Helaena. Maybe he doesn’t hate her maybe he just hates how he’s nothing like her.   Likeable.   Then it all changed in one summer evening.   He was reading at the great library of oldtown away from the world as he read about his great ancestors of old valyria and dragons. Dragons he longed to have. Like Aegon with sunfyre Helaena with Dreamfyre even Daeron with Tessarion. Then he heard a thud.   Looking back from his seat he saw no one was in the empty library but him.   When he returned to his book he heard another thud.   Shutting the book with frustration he began to look for the source of the sound that disturbed his peace. Walking deeper between old tall shelves he took a turn to the left and saw…her.  Younger and smaller than him but the Tyrell girl grunts as she climbs the bookshelf. Strong but mighty. The way her silly tongue sticks out as she’s so persistent to reach a book at the tallest shelf. He cleared his throat as he looked down noticing many books had been scattered around the floor for her to climb.  She turned to him with a surprise stare.  “Prince Aemond!”   As a child she squeaks like a squirrel  Aemond thought to himself.  “What are you doing up there?” Aemond asks curiously. “I..I’ve been trying to reach that book!” She says as she still tries to reach the book at the highest shelf.   “You will hurt yourself” Young Aemond sighs.   “Can you help me my prince?” she asks as she jumps down from the shelf.   “No-“  “Please!”  “Absolutely not-“  “You’re far much taller than me!” She says pointing at his height.   Even as children he has always been taller than her.   Aemond sighs knowing what he’s about to do.   And he did it.   Not for his own pride but for her.  “Oh thank you!” She thanked him with a smile when he easily reached and took the book she’s looking for. The girl hugged the huge book in her arms. “It wasn’t a big deal whatever” Aemond says acting nonchalant while he dusts off his clothes. “It is though I wouldn’t have been able to reach that book if you weren’t here!” She says with a bright smile.  Heat rose up to his cheeks. No one ever ‘relied’ on him before.   “Biarvose” he muttered under his breath not wanting her to know. But she heard him and tilted her head with curiosity. “Are you speaking high valyrian? It sounds lovely! Can you teach me?!” She asks cheerfully.  “What no I’m not-“  “Please! I want to at least learn something new!” The girl says excitedly. Before he could answer she grabbed his arm and dragged him to their seats in front of the fireplace. “I’m a fast learner I promise!” She says as she sits down beside him with a smile.  Can’t believe he’s doing this.  But…it felt nice. The way she wanted him to teach her. She could’ve asked Aegon or Daeron…yet she chose him.   “It’s…”  He mentioned her name. He liked how her name rolled off his tongue.  “…Tyrell right?”  She nods.   And since that day and for the whole summer he taught her high valyrian in the library. Word by word he was patient to teach her. He hates to admit it but she actually was a fast learner.   She was his first true friend.  She was the first person who makes him feel like he has a purpose in life.   Until they took his eye.  Just a year after he knew her by the time he turned 10 he had claimed Vhagar the largest and oldest dragon in Westeros. But for a price which was his eye.  He became the same boy who hated the world.   Never came back to oldtown or any places except the red keep. Afraid what the world might say about him. How ugly he looked with his scar one of his eye missing but most of all he was afraid of what SHE might say about him. Afraid of rejection how she’ll stop spending time with him.  His thoughts were interrupted when his mother came inside his chambers. Bringing in the young Tyrell.   “Aemond she’s here to see you” Alicent says in a slight pleading tone. For he has shut himself out from the world when the maester stitched him. It hurts and it will hurt even more if he knew that all that people will see in him was a monster.   “Go away” he says coldly his chair facing away from the door.  “Are you feeling any better?” Her sweet gentle voice asks as Alicent has her arm around the little girl.  Sometimes he just wants to run and hug her for comfort. For she was his escape from this cruel world. Her optimism makes him alive. He didn’t want to lose that.  “I said go away” his hands gripped the arms of the chair.  “I brought you-”  “I SAID GO AWAY!” He shrieks stepping down from his chair and throwing his cup at her direction as he turns around accidentally showing her his scar. His true self.  Alicent quickly tried to shield the young girl as she screamed. Shielding her from him.  From him.  “Aemond!” Alicent scolded her son.   Yet his mother’s scolding didn’t matter to him. He saw his friend’s…his only friend terrified expression. He scared her. He hurt her. Just like how the world hurt him.  He took a step back.   “I…I’m sorry” he says lowly before returning to his chair.  He wanted to cry. But it hurts if he does.  Then he heard slow and tiny footsteps.  And she…she placed a toy dragon at the table. As her hands tremble.   “I carved Vhagar for you…father taught me how to carve.”  The young girl says bravely. Yet Aemond wasn’t brave enough to meet her eyes. Not after he hurt her. So he says nothing.   “Get well soon my prince” she curtsied and hurriedly returned to the Queen. Leaving him alone in his cold and empty room. Only the sound of crackling fire filled the room. Aemond loved silence but this time…he hated it.   So he reached out taking the wooden figure of his dragon into his hands. And by the time Queen Alicent returned to his chambers she found her son asleep in his chair.  Holding the little dragon in his hands close to his chest.  -  Back at that party I was all over her  The death of Prince Lucerys Velaryon was at his fault and he couldn’t deny it any more.   Kinslayer. Thats what they call him now.  His betrothal to one of Borris Baratheon’s daughter came to an end once Vhagar snapped her sharp teeth onto Vermax’s body. No one wanted to marry a Kinslayer.  A crippled and a kinslayer.   What a fucking combo.   But he firmly believed that everything that has happened to him was meant to be. Because if it weren’t for it he wouldn’t be shaped as he is now. And he has to be better. Every sword training every lessons and at every war..he must be the best.  But that little boy inside of him still clings onto him till this very day.  Especially when his mother mentioned her name.  For he shall now marry her to strengthen the allieagance between their house and the Tyrells. They needed this. And he shall do it for them.   He convinced himself it wasn’t personal and he doesn’t wish to meet her and just arrange the marriage ceremony. Secretly afraid for what she’ll think of him now.  A kinslayer a cripple…a monster.  For they have not met again since that very night in his chambers.   And when he saw her gain at the grand sept for their wedding may the gods help him.   She has grown into a woman. Not a young child anymore.   She smiled to her family giving them a nervous thin smile.   Does he makes her nervous?  Does he scare her?  The ceremony was done in the sept. Not a grand wedding like any royal ceremony would be for they are at war and it’s ignorant if they host a grand wedding in the midst at war.  He couldn’t help but to stare how different she is now. How reserved and mature her body language is as she gracefully walks around with her long dress dragging through the cold stones of the sept. She was…beautiful.  “My prince” she says as she curtsied. Even her voice has changed. Now it felt as if honey were dripping down her tongue.  “My Lady” he greets back stoically. Not wanting her or anyone to read his mind.   “How are you my prince?” she whispers as the ceremony begins. Still making small talk as always yet he yearns for it. He’s deeply grateful that she still wants to talk to him. Yet it has been awhile since he properly talked to her it made him nervous. “I am well” he whispers back. His healthy eye looked into hers as they were pronounced husband and wife. He finds nothing but nostalgia in her eyes. She is just how he remembered her.  -  We didn’t make out or do anything  I just remember I was lonely  He didn’t like the idea of a bedding ceremony.  Where people would see him…and her.  It’s unnatural…and unfitting.   So he ordered for the bedding ceremony not to be done. But he promised that he shall take her that night and they can inspect the bedsheets in the morning.  When he stepped into her chambers he found her anxiously standing beside the bed. A weird tense atmosphere swept the room.   “I..” she wants to speak.  “I would like to say thank you for…not letting the bedding ceremony to happen-“  What is this? Does she not want everyone to see us together?  His anxious mind and overthinking took power over him.  “Who said it was done for you?” He snapped at her as he closed the door.   Shit. He did it again.  And she was quiet once more.  I scared her again.  “But…still…I still want to thank you…my pr-“  “Husband” he sternly says walking past her.  “Pardon?”   He took a jug filled with wine and poured it onto his empty cup. He at least needed a cup of wine if he wanted to bed her right.  “I am your husband now am I not?” He asks not looking at her.   “Oh yes…husband” she says with a nod fiddling her skirt.  Aemond turned around and took off his attire and was left with his tunic yet she just stood there beside the bed not being able to move.   She was nervous.  He looked at her unsure what he should do. Should he comfort her? Should he take her quickly so they didn’t have to endure this pain together? No- no no no he didn’t want to hurt her.  Then he saw her slowly opening her nightgown. Her hands trembling like when he hurt her as a child. She slips her nightgown over his chest-.  It’s been awhile since he saw a woman’s body.  The last time was…..was…  “Stop.”  She curiously looked up to him only halfway through from being naked. “I-is there something wrong?-.”  “No” he quickly answered looking down with shame.  Yes. There is something wrong.  When Aegon took him to that brothel…at the age of 13..he…he couldn’t- it scarred him.   She’s not like them. She’s not like that whore.  It’s only her it’s just her!  His mind battling inside his head as he stood at the other side of the bed. He blamed Aegon for ruining something that should be meaningful for a man and woman. Ruining something that should’ve been meaningful for him and her. He blamed the brothel he blamed his brother and foremost he blamed himself.   He can’t bed her.  Not like this.  “We must…do our duty” he says trying to mask his insecurity and vulnerability in front of her. Trying to mask the same 13 year old boy who was terrified when he stepped into the brothel for the first time.   He didn’t dare to look up. He didn’t want to see her being disgusted by hi-  “Yet you don’t want to” her voice was gentle and kind. Not a hint of mockery at sight.   “I-“  “I don’t want to do this either.”  He looks up finding her shielding her chest with her nightgown. That sight aroused him terribly. He wanted to touch her wanted to make her happy and satisfied. He wanted to make her smile. Yet he saw the same little girl that admired him as a child. He didn’t want to fuck her he wanted to make love with her.   But he didn’t know how to.  So he just…stood there. The two of them stood there and said nothing.   Just as he thought all hope was lost she puts on her nightgown and stepped away from the bed.   She’s leaving.  She’s disgusted by me.  “What are you-.”  She took a butter knife and roughly slits her palm letting blood drip to the bed.   He stared at her.  “There. They’ll think I lost my maidenhead” she says with a little smile plastered on her face. “No one will know.”  His eye drifts into her still bleeding palm. He groaned walking towards her ripping a cloth and wrapped her bleeding palm with it. “Mittys” he muttered under his breath. She chuckles “You haven’t taught me that word yet.”   And for the first time in a lifetime a genuine amused smirk was plastered across his face. “Stay still” he ordered tightening the cloth on her palm.   When he was done she gazed up at him for a moment. “How long has it been?” She suddenly asked. “I have not been counting” Aemond replied still holding her scarred hand. She slowly then pulled him to bed sitting down. “You must stay for awhile. Or else they’d be suspicious.”   Gods be good.  She was too kind for him.   And he joined her laying on the bed side by side. He wonders if she’s still afraid of him as their hands brushed against each other. He never realized how much he craved for her touch. Wondering what it feels like to be held by her. Would she be gentle? Or would she push him away?   “Usōven” he muttered looking at her. Apologizing for that night.  She turned her head to look at him. And smiled.  “I forgive you.”  -  I guess I am always it’s not a problem  It’s just something I got used to it  It got worse.  His yearning for her.  He was afraid to touch her for he did not want to touch her like a whore. She was his equal. He didn’t want to hurt her.  So he lets all of his frustration to Madame Sylvie. He was attached to her even before his wife returned to his life yet her presence made him worse. With the war…and his guilt for the death of Lucerys…and now the presence of her…it frustrates him. Every single time he fucks that whore he thinks of her. He imagined that it was her in bed.  Imagined that it was her holding him.  At Least he could keep her safe from him.  He didn’t mean for it to happen. He never meant for it to happen in the first place.  But when he returned from his sins back to his sacred sanctuary he finds nothing but horror in the keep.  They murdered his nephew.   Prince Jaehaerys.   A son for a son.  It was his fault his nephews were dead.   It was supposed to be him who’s dead. Whose head should be beheaded. Not his nephew. Not anyone.   After inspecting his chambers he rushed to his wife’s room. Finding her in bed holding Helaena and Jaehaera as the three girls cried. He saw how terrified the three of them were but he noticed how she cradled his sister and his niece. Whispering nothing but reassurance to them. “It’s okay they’re gone now…you’re both safe” he heard her. She has always taken care of Helaena and the kids well.   Noticing his presence his wife looked up finding him unable to move from the doorway. She lets go of her grieving sister in law and niece as she walks to him. Her eyes were teary and red.   Oh how he hates to see her cry.  He looks down at her cupping her cheek with one hand.  “Where were you?” Her question rang through his ear as her voice cracked on the last word she spoke. Guilt consumed him- no. Guilt starts to eat him slowly but surely. Eating him alive as her wife her sister his niece and his brother grieve for the death of the young innocent prince. He couldn’t say a word instead hugging his wife tight as she cried into his chest. Sobbing loudly as the castle was filled with darkness. Not a light of hope in sight.  “No one will hurt you. I swear it to you. I’m here..i’m here” he whispers to his wife as she cried.  He might’ve gotten used to the pain people put on him but he realized that he would never ever get used to seeing her cry.   He would never let anyone hurt her.  He would protect her from the cruel world.  Even from himself.  -  Every stranger makes me feel safer  And every person seems more beautiful  “I do regret that business with Luke I lost my temper that day. I am sorry for it.”  “They used to tease me y’know? Because I was different.”  He knew he should be seeking comfort from his wife but he couldn’t. As much as she makes him feel like him…he was still afraid his wife would see right through him. To judge him. So he couldn’t. Not to her.   He feels safer in the arms of a whore who has no power over him. While his wife she had all the power to control him if she could.   Nights went on and he sneaked out secretly. And no one knew. He was safe. His secret was safe.  Until Aegon…had to ruin everything like he always did.  Humiliating him was always his brother’s hobby.  Blinded with anger he stomps and storms back to the keep. Wanting his brother and the world to disappear. He wanted to be alone. He hated everything. Yet he didn’t realize that a certain someone was still awake.  Closing Helaena’s bedroom door lady Tyrell exits the queen’s bedroom for Helaena finds comfort from her sister in law. Just as she wanted to call it a night she’s standing face to face with no other than her husband.  “Aemond” she says in surprise.  He froze. He didn’t know what to say. All the rage and humiliation were gone in an instant. His face was covered with guilt and fear. “Wife” he answered with a hint of anxiety dripping down his tongue.  “Where have you been?” She chuckled thinking that he was just out for a walk or something. In her mind she would never ever even think that Aemond would be doing things like that behind her back.   Aemond stiffened unable to answer. Before his brother always had to ruin the show.  “Look who it is!” Aegon says as his kingsguard follows behind him. “Your husband here…well how do I say it..ah yes was in the whore house dear sister” Aegon cackles nudging Aemond’s arm before earning a hard punch from Aemond.   He saw red. He saw red in his eyes. He hated his brother. He hates him. He should’ve shut up. He never should’ve brought him to that place in the first place he should’ve never returned to that place!-  “What..?” His wife’s voice slightly trembled.  Even when Aegon was in pain on the ground he cackled. Obviously still drunk. “You heard me! He was fucking that whore like a hound!” Aegon continues to say and starts to make howling sounds.   Aemond saw how she started to grip her nightgown her hands trembling. Her eyes were teary not wanting to cry.  He disappointed her.  Disappointing the only person who has faith in him.  “I…I must go…sleep well your grace and….husband” she says nervously as she curtsied at the two brothers before walking away.   He watched her walk away. Not daring to chase after her or call out her name. He wouldn’t dare for he knew he disappointed her deeply. He hurt her again. Like how he did as a child. And now he’s sure she won’t come back to him. This was the start of him losing her.  -  She hasn’t talked to him since then. What used to be civil and peaceful. Her small talks and smiles weren’t present at his presence. She avoided him at all times. To the point where enough was enough. He couldn’t live like this. He needed her to talk to him. He doesn’t want his marriage to end like his father and his mother. He cares for her…he…he…he loves her.  And when he blinks he finds himself standing in front of her chamber doors one morning.   He knocked gently.  “Come in” he heard her sweet voice that he missed from her room.   When he enters he received her sad and surprised expression.  “Husband” she greeted stoically looking away.  He then realized how her closet was wide open and empty. Her clothes scattered on the bed as he saw her stuffing her dresses onto her..  “What’s this?!” He protested.  “Mother said it’s not safe for me to be in kings landing. War is coming and…I must go home” she says in a sad tone.  His heart sank deep hearing her words.  She’s leaving.  She’s leaving him.  “You are not going anywhere” he insisted roughly taking dresses out of her hands.   “Aemond-“  “Not on my sight!-“  “But Aemond-!”  “You are safe here! With me! With Vhagar!” He exclaims roughly taking out of her dresses from her trunk.   “Aemond stop it!”  Yet Aemond does not answer.   “I will keep you safe. Vhagar will keep you safe no one will never hurt you-“  “But you did!”  Silence.  Gods he hated the silence between them.  “You don’t understand” he grunts as he grips the bedsheets. “How can I understand if you never let me in?!” She protested tears streaming down from her eyes. He doesn’t even want to look at her. He didn’t want to see her cry.  “See? You wouldn’t even look at me! You wouldn’t touch me you wouldn’t kiss me you…” she points out.   Aemond sighs in defeat.   It was all his fault.  But then he roughly took off his eyepatch towering over her gripping her wrist as he showed his sapphire eye to her. “And would you? Would you touch this monster hm? Kiss this husband of yours who’s the reason why two innocent boys are killed? The reason why this war STARTED IN THE FIRST PLACE?!”   She flinched.  She closed her eyes scared…waiting for him to do something to her.  It broke him.   “I…I..forgive me I..” Aemond lowers down his voice and hand releasing her. Now guilt and shame has finally eaten him whole. He hurt her. Again and again. She deserved better.   Then came a knock on the door.  “Sorry for interrupting my prince but..the council awaits your presence” A guard said to him.  “I’ll be there.”  -  Aemond took his time and walked out of her chambers with her as her trunks were carried out from her room. It was present how there’s a gap between them. He wanted to hold her hand terribly but he couldn’t. Not after what he did to her.  He felt how people were looking. Eyes on them as they walked through the halls of the red keep. He tried one more time to reach his pinky finger to hers but when they touched she pulled her hand away to rub her other arm.   He lost her.  He probably never had her in the first place.  When they reached her carriage he didn’t want to tear his eyes from her.   “I would y’know?” She suddenly says with her gentle voice.  “Pardon?”  “I would…kiss and touch you” she repeats. “The monster you said of…is still my husband. You’re still my husband” she emphasizes.  Her words touched him somewhere in the deepest parts of his heart that no one has touched before. It made him frozen and unable to move a single muscle or bone in his body.  “I know that I am not what you needed and I know that I’m nothing to you-.”  She was terribly wrong. How wrong she was. She meant the world to him.  She was…everything to him.  “I hope you will find what you’re looking for in the future.”   He didn’t want anyone but her.   They looked back and saw people watching.  They’re waiting.  They’re watching.  She has always been far much braver than him. So she walked back to him placing a gentle kiss on his cheek just beneath his eye patch. Beneath his scar.   “Geros ilas my love…avy jorrāelan” she whispered to him before pulling away and stepping into her carriage without looking back.  And little did Aemond know that will be the last time he would ever get to see her.   In his heart he blamed the world again.   He blamed his brother.  He blamed everyone and everything that took her away from him.  Maybe in another life the war wouldn’t have happened Aegon wouldn’t have took him to the brothel Lucerys didn’t take his eye and maybe.. he could hold her like a normal person would. Maybe they’d have children…and maybe…maybe she’d stay.   But right now he walks back to the keep to assemble their army. To rook’s rest. To prove his brother and the whole world. To win this war.  For her.   a/n: Hello everyone! I’m Alice and thank you so much for reading! Fyi I used to write on tumblr but my old account was like semi suspended?

I just can’t 🤦🏻‍♀️  They start off by claiming Luke also commanded Arrax in common and he listened. Never happened. Luke only uses HV. Aemond freaked out and used the wrong language and guess what? Vhagar didn’t listen.  Vhagar not responding to commands in common while Sunfyre quite clearly does just proves that Sunfyre is in fact a bilingual dragon. We see him respond when Aegon urges him to go faster in common. We also see him breathe fire when told to in HV. He understands both languages while other dragons do not.   I seriously don’t understand the point of this post. They were proven wrong by several people pointing out that it was Aemond using common tongue and not Luke. They even admitted themselves that Vhagar does not abide by the commands given in common but they still insist that Sunfyre obeying in two languages isn’t that special and doesn’t mean he is bilingual.   And the greens are the “delusional” ones for being happy that we see something unique and special about Sunfyre. Are we sure the greens are the problem here? The common denominator between this individual and the greens as a whole is this individual who clearly has trouble understanding and accepting simple facts. Pretty sure this individual is the one that is delulu not the entire green fan base. Just sayin.,2024-07-11 15:50:23 GMT

Forewarned of their coming Lord Staunton closed his gates and defied the attackers. Behind his walls his lordship could only watch as his fields and woods and villages were burned his sheep and cattle and smallfolk put to the sword. When provisions inside the castle began to run low he dispatched a raven to Dragonstone pleading for succor…  Here Mushroom’s version seems most likely for we know that nine days after Lord Staunton dispatched his plea for help the sound of leathern wings was heard across the sea and the dragon Meleys appeared above Rook’s Rest. The Red Queen she was called for the scarlet scales that covered her. The membranes of her wings were pink her crest horns and claws bright as copper. And on her back in steel and copper armor that flashed in the sun rode Rhaenys Targaryen the Queen Who Never Was.  Ser Criston Cole was not dismayed. Aegon’s Hand had expected this counted on it. Drums beat out a command and archers rushed forward longbowmen and crossbowmen both filling the air with arrows and quarrels. Scorpions were cranked upward to loose iron bolts of the sort that had once felled Meraxes in Dorne. Meleys suffered a score of hits but the arrows only served to make her angry. She swept down spitting fire to right and left. Knights burned in their saddles as the hair and hide and harness of their horses went up in flames. Men-at-arms dropped their spears and scattered. Some tried to hide behind their shields but neither oak nor iron could withstand dragon’s breath. Ser Criston sat on his white horse shouting “Aim for the rider” through the smoke and flame. Meleys roared smoke swirling from her nostrils a stallion kicking in her jaws as tongues of fire engulfed him.  Then came an answering roar. Two more winged shapes appeared: the king astride Sunfyre the Golden and his brother Aemond upon Vhagar. Criston Cole had sprung his trap and Rhaenys had come snatching at the bait. Now the teeth closed round her.  Princess Rhaenys made no attempt to flee. With a glad cry and a crack of her whip she turned Meleys toward the foe. Against Vhagar alone she might have had some chance but against Vhagar and Sunfyre together doom was certain. The dragons met violently a thousand feet above the field of battle as balls of fire burst and blossomed so bright that men swore later that the sky was full of suns. The crimson jaws of Meleys closed round Sunfyre’s golden neck for a moment till Vhagar fell upon them from above. All three beasts went spinning toward the ground. They struck the ground so hard that stones fell from the battlements of Rook’s Rest half a league away.  Those closest to the dragons did not live to tell the tale. Those farther off could not see for the flame and smoke. It was hours before the fires guttered out. But from those ashes only Vhagar rose unharmed. Meleys was dead broken by the fall and ripped to pieces upon the ground. And Sunfyre that splendid golden beast had one wing half torn from his body whilst his royal rider had suffered broken ribs a broken hip and burns that covered half his body. His left arm was the worst. The dragonflame had burned so hot that the king’s armor had melted into his flesh.   A body believed to be Rhaenys Targaryen was later found beside the carcass of her dragon but it was so blackened that no one could be sure it was her. Beloved daughter of Lady Jocelyn Baratheon and Prince Aemon Targaryen faithful wife to Lord Corlys Velaryon mother and grandmother the Queen Who Never Was lived fearlessly and died amidst blood and fire. She was fifty-five years old.”  -Fire and Blood George R.R. Martin     (Arts by Vak Phoenix Jordi Gonzalez Escamilla Douglas Wheatley fkadaenerys),2024-07-11 16:36:09 GMT

Though he thinks himself a knight and concerned with duty and honor he spends most of his free time with his own squires tormenting all the Brackens that they happen upon. Celeste Feathers is the bastard daughter born of Amos Bracken and a Summer Isle whore. At the chance of a higher dowry for her daughter the baby was sent to live with her father in the wet and windy Riverlands until a husband was chosen for her. Though the two had a chance encounter as children they have only heard stories about each other in the meantime until one fateful day near the boundary line in the forest.   wc: 5.3k/16.8k chapter: 3/?  &lt;!-- more --&gt; tw: i dont proofread lmao  On the following night Celeste approached the riverbank: Davos standing near a small boat ready to be simply pushed into the river for the night’s adventure. He offered her a set of oars when he saw her encouraging her to share in their misgivings. She was used to rowing but she had not thought that his interests were beyond bedding her. She smiled through the rowing happy to feel the river water hitting her face and her gown.  &quot;I came without my cloak” Celeste said eventually surprised the boy had not made note of it himself. “To better conceal myself but if we are far from the shore…” she said with a lack of surety. “I’m sure it matters not now.”  “Aye’ the young man responded. “The mist deepens as the river proceeds but I appreciate the efforts.”  Celeste’s brows furrowed but she said nothing else. As the boy had said mist began to rise above them and after a few minutes it was so thick that they could not see very far beyond their oars. She continued to paddle once she saw that Davos seemed intent on his path.  “Is there somewhere you’re taking us?”  Davos continued to paddle his eyes scanning the mist that had enveloped them. He could barely see beyond the oars and the air was thick and heavy.  Despite the lack of visibility he had a destination in mind a secluded spot he often visited when he wanted to be alone.  “Just a little further” he said his voice low and steady. “We’re almost there.”  “A tavern no doubt” the lady chuckled continuing to row. She felt the weight of her damp hair on her back the oars growing heavy in her hand but she wouldn’t complain.  He scanned the girl’s face looking to see if she was joking or suspected that he would in fact bring her to a tavern. He was not against the idea and if she were less discernible perhaps he would have covered her nicely and brought her a pint. Wishful thinking he assumed and continued to row.  “No beer for the hour’ he confirmed. &quot;Besides. A pretty girl like you at the tap? I’d be fighting them off and spilling my drink. You’d oughta catch an elbow in the fray.”  “I’d hold my own” Celeste campaigned with a smirk. “And I’d put a coin down for your spilled drink if it please you.”  Davos chuckled at her response his eyes darting over her face. He could see the mischievous glint in her eye and it only made his smile widen.  “Is that right?” he asked raising an eyebrow. “A worthy cause no less… I would pay the pretty penny to see your skirt fly up when they knock you down my fair lady. It is not what you think it is.”  Celeste gave a wry laugh and nodded. “Most things are not” she said. She looked up at the full moon and back down at the boat a small but fortified thing. She yawned in fatigue. Though she was excited to see Davos she knew the night would be as long as it felt short and they would again have to row down the current-filled river and trudge back to their domains to start the new day and all sleep would be lost.  She began to row a bit slower the moonlight gracing her face brilliantly. “What are your thoughts about our time together yesterday? Are you regretful?”  Davos began to row slower as Celeste offered less help. He had not expected the river to be so choppy and he knew that it was a difficult passage for even a strong man let alone a woman not used to the river.  He was slightly taken aback by her question; he was rarely moved to think critically of his actions or his motivations but he had felt a stirring in his chest.  “I am not regretful Celeste. I wish you were not who you were. That is the complication of the matter.”  As they slowed Celeste looked listlessly out onto the water cringing slightly when she heard his response.  “The fighting serves no purpose. I have no true allegiance to the house-” he cut her off.  “Oh but you do” he said scathing irritation marking his words. “A better claim than most of the rest of the Bracken dogs. The lord’s daughter no less” Davos rolled his eyes. “I cannot decide whether no allegiance or fealty to the shorn and shaven hound is worse. You are a member of their house. A lady. If I was half the Blackwood I ought to be I’d push you over the boat and rid Westeros of one more scourge.”  “If you so desire” Celeste said knowing he would not hurt her. He was full of emotions some violent some intimate but all passionate. Just a young man she thought so dissimilar to the knights of the stories she had read as a girl.  Davos paused and chuckled shaking his head. “You’re a cheeky wench you know that?”  He reached out quickly making the girl jump in her spot a loud noise echoing out from the oars knocking against the boat. Davos took the oars from her chuckling loudly at the fear he had caused before he winked at her and returned to his place beginning to push the boat in a single steady direction.  “There’s no use in wasting a perfectly good cunt. Especially not one as tight as yours” he said as he rowed forward having to come closer to the girl to over compensate as the only rower. Celeste looked down at him distastefully unsure if she was meant to be offended or flattered.  She looked down at her hand a throbbing sensation building and saw blood rising from her finger in the moonlight.  “You broke the skin” Celeste began glib.  Davos cut his eyes over at the girl feeling a twinge of guilt. “I’ll take care of it” he said as the boat hit a sandy bank. He threw his legs over the side quickly helping the girl out before dragging it upon shore the water lapping at his feet. Celeste could see that they had reached a keep on an isolated island but beyond the walls she could see the crown of a heart tree in the center. Her house worshiped the new gods but she knew the island must be sacred to the Blackwoods. She turned quickly to advise against her presence to ask to go somewhere else even back to the boat but Davos was right behind her when she turned. He took her hands into his.  She watched with wide eyes as he took her bleeding finger into his mouth applying pressure on the scrape to stop the bleeding and sooth the ache. They stood together the river lapping on the shore for a moment before he took her finger from his mouth.  Davos moved forward and kissed her cheek then the skin right before her ear. “I only meant to scare you. I’m sorry for the blood.”  Celeste watched him as he took a few steps back and she nodded accepting that it was only an accident.  Davos nodded towards the keep encouraging her to follow him. He pushed the doors open and before the godswood there were beautifully carved benches and candle holders. He led her towards a place to sit and there they sat their shoulders touching slightly as they looked onto the massive tree in the center of the garden the moon dancing over it.  “It is beautiful here” Celeste remarked.  Davos watched the girl from the corner of his eye observing the wonder in her gaze as she looked at the ancient heart tree in the garden.  “They say this place is sacred to my family” he explained his voice low. “This island has been here for centuries long before the castle long before my family. My ancestors built the keep here in honor of the tree. The heart tree they call it.”  He shifted his body towards her slightly his shoulder now fully attached to her own. He could feel the heat radiating from her body mingling with his own in the cold damp air. He watched her expression cautiously afraid that she might say something that would cause him offense.  “It is not my belief as I’m sure you know” Celeste began immediately shrinking when she heard Davos scoff.  “The seven devils you hold fealty to but not your house?” Davos said rolling his eyes defensively. “Something that actually exists?”  Celeste frowned and turned her head away from the boy looking back at the heart tree majestic and flowing slowly in the wind. “You will live longer if your blood only cools” she said with a sad smirk.  Poor boy she thought. How she only wanted to kiss his cheeks and make him better but she was a fool if she thought all their problems would be assuaged just because he had taken her virginity and buried his locks in the nape of her neck. The were still rivals but possibly worse off now. They had both exposed their neck.  “The godswood” she called it confidently. “Is beautiful. It feels like a powerful place to me. I know it is important to you and your people.”  Davos breathed in her words before sighing his shoulders slumping slightly. He felt the anger leave his body as he stared at her face in the glow of the tree and let his head rest lightly on the wall of the keep. He knew she meant no disrespect but her words had caused a small wave of irritation to bubble in his stomach.  “It is important” he said quietly. “Without the prayers to the old gods our house would fall into ruin. Or so they say. I do think my sword would remedy the problem.”  He reached out gently taking her hand in his own their fingers lacing together.  “Do you like to be with me Celeste or are you just lonely?”  Davos let the two sit in silence for only a beat. He continued: “I know the trees aren’t much for amusement. Are you fine here with me” he said sitting up and pressing his elbows onto his knees turning so he could see the girl’s face completely his own shrouded in darkness.  “Yes” the girl choked out taken aback by the boy’s sudden forward nature. She was frozen in his gaze. She searched his eyes quickly before continuing: “I cannot fathom what would bring you to me thrice over. I’m–” she paused. “We have very little to offer each other. You may grant me secession from my solitude but I have nothing that is of use to you.”  Davos reached out and touched her cheek. “Do not lie” he chided softly his fingers resting on her soft skin. “You are a good distraction” he began a soft chuckle following. “A pretty face is no less useful than a horse or a blade or a keep.”  He breathed out running his thumb over her lips gently as his eyes darted over her face.  “Tell me how we’re the same” he said his voice low. “Name one thing.”  Her ears perked up at the word ‘distraction’ but she could not ask a question before he continued his thumb over her lips.  “The same” she mused unable to pull her eyes away from the boy. Her heartbeat was aflutter. “I’m afraid we may both have dreams that are beyond our means.”  His thumb continued to move softly over her lips. He watched the slight smirk that sat on the pink flesh of her mouth and felt the soft skin brush against him with each word she spoke. He breathed out slowly feeling his heart pound slightly harder in his chest. He felt his face burn with a heat that he was not used to and he quickly moved his hand away from her.  “What do you mean?” he said in a low voice  He swallowed unsure of where to rest his hands then.  She felt alone quickly but not afraid. She attempted to avoid offending the boy but she would debase herself as well so what could be the problem. Celeste looked up at the moon. “You want to be a great knight a dutiful lord but you spend your days with your squires only multiplying your revelry. When your father passes you will be young and then who will guide you? Your equally hot-blooded knights? Into war?”  Celeste sighed and looked at him a frown on her face revealing understanding rather than disappointment. “I oft think of what my life outside of this place would have been like were I not looked down upon because of my sex the color of my skin. I hoped as a child that my position would be elevated one day but it seems I will always creep around the castle in the shadows like a mouse until my father dies and then I’m sure they will rid themselves of me. I am the lord’s daughter but I am no lady… it’s as if the shoes you were given were much too big and the ones bestowed upon me much too small.”  As the girl spoke Davos felt his heart sink into his stomach. The words she spoke echoed the same thoughts that plagued him in the night. In the hours he would spend with his men drinking away the fears and doubts that crept into his mind in the darkness.  Her soft melancholic words cut through him like a knife. They were true all of them. He cleared his throat feeling it growing constricted from the emotions building inside.  “It’s the same for all of us” he said quietly his fingers tracing patterns on his palm nervously. “I hope to die in battle before I have to deny a starving mother the bread she needs to feed her child. There is no true glory this far from King’s Landing. The squabbles are fair game but to be lord of the river?” He scoffed amused by something he had never dared to say out loud. “And now they speak of war” he shook his head.  “You are a morbid little raven. Brilliant and damned and wasted on Bracken soil…” Davos looked at the young woman for a second before straightening his back and leaning on the wall again beside her. They listened to the wind hitting the keep though it was quiet around them.  “I’d raise you up. No one would make you feel less than worthy if you were my claim” he said a righteous anger in the back of his throat. “You deserve much more. There would be a sword for all that spoke against you.”  Celeste again was intrigued by his speaking. War? She had not heard of it herself she’d only felt a shifting of the seasons. She thought to ask about this as well but he’d spoken again before she’d gotten the space to break the silence herself.  Suddenly in his gruff tone he said things so sweet that she felt her heart beating quickly in that still night. She looked over at the boy still so shocked that only nights ago he had granted her few delicacies. It was true of course that Celeste had never known a man or even suffered the affection the childhood pestering of a boy-aged crush. She had played with her brothers and some of the children of the servants even lanced with a few in secret but not much else. The attention no matter how it vacillated that she drew from Davos was like nectar to the flying insects. So sweet so enticing but painful to look upon. A pervasive buzzing in her ear.  To a degree Celeste felt silly as a girl as a common-folk wench that believed a lord might be genuine but she felt as though Davos had been honest with her. He must have and even if he wasn’t what other option did she have to feel held? Feel the blood rush to her cheeks? They had already come so far she thought why let the fear succeed now?  “A dignified concubine of Lord Blackwood aye?” Celeste giggled and shook her head. “I always thought of myself as a wife.”  Davos felt the laugh that jumped from her throat like a spear through his heart. He watched the young woman giggle softly the laugh only growing slightly as her cheeks turned a bright red.  “A wife?” he echoed quietly unable to keep the smile from spreading on his face. “You?”  Davos let out a chuckle the sound low and hushed to not travel too far in the night. His knee brushed against hers slightly in a gentle push.  “You would have to stop your late night adventures the running amuck. The woods are no place for child rearing.”  Celeste rolled her eyes and turned to the boy playfully. “They are perfect for child-making you seem to think” she whispered a sly smirk tugging on her lips.  Davos’ eyes widened as she smirked at him feeling a hot heat spread across his face and travel down his body in an instant. He smiled as well foolishly and gathered the girl up in his arms quickly their faces just an inch apart.  “You are an insolent brat but” he gave her a quick kiss on the lips and brandished a smile. “My favorite of them all.”  Still holding her her head reclining back on the keep he thought for a second. “Your children will be courageous. Little warriors. They’ll be like their mother.”  Celeste smiled leisurely. “Say I stop the running amuck and I return to my gowns. Next you’ll say I must bite my tongue or refuse to practice the sword with my nephews. Then what will you like of me Lord Davos? I’ll be just like all other maidens.”  His face softened slightly as she mentioned giving up her free spirit. He knew that the world she wanted to live in was one where she could fight as well as any boy and laugh as much as any man. He also knew it was a fantasy not meant to be.  Davos ran his fingers through her hair pushing the locks behind her ear and studying her young face.  “Be as no other maiden” he said softly assuring her. “I would like your tongue as much as I like it now. It would please me to see sons taught chivalry by the same woman they ought to honor. It would also please me very well to see you in a gown…” He paused and smiled. “It would please me the most to be the one to strip it from you… I would take nothing from you Celeste.”  Celeste blushed. “You weave a beautiful web Davos. I did not think it was capable. Perhaps the weirwood trees do influence your people or” she checked over their shoulders. “It’s the late hour.”  Celeste sighed tightening her grip on Davos’s arms. “You would have me as a wife? If our family’s feud had not so long been waged and contested? You would honor me?”  As she tightened her grip on his arms he held onto her tighter his fingers tracing soft patterns over her skin. He breathed in the words she spoke and allowed himself to imagine what they would look like in another life.  “I fear I am actually in my bed pushed down by fever and this is some dream cast upon me from Harrenhal” he sighed. “Perhaps you are a witch. Do you spend your days crafting love potions to entice me?”  “I am no witch” Celeste said plainly.  “I fear no wife will serve me as you would. You’ve burned your home in my thoughts sweetling. Has it occurred to you that you will never belong to me?” He said.  Celeste’s face broke into a frown as she caressed Davos’s hair. “You speak of nothing joyous. I am yours sweet boy.”  Their position her fingers in his hair the soft touches along his skin; it was torture to feel the gentle affection. But he was greedy and selfish and he allowed himself to bask in her attention just a moment longer.  “You will always be mine. In every form” he breathed his eyes closing slightly as he pressed his face against her palm. He breathed out softly before looking up at her again with his brow furrowed. “You do not know the damage you’ve done.”  Celeste watched the boy stand up quickly running his fingers through his hair before he sighed beginning to head towards the entrance to the keep. She followed after him almost missing her step after his long strides.  “What is the matter?” She called after him but he was already beginning to push the boat back into the river.  “Say that I love you” he called out to her the lapping of the river rather loud over his voice. “And I carry your burden raise you up to stature and father your children. Say you make me a happy man Celeste. What is that worth if both of our castles are burnt down in the fray and my men whisper of me being a traitor for the rest of my rule? Do you think your father would let you go easily?”  Davos shook his head pushing a set of oars into Celeste’s arms. “Your people call us cannibals; they act as if we’re no more than barbarians. Your father would be sending you to be ripped apart and eaten like a ham… you’ve gotten into my mind with your words. It’s a fever that will not subside. A dream that I cannot follow. Please” he sighed in relief begging.  “It is not enough for you and it is not enough for me… why must you be of Bracken soot? You’ve made it harder than I intended.”  Celeste threw her oars into the boat looking at Davos with cruel eyes. She pushed him in the chest. “You came upon me and then you came back you coward. Had you not heard the whispers about me? The Bracken’s wayward bastard that likes to play with boy’s toys? You knew me and still came upon me. Likely stalked me in the woods and pounced when you saw that I was vulnerable. You wanted me Davos so place this not on me. You’re a knight a man a lord. Or is everything you’ve said to me pretense?”  The moment she pushed at his chest Davos stopped for a second his breath catching in his throat. He looked up at her taken aback by her fierce and defensive stance. But then he chuckled a little. The sound of amusement did not reach his eyes though and in fact they darkened as she spoke.  He was quick to grab her by her arms his hands holding on tightly enough that if she were any other woman it would have been uncomfortable – almost painful. He did not want to hurt her of course but he wanted her to listen.  “Say I take you as my wife you daft child. You trade one inconvenience for another. We only have each other.”  “We would have each other” Celeste yelled frustrated. She had not thought that their marriage-talks were sincere they were playing a game of make-believe but suddenly it felt quite real as if Davos had thought about it even momentarily.  “It would be the end of a thousand year war. So what if they call you &#x27;traitor’. I would call you &#x27;reconciliator’. It is a dream Davos but our history has been forged by visions and dreams and men who were not afraid” she pulled herself from his grip.  “A dream” he breathed in response.  She was right of course she always was. He thought of the legends his father and grandfather had told him since he could talk; the myths of Garth Greenhand. He thought of the history of his house that was written down for all to see and of the stories passed down from father to son in private and secret. How many boys must have dreamed the same dream?  &#x27;No matter’ he thought to himself nodding at the girl to take her place in the boat. He turned his back on her and spoke.  “Your desire to no longer know loneliness is great enough to cause the bloodshed of thousands of men. You are not the woman you think yourself to be Celeste.”  Celeste stepped into the boat feeling the boy roughly push it into the waves before he got into it as well.  “If you were in my station you would feel very little loyalty yourself. My father is the only reason I’ve stayed but he will die… eventually. He is the only Bracken man that might be swayed. My brothers are vicious creatures. War hungry.”  Celeste thought for a few seconds rowing the boat silently. “There may be another maiden you love one day and there may be another knight to entice me but there may never come another time to unite our houses Davos. I’ve read the histories listened in on counsel meetings. I will never be a soldier but I have the ability to think. All my life they’ve tried to find a solution to the feud between our houses. I believe there may only be this one peaceful option. I won’t be known for much else but if I can help bring peace to these lands maybe it wasn’t all for naught.”  He listened to her words letting them sink in before eventually sighing out loudly scrubbing at his face. Davos felt as if he was being pulled in two different directions both of them too powerful for him not to resist. On one side there was his loyalty and on the other there she was.  The Blackwood leaned back staring up at the sky and the endless stars that littered the abyss above glittering like diamonds.  He reached across the small space between them to pull her hand from the oar and into his lap lacing his fingers with hers. The boat idled in the middle of the river spinning softly.  “I knew not your wish to be a saint.”  “It may go unfulfilled” Davos said releasing her hands and returning to the oars.  Celeste stared at the boy in the icy night before shaking her head. “We should not see each other again. It will only become more painful from here.”  Davos cut his eyes at the girl. Her words and actions so viscerally reenacting a child’s fit. He was shocked that she had not gotten onto the floor of the boat and began to kick and cry.  He could not think of anything other than the thought of never seeing her again or perhaps the thought of seeing her again. Would she marry a knight? Would she be left alone an unmarried hen stalking around the castle unwanted and untouched?  Would they spend the rest of their lives professing their love for each other in secrecy or would he slit her throat after years of listening to her droning on about her mistreatment at Bracken hands?  Temporarily he wished he would have stuck to bedding women from his own land who could not read and could not argue but had she not made him feel ten times more than he ever had in only days. And would she not spend the rest of their lives shaping him into a man and would he not find pleasure in making her into a woman? Laughing as she contorted her face at dinner when faced with hosting all the lords and ladies?  He thought about her body– thought about how he’d hold her through every new orgasm he’d grant her and he smiled to himself when he remembered that she herself didn’t completely know her body yet.  Celeste would be a fine wife the only one he could tolerate but he knew his father would have his head if he so much as mentioned the Bracken girl as an option for betrothal but all things considered if the Brackens were to offer a sizable amount of land and stock as the girl’s dowry as well as say subservience to the Blackwood house during times of war… how could any studied lord say no?  It was a dream as Celeste had said but from the severity of her dark eyes he knew he would have to do something or else he would not see her again.  They neared the place they had originated the moon still shining brightly though the night was still.  Davos cleared his throat. “I will talk to my father. If there is any peace to be had we will root it out but” he cleared his throat. “This itself may be the cause of more bloodshed. If it is what you want.”  “If it is what I want” Celeste mocked snidely rolling her eyes. “Do as you wish Davos.” As they hit the rocky shore she stood from the boat quickly walking to the direction of the Bracken hold.  “If the news is optimistic you’ll hear of it’ Davos called after her causing Celeste to stop in her tracks. &quot;If your father rejects the terms you will hear of it’ he said docking the boat and walking swiftly to catch up to her.  &quot;If my father denies me however I will send word to you. In a fortnight’ he sighed and rung his hands. &quot;If it is the latter of those options I will see you once more. I swear it. By the old gods and the new’ he reached for her hand and squeezed it tightly. &quot;It was not all pretense. You have vexed me. Don’t depart in such haste.”  “The hour is late Davos’ Celeste said the moon illuminating her gaze. Her mood was dampened as was her hair and the lateness of the hour had begun to weigh on her. She was tired. She considered that the two would never hold each other through the night or wake up cradling one another. Her heart sank.  &quot;I’m afraid I asked for too much when perchance it was best to hold on to what we had but’ she bit her lip. &quot;I am tired of dreams. I want real things.”  Davos laughed and petted the girl’s head before scratching gently behind her ear. She scrunched her nose.  “I had not expected you to bite your tongue’ he said with a bittersweet smile before moving forward to kiss her. At first barely but then passionately holding her waist and she clutched him around his neck. They kissed as if it were the first time knowing that it may be the last.  &quot;Will you remember this? The next time we see each other? Whenever that may be.”  Celeste pulled away from the kiss tears on the brim of her eyes. She blamed the flurry of emotions on the hour.  “If we are betrothed there will be no need. There will be more to come. But if you are my enemy when next we cross paths I will smile upon you Davos… you will amount to so much” she caressed his hair before giving him a small kiss on the nose.  Davos felt his heart break at the sight of her tears and he reached up to stroke her wet cheek gently with his thumb. He leaned in to rest his forehead against hers taking in her scent and the feel of her skin against his. He closed his eyes trying to hold this moment in his memory forever.  “There will be more to come” he repeated softly holding her close to him.  tag list: @shifter-101 @greatdarkqueen  author note: just one more chapter to go hopefully next week xx,2024-07-11 17:42:44 GMT

45,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'game of thrones'  'a song of ice and fire'  'asoiaf'  'anti team black'  'anti targ stans'],rise-my-angel,Me getting an anon calling me a hypocrite because I liked the moment between Aegon and Sunfyre even though I do not like the dragons.   No I don’t like the dragons. But I do in fact like moments that showcase that their riders treat them as more then just horses. I don’t like Rhaenys but I like her bonding with Meleys before battle. And I liked that Sunfyre was excited to see Aegon and booped him in the chest. I don’t have to like the dragons to think those are nice and cute moments. Unlike you people not everything I think is in black and white.  I am against the dragons because they are literal one for one metaphors for weapons of mass destruction but I do also acknowledge that they are sentient and intelligent creatures and seeing moments of them bonding with their riders is a breath of fresh because in a season and a half we barley see the riders interact with their dragons in one on one personal ways. Sunfyre booping Aegon reminded me of how playful and affectionate Ghost is with Jon. Get over it.   Sorry your side of the fandom is too stupid to understand I can dislike something and still call a small part of it cute.,2024-07-11 17:37:04 GMT

9,House of the Dragon,['asoiaf'  'daemon targeryan'  'pro daemon targaryen'  'grrm'  'alyssa targaryen'  'baelon targaryen'],1800naveen,Sometimes I wonder if Daemon would be a different person than who he is now if Alyssa never died.  He lost her at a young age going with 4 years old when she passed (his age wasn’t mentioned). He only had Baelon and Viserys as he grew up (Rhaenys was there too but I don’t know much about their relationship as cousins). Not having a mother figure probably gave him some issues like attachment or a feeling of loneliness.  He was either in his late teens or early twenties when Baelon passed away so I assume that affected him. He wants Viserys’ love as they only got each other now. How he gave Vizzy a hug in episode 4 he leaned into his shoulder like how a child would lean into a parent’s.  What’s your opinion on it? If Alyssa never passed in childbirth and was there to watch her sons grow and start families of their own would he be the same? Would he be different?  I could see him being a tamer version of his current self.,2024-07-11 18:53:54 GMT

So I named him Aerion after King Aegon the Conqueror’s father. I always wondered what happened to the boy’s fate.,2024-07-11 18:48:55 GMT

Because even though Viserys preferred Rhaenyra neither of them was ever truly enough for him: Rhaenyra is Aemma’s child but she’s not a boy and Aegon is a boy but he’s not Aemma’s child. Viserys named Rhaenyra heir but never changed the law that would have allowed her to be queen unchallenged. He refused to actually choose because neither of them was who he had invisioned would sit on the throne after him.   Basically it was Viserys’ inbility to love his children for who they were that doomed house Targaryen and that’s a hill i will die on.         (and Otto. It was also Otto),2024-07-11 18:44:16 GMT

Women in medieval times had to be obedient to their husbands being a Targaryen is no exception you are still a woman.  Came from this post :  Make Me Your Villain  How are the Greens children more Targaryen than Rhaenyra’s children ?   By blood they are on the same level a Targaryen biological parent and a non-Targaryen biological parent.   Behaviorally ? The Greens children don’t behave like Targaryens.   This is just a fact for all the reasons I cited in the post above.  And then if this person is talking about obeying her husband… ?   Laenor agreed with Rhaenyra to have children through Harwin.   So what is this person even talking about ?   As if Rhaenyra had disobeyed her husband ? She did not do it.   Unless this person just wants to say that Rhaenyra should just be a perfect submissive woman like these misogyny people want…🙄,2024-07-11 18:39:59 GMT

9,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'alfred broome'  'the blacks'  'the greens'],blackbyrenflowers,I realize they’re playing up Alfred Broome as a rude contrarian intentionally but he’s kind of got a point. Rhaenyra dissappear for days at a time on solo missions without telling anyone where she’s going leaving the rest of the council nothing to do but sit on their hands until she returns. They don’t even have a Hand of the Queen to direct them in her absence.  What has Rhaenyra and the council achieved so far? I mean I have a lot of criticism about Daemon but at least in between getting psychically bullied into suicide by Alys he’s attempting to rally the Riverlands to their side.   Meanwhile on the Greens Cole’s sweeping through the Crownlands taking Duskendale Rosby and Stokeworth in like a week’s time.  Rhaenyra seeking peace would be admirable if Aegon hadn’t already made his thoughts on a truce well known by sending an assassin to murder Rhaenyra.

It’s “F&amp;B isn’t a reliable source” until it comes to Rhaenyra. Like please shut up. Why does it upset you? Because now you have less reason to despise or shit on the character? Because now you can’t justify your hate and misogyny? The books and show will be different. Fire &amp; Blood is not an actual novel it is various accounts of “he said she said” written with bias by a historian. I’m GLAD the show is different. It shows how history can become so misconstrued and it makes watching the show all the more exciting. Y’all just sound like pretentious cry babies. It’s not that serious. The fact that GRRM Mr. “Follow the source material” is fine with it should be reason enough for you to sit back and just enjoy it for what it is.,2024-07-11 19:25:18 GMT

Still have to see how they build her relationship to aemond however not showing her as a seductress (so far…) really gives to the concept of the show being historically correct while the book can be mistaken because of contradicting sources without using the « oops it was an accident » trope and without failing to bring the characters’ development to life.  It feels like cleopatra being depicted as a seductress with beauty as her main weapon while she actually did not used her beauty but her intelligence and charisma.  But because the writers feels like butchering every and each characters their relations to each other and any characters’ credibility this may not last.,2024-07-11 21:55:51 GMT

or was it just a coincidence? you had to be more cautious.  as you approached heleana’s chambers that night a figure stepped out of the shadows. it was aemond heleana’s brother. his intense gaze bored into you and you felt a chill run down your spine.  “aemond” you said trying to keep your voice steady. “what are you doing here?”  “i could ask you the same question” he replied his voice low and dangerous. “but i already know the answer.”  your blood ran cold. “i don’t know what you’re talking about.”  he stepped closer his eye never leaving yours. “stay away from her. if you care about heleana’s safety you’ll end this now.”  “i love her” you said your voice trembling with emotion. “i can’t just walk away.”  aemond’s expression hardened his lips curling into a sneer. “then you’re a fool. aegon will not tolerate this. he will make sure you suffer and he will destroy heleana in the process. do you want that on your conscience?”  your resolve faltered but your love for heleana burned bright. “i can’t abandon her.”  “then you will both perish” aemond said coldly. “i will not warn you again.”  with that he disappeared into the shadows leaving you alone in the dimly lit corridor. you took a deep breath steeling yourself and knocked on heleana’s door.  the door opened and heleana’s eyes widened in surprise. “y/n what’s wrong?”  you stepped inside closing the door behind you. “aemond knows.”  her face paled. “did he threaten you?”  “he warned me” you said taking her hands in yours. “but he also cares about you. he won’t betray us.”  heleana looked relieved but still worried. “we have to be more careful.”  you nodded pulling her into your arms. “we will be. we’ll find a way to be together without risking everything.”  she clung to you her fear palpable. “i can’t lose you.”  “you won’t” you promised holding her tightly. “we’ll find a way.”  as you lay together that night you couldn’t shake the feeling that your time was running out. but you would fight for every moment for every kiss and for the love that burned bright and fierce even in the darkness.  the tension in the castle grew over the following weeks. aegon’s suspicions were evident in his sharp glances and probing questions. alicent’s watchful eyes seemed to follow you everywhere. but you and heleana continued to find ways to be together your love a secret flame that refused to be extinguished.  one night as you made your way to heleana’s chambers you heard voices coming from within. you paused listening intently.  “you’re endangering us all” aemond’s voice said low and urgent.  “i love her aemond” heleana replied her voice breaking. “i can’t help it.”  “you have to end this” aemond said his tone cold and unyielding. “aegon is planning something. he’s determined to find out the truth.”  your heart raced as you listened. you had to warn heleana. you knocked softly on the door and it opened almost immediately.  heleana’s eyes widened in surprise. “y/n what are you doing here?”  “i overheard” you said stepping inside. “aegon is planning something. we have to be careful.”  aemond’s expression hardened further his gaze icy. “you need to leave. both of you. if you stay aegon will find you and make you suffer.”  “we have to go” heleana said her eyes wide with fear. “we have to get away from here.”  “where will we go?” you asked feeling a surge of desperation.  “dragonstone” heleana suggested desperation in her voice. “rhaenyra will protect us.”  aemond’s eyes flashed with anger. “do you think rhaenyra will welcome you with open arms? you are risking everything for a foolish dream.”  heleana looked at her brother tears in her eyes. “will you help us?”  aemond stared at her for a long moment before nodding reluctantly. “i will help you escape. but do not think this is the end. you will always be hunted.”  that night you and heleana fled the castle with aemond’s help. you rode through the night your hearts pounding with fear and exhilaration. as dawn broke you saw dragonstone rising in the distance a beacon of hope.  as you approached the gates of dragonstone a group of soldiers blocked your path. aemond’s expression turned cold and triumphant as he stepped forward signaling the soldiers to seize you both.  “aemond what is this?” heleana cried out her eyes wide with betrayal.  “i warned you” aemond said his voice icy. “you should have listened. aegon will not tolerate this… disgrace.”  the soldiers grabbed you and heleana forcing you to the ground. you struggled against their grip but it was futile.  “aemond please!” you begged desperation lacing your voice.  “you brought this upon yourselves” he said coldly turning away as the soldiers dragged you back toward king’s landing.  the return to the castle was a blur of fear and despair. as you and heleana were thrown into a cell you clung to each other your hearts breaking with the realization that your love had been your undoing.  days passed in the cold dark cell. aegon visited once his eyes filled with a cruel satisfaction as he taunted you both.  “you thought you could escape me?” he sneered. “you will pay for your defiance. both of you.”  heleana tried to comfort you her voice trembling as she whispered promises of a better future but you both knew the truth. there would be no escape no happy ending.  one night as you lay together on the cold stone floor heleana’s tears mingled with yours. “i’m sorry” she whispered her voice breaking. “i’m so sorry.”  you held her tightly your own tears falling freely. “i love you” you said your voice filled with pain and determination. “no matter what happens i will always love you.”  as the days turned into weeks you clung to that love finding strength in each other even as the darkness closed in. your love had been a forbidden flame burning bright and fierce but now it was a flickering ember struggling to survive.  and as the door to your cell creaked open one final time you faced your fate with heleana by your side your hearts united in a love that would never be extinguished even in the face of death.  aegon’s suspicions finally culminated in a brutal confrontation. the king flanked by his guards stormed into the cell where you and heleana were held. his face was twisted with rage and his voice was cold as ice.  “y/n you have bewitched my wife and brought disgrace upon this house” he declared. “you will be punished for your treachery.”  “aegon please” heleana pleaded tears streaming down her face. “she did nothing wrong. it was my choice.”  “silence!” aegon roared. “you have been corrupted by this… harlot. guards take her away.”  the guards seized you pulling you away from heleana’s grasp. you struggled desperate to stay by her side. “heleana! no! please!”  heleana’s screams echoed through the halls as she tried to reach you but aegon’s grip on her was unyielding. “you will be dealt with later” he said coldly to his wife. “but this one will suffer for her sins.”  the last thing you saw as you were dragged away was heleana’s tear-streaked face her cries of anguish haunting your every step. you were thrown into a separate cell the door slamming shut behind you with a finality that crushed your spirit.  days turned into weeks and you were left alone in the darkness the memory of heleana’s touch the only thing keeping you sane. you clung to the hope that she was safe that somehow she would be spared.  but as the days passed that hope began to fade. you were isolated punished for loving too deeply and the world outside your cell seemed to grow colder with each passing moment.  and as the darkness closed in you held onto the memory of heleana your forbidden flame knowing that your love though condemned would burn bright and fierce in your heart forever.  ⋅•⋅⊰∙∘☽༓☾∘∙⊱⋅•⋅  author’s note: do you want a letter from helena?

Aegon even called Aemond a “loyal hound” who knows his place in the Green Targtower Royal Family as an attack dog that he can set upon their family’s foes. Having Aemond get sexually exploited while as a child and then make fun of him with his friends as his supposed elder brother infuriated Aemond’s righteous fury at even Lucerys paid the price for it!

An AU where Rhaenyra leaves shortly after the hunt to travel Westeros on Syrax. Her visits now and then are the brightest spots in Aegon’s life.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Unfortunately for Alicent Aegon loved his big sister.  She was scared to leave them alone together. Rhaenyra’s eyes would thin into slits whenever they settled on Aegon much like Syrax’s right before she unhinged her jaw to rain fire. She didn’t even try to hide her contempt. He was just a baby yet it did not seem to matter. He was a boy and that was enough.   The hunt was disastrous. Rhaenyra came back all bloodied but before the king could scold her she rushed straight to Alicent and Aegon. Alicent did not want to hand him over to her not with her tracks of dried blood and matted locks iron stinking the air. Aegon would cry she was sure of it. But her boy looked up with wide eyes and raised his little fists towards Rhaenyra.   “Let me hold him” she said urgently. “I need to see.”  She held him awkwardly and Alicent had to help her shift the boy onto her hip. Rhaenyra closed her eyes and rested her forehead against his hair inhaled deeply. He smelled just like Baelon she thought. She could cry.   Aegon giggled and played with her hair. Rhaenyra caught one pudgy little wrist and squeezed. She turned her back to shield Aegon from her father’s view and cupped his cheek. Just the two of them. He was made just for her. She lowered her finger to the rabbit heart pulse on his neck and pressed her nail in.   The boy stopped and looked up at her but did not cry. She kept pressing harder wondering if she could break skin. Alicent saw and felt her heart drop. She couldn’t. She wouldn’t. Not here. She lurched towards them but before she could push Rhaenyra’s hand away Aegon’s laugh bubbled up. He turned his head downwards and kissed Rhaenyra’s wrist.   She let go immediately shocked.   He kicked his feet playful almost as if daring her to do it again.   Rhaenyra thrusted him back into his mother’s arms. She had to leave. She had to get out of here. King Viserys called for her ready to spout some sentimental drivel about family but she was out of earshot now. It didn’t matter anymore.   Alicent gripped Aegon ever tighter to herself. Her thumb worried over the half-moon Rhaenyra left on her son’s red red neck. Her father caught her eye over Visery’s shoulder and the nod he sent her seemed to seal her fate and everyone else’s. She felt her stomach drop.  -  Rhaenyra had to leave. That day sealed it. There was no place for her in King’s Landing. The offers her suitors brought her seemed more like compensation for her loss in title rather than anything real that could further her claim for the throne. A pathetic farce. She was heir was this what she was reduced to?  “If I am to rule I have to see the realm I rule over myself” she said to her father. It wasn’t a request. Not when they were at the Dragonpit with Syrax fully saddled and ready to be mounted.   King Viserys knew this day would come. He was heartbroken but relieved for this war between him and his daughter would soon come to an end. He couldn’t handle the pressure from his councilors anymore nor bear another venomous argument with her. At least this way it could be covered as diplomacy and she’d be out of his hair. At least this way there was a chance she’d still answer his letters.   “Go my only daughter. Do what you must. I give you my blessing” he said. And for the first time since Aemma died she ran to him with a hug. Of course he cried. They both did.   –  On the other side of the Red Keep Alicent bounced Aegon on her knee. The boy was strangely sullen today. Rhaenyra had came by last night to say goodbye had smiled like she used to when Alicent cried for her to stay and reassured her that this was for the best. Rhaenyra had looked at her and harkened back to the days when they were girls and talked of adventure. Her words dripped with warmth and nostalgia childhood promises fulfilled but Alicent couldn’t help notice that by moonlight her teeth almost looked sharp. She thought of that day with Aegon and gods forgive her she hoped something tragic would befall Rhaenyra on her travels so she wouldn’t have to think about any of this anymore.   Suddenly a figure blotted through the skyline.   Aegon started to wail.   ch 2,2024-07-11 23:44:45 GMT

A fluffy oneshot with no plot whatsoever following Aeron’s love confession.   Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 5 Part 6  Warnings: tooth-rotting fluff with no plot. I embarrassed myself writing this 😂. Elizabeth loves The Princess Bride which inspired this so I’m blaming her. Swearing. Female reader. I don’t think there’s anything else.   “Where are we going Aeron?” Y/N laughed excitedly as Aeron eagerly pulled her along. Aeron was sure no sweeter sound existed and he half turned to smile at her without slowing his pace picnic basket swinging precariously in his free hand. He’d immediately whisked the basket of provisions from Y/N before kissing her in greeting grateful for her thoughtfulness. “You’ll see be patient my love.” He delighted to see the blush that arouse on Y/N’s cheeks each time he used that particular term of endearment confirmation that he must affect her as she affected him.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Tugging gently on her hand as Y/N trailed behind him Aeron wove through the underbrush carefully moving rogue branches out of Y/N’s way to reveal a concealed pathway Y/N was surprised she had never seen before. At her quizzical look a ghost of a smile spread across Aeron’s face. “Samwell and I came across it the other day. I think you’ll like where it leads” he finished cryptically with a sly look. Y/n’ eyes widened in alarm prompting Aeron to look around for the source of her distress before pulling his eyes back to hers. “If Samwell was even remotely involved I’m not sure how safe this can be.” Aeron took hold of both Y/N’s hands pressing them gently before leaning down to place a soft kiss to her forehead. “You can trust that I would never put you in harm’s way you are precious to me beyond all measure. Though Sam is admittedly an imp and not too be trusted.” Y/N adjusted her hold on Aeron’s hands to place them on her waist moving hers to his shoulders instead. “I jest Aeron I trust you.” Aeron’s mouth quirked back up buoyed by her faith in him to protect her. “Good then let’s forget about Sam and continue on.”   The knight and his lady followed the path for just under a mile Aeron taking hold of Y/N’s hand as it started to lead them downhill until they reached the bank of a brook. Y/N looked up at Aeron confused “is this what you’d intended to show me Aeron?”  Aeron chuckled his eyes glittering with mirth. “No although it is a pretty brook indeed. What I wish to show you is just across the water. There’s a large tree trunk hat bridges the crossing we can get across over there.&quot; He pointed several yards away Y/N following along after him as he started towards it. Grabbing the sleeve of his tunic she brought him to a standstill just before they reached the log. Admittedly it was wide and seemed sturdy enough to bear the weight of a person but Y/N’s dress and shoes were not the most practical for ambling along a fallen tree trunk. She silently prayed to the gods that she wouldn’t embarass herself by falling in the brook in front of Aeron. &quot;My gown doesn’t lend itself to balance I’m afraid you’ll have to help me walk across and promise to fish me out should I fall in.” A look of horror crossed Aeron’s face at Y/N’s request which was only half-joking as he began spluttering out a string of almost incomprehensible sentences. “Did you think? That I’d actually ask you to. Absolutely not! I promise you I thought this through entirely. I had it all worked out!” Not understanding where Aeron’s alarm was coming from Y/N cupped both Aeron’s cheeks softly brushing her lips against his not quite a kiss but enough to halt his ramblings. “Now calmly tell me what you’d thought through?”   Aeron’s expression turned somewhat sheepish his eyes flitting between her his boots and a nearby tree. “It would only be if it was agreeable to you and you do not have to feel obliged. I would not want you to feel pressured in any way.”   “You’re still rambling Aeron and you’re starting to sound like your incorrigible idiot of a cousin Edmund.” Y/N snorted trying to ease Aeron’s nerves which had set him to stuttering as if they were back in that Banquet Hall several moons ago when he could barely string a sentence together in front of her. They’d always been able to have a good laugh about Edmund the simpering peacock of a Bracken who constantly teased Aeron’s favourite cousin a quiet girl with her nose always in a book about knights and princesses. Aeron took a deep breath through his nose and straightened his back rallying himself for whatever he was about to say. She wondered briefly if she should be concerned for his mental wellbeing. “I had thought I might carry you across if you permit it.” His eyes suddenly bore into Y/N’s and she felt her cheeks begin to burn at the notion of Aeron carrying her in his arms and her blush only further deepened when she fully registered that he’d wanted to. Aeron groaned and threw his hands up. “There now I have embarassed you. I am an oaf I admit it.”   Y/N quickly reached for Aeron pulling him back towards her willing herself to be bold when she felt oddly timid and shy at his suggestion. “Would it not make it very difficult for you to cross safely with me hindering you?” Aeron gaped equal parts surprised and gladdened that Y/N seemed amenable to his plan opening his mouth and closing it several times before speaking. “You would be no burden at all to me.” Y/N felt her heart flutter at his words. “And you promise not to drop me?” Y/N tried to add mirth to her tone but it was a genuine concern. Aeron brushed the back of his right hand against the side of her face before tucking a tendril of hair behind her ear. “I give you my word that I will never drop you.” Y/N gulped. Her legs felt like jelly from his sweet words and they’d have to make a success of it as she was convinced she would certainly fall headfirst should she attempt to make the crossing on her own now. Aeron cleared his throat then placing their picnic basket down on the ground to collect afterwards and held his arms out to her. “If you could place your arms about my neck…”   Y/N awkwardly shuffled over and wrapped her arms around Aeron as he’d instructed waiting for him to take the next step. Placing an arm around her back he gracefully leant down to swoop her up by the backs of her knees before pulling her close to his chest. Y/N’s arms instinctively tightened around Aeron from the loss of contact with the ground and as he started to walk across the fallen trunk she began clinging onto him in earnest catching his smile in response.      Gently setting Y/N down on the bank the other side of the brook Aeron ran to retrieve their basket. The path resumed a couple of paces from the edge of the bank before it began to open up into a clearing whereupon Y/N understood what Aeron had been so eager to show her since that morning. The meadow he had brought her too was vast and bedecked with Baby&#x27;s Breath flowers. Blades of sunlight cast a golden glow over the flowers and an unseasonably warm breeze blew gently throughout the meadow. By the way Y/N’s lips parted in awe Aeron understood that his surprise had had the desired effect.   He loved the way that Y/N’s eyes shone with delight each time he would bring her a fresh bunch of flowers from the small patch they’d found as children in these same woods. Now he could give her a meadow of flowers. He stayed a pace back from the opening of the clearing with his hands clasped behind his back to watch Y/N’s reaction to his offering. The gentle sounds of nature had little appeal to Aeron not the singsong chirping of birds or the gurgling of the rushing water of the nearby brook. The sound of Y/N’s laughter as she twirled in her meadow her dress billowing out around her was the only one he cared to hear. Amused by her antics Aeron swiftly bounded up to y/N taking hold of her waist with one hand and capturing her small hand in his other sweeping her into a dance with him. Coming to a stop when they both started to stumble with dizziness Y/N placed her hands on Aeron’s elbows in an attempt to steady them both. “I Love it Aeron thank you” she spoke earnestly tenderly brushing loose hairs back from his face as she often did just to feel the softness of it and watch his eyes flutter closed st her touch.   Hours later when the sun was just beginning to set Aeron was gently grazing his hand over Y/N’s ribcage over the soft fabric of her dress as they lay side by side his golden cloak laid out beneath them. As Aeron cotentedly gazed upon her delicate features Y/N leant down over him to brush her lips against his. Aeron’s hands came flying up to pull her flush against him one hand tangling in her hair the other pulling her across his torso by her waist as he crashed his lips more fully into hers deepening the kiss. There was nothing Aeron loved more than kissing Y/N. Ever since the fateful day he’d rescued her from those bastard Blackwood Knights when he’d first kissed her he’d been like a man starved for oxygen almost driven to distraction by the desire to feel her soft lips on his again and again. Gently turning them over Aeron braced himself on his elbow so as not to crush her one hand splayed across Y/N’s torso. Breaking contact to allow her to catch her breath he placed tender kisses along the edge of her jaw before recapturing her lips with his own feeling her smile against his lips as she toyed with his hair.   A few moments later Aeron felt Y/N lightly push against his chest immediately pulling away. “Are you well my heart have I made you uncomfortable?” He asked anxiously. Y/N pulled herself into a sitting position patting Aeron on the chest. “I am well my love but the hour grows late and my father will be worried. We should head back.” Aeron felt his face redden and his body heat as Y/N placed an affectionate kiss on the tip of his nose before she disentangled herself from his arms to stand straightening her skirts. Aeron swiftly followed interlocking their fingers together as they walked back from whence they’d come. “Will you come to watch me in the training yard tomorrow?” He asked eager to have his lady love cheer him from the sidelines of the knights’ training yard as she often did of late. He had never been so dedicated to the sword and his duties as a knight but they granted him endless opportunities to impress Y/N who swung their joined hands to and fro as they walked. “Of course a lady should support her knight after all.” Aeron removed his hand from Y/N’s hand to wrap it around her waist pressing her against his side wanting to be closer to her and to express his gratitude for her unfaltering support.   Carrying Y/N back over the log that bridged the brook an empty picnic basket dangling from his elbow Aeron felt the happiest he ever had. He was finding a place for himself as a knight beginning to feel that he truly did belong in the order. The Blackwoods had been surprisingly quiet with very few disputes on the borders of late. For this he was grateful for he’d become aware of his favourite cousin’s concerning penchant for dissappearing to her own Brackentree dangerously close to Blackwood lands. His Lord Uncle had made no further mention of betrothing him to a Tully girl since the day he’d stormed from his halls and he was quite sure he’d forgotten the whole matter. Above all else he now held the girl he loved in his arms her head resting against his shoulder nose brushing his neck and his heart was warmed by her trust in him.  @lovebabe18 @poppyflower-22 @ithilwen-blackwood @spinachtz @lady-callisto @twistytimesandthoughts @abookloverlawyerfan-blog @mymoonempress,2024-07-12 01:51:39 GMT

2,House of the Dragon,['asoiaf'],theredpharaoah,This implies that they have to “inherit” a dragon riding ability directly from a parent. Was this just them or GRRM too? Cuz he’s quoted in the beginning of the book. If it is the case this explains why the ability to ride a dragon seems to diminish the further you get from the original Targaryen ancestor. For most Targaryens at this stage the Dragon riding “gene” would be there regardless of whether it’s used or not. Daella would’ve had it because both Jaehaerys and Alysanne were riders. So Aemma would’ve had it and obviously Viserys would’ve had it. But my question is does it not being used diminish or lessen the ability of a child to ride or does it not matter as long as they keep the blood “pure”? Personally I have always thought it was a combination of blood and mentality.      I also love how they approached the “do dragons die of old age?” question.,2024-07-12 01:35:07 GMT

Perhaps your death will be less peaceful perhaps it will be bloody but you hope that whatever gods watched over you were not the merciless ones Queen Alicent Hightower often wept too.  The world is silent your room is quiet and you know the sun will shine soon. Not that the sun has ever done anything good for you. Most people fear the dark but forget all the snakes who love to bask in the sun’s light. You often find yourself surrounded by those very snakes but now sitting alone in your chambers on Dragonstone you wonder if the sun purposefully evades the gloomy island. Your lady’s smooth voice accompanies the squeak of your door opening.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; “Darling girl I hoped we could talk before our departure.” Princess Rhaenyra hardly asked for company; she was surrounded by people at all times whether that be her children her lovers or her court. When she wanted to speak with someone it was an honor that few could refuse. She moves to sit beside you. Her nightgown is sheer and delicate with its lacey decorations pooling at her feet as she lifts them onto your bed.  “I was worried that this trip may take a toll on you” Rhaenyra whispers when she is finally sitting at your side “If you want to stay back I am sure my father would understand.” The silence speaks for itself when Rhaenyra finally hears the irony of her words.  When has Viserys ever been understanding of you? Though the two of you were cousins his age made him dismissive and ignorant of your plight as a young woman while his gender gave him a sense of superiority that oozed from his every word. Rhaenyra was lucky to be his eldest daughter because she alone was immune to his cruelty.  “Viserys has been asking me to return and now he demands it. Even you cannot protect me from that.” The older woman’s eyes soften at your cynical words. Your arrival at court was unfortunately amidst a troubling time for House Targaryen. The Princess and the Queen were constantly at odds and it seemed that their children were following in their footsteps. With the court jester banished and the king’s mood souring you made for a perfect scapegoat. Had your mother Saera been living she would never have allowed your humiliation. But she was gone and her reputation fell like an anchor on your head.  “For the past four years I have found any excuse to keep us on Dragonstone. First it was my pregnancies then Daemon’s injury and Luke’s sickness. I am sorry that my father was not kind to you. However he has grown ill and his mind has been sullied with milk of the poppy. All my father wants is to see his family again. We have missed four of his birthdays and I fear there may not be another. We will leave at dawn.” Rhaenyra left no room for argument so you let the discussion drop. Your mind returns to the reason you must sail for the Red Keep.  “The boat ride will take longer than Dragonback. I may miss dinner entirely.” You warn Rhaenyra as she prepares to leave your bed chamber. She turns then the realms delight with the brightest smile you had ever seen as she laughed “There is more than enough room for you on Syrax.” Then she left as the sun seeped in through your windows.  • • • • • • •  In the end you refuse to ride on Dragonback. You have declined it during all the years you have lived in Westeros. The boat ride is hardly uncomfortable but as you watch Syrax’s daisy-colored form fly over you you wonder about the freedom you miss. Occasionally the Velaryon boys will fly their dragons down closer toward the water and your boat shakes at the power of their dragons’ flapping wings. Even young dragons have that power. During the journey Rhaenyra and her family split from you as they head towards King’s Landing and for a while you are left with only yourself and the Princesses’ other ladies as company. “Sit down Princess. Join us in crafting our favors. You will become seasick if you stand so much.” Elinda Massey lectures as you stand staring out the window of the old ship.  Elinda with her dark hair and darker eyes never fails to worry. She awoke in the morning with worries and every night; she went to sleep worrying about how much Rhaenyra and her children ate at dinner and whether or not they would be starving. Her worries for the royal family also extend to you; even the old king’s exiled granddaughter was worth her many troubles. Despite being your age and both of you being the youngest of Rhaenyra’s ladies Elinda had a pious nature that led to her acting as a mother for the other girls yourself included.  “Lady Massey I can assure you I will be fine standing. The ship should dock soon anyway.” Elinda frowned at your response but she knew better than to argue with you when your mind was made.  You hurry to the deck of the ship hoping to see King’s Landing in all its glory when your eye is caught by the enormous shadow that hovers above your boat. A dragon as dark as an emerald and as giant as the Dragonpit flies above you with a slow flap of its wings. Vhagar you think you knew that dragon by heart and the old beast had not changed in the years since you left. Her rider may not be on her back but you feel like he is for a second his eyes piercing you from a place hidden from your view. Myranda Strong with her twin Alyssa approaches you from behind.  “Lady Massey is talking to the captain. The princess will send us a carriage but we will still need someone to bring our luggage.” Myranda tells you as her eyes also lift to watch Vhagar. Alyssa ignores the dragon focused on the men preparing to moor the ship.  True to her word Rhaenyra has sent a carriage for the four of you. It is grander than most carriages but still simple enough in its design to reflect your status as ladies-in-waiting. Inside the carriage you bump into Alyssa at every dip in the road but she merely smiles. “The men of the Red Keep will be a great exchange for those in DragonStone. New faces are just the change I need.” She laughs with you as you agree to her lust-filled words. “It is the eldest prince that I am most excited to see. The rumors say that were he not a prince; he would certainly be the lover of a Lysinian mistress or worse a madame.” You go silent at her words but Elinda quiets the other girl.  “I can assure you we will not be anywhere near the drunkard prince.” Her words are brusque and they silence Alyssa for the rest of the ride. The silence is deafening until the other strong girl finds her voice. “Where is Saagael my princess?” Myranda asks you even though her dark eyes are locked on her sister. You cannot stop your smile at the mention of your beloved pet. “He will be brought with our luggage. I had to cage him for the journey so the Hand would not know his presence. Saagael is not supposed to be here.” You whisper the words with delight as you discuss how you have snuck your cat into King’s Landing. Your company finds humor in this but the rest of the ride is silent until the carriage doors open and Rhaenyra takes your hand to help you step safely onto the dirt.  “My Princess! You did not need to come get us.” Lady Massey exclaims in delight as Rhaenyra helps her down as well. “I thought that at least the four of you should receive a warm welcome. It seems that courtesy is not felt amongst the court.” Rhaenyra sneers before she links your arms and leads you through the halls of the red keep. In the light of the setting sun the halls look more burgundy than the bright red they are known for. Rhaenyra is silent as you both walk arm-in-arm through the bustling castle.  Servants nobles and knights alike stop to stare at the Heir and the formerly exiled princess. It has been many years since the Realm’s Delight has been home. They watch her with curious glances trying to dissect this new woman who walks amongst them. Has the Realm’s delight turned cruel or does she remain the sweet girl beloved by all? You can see the hesitance in their eyes as they bow to her passing figure. Rhaenyra for the most part ignores all the attention as she begins to tell you what has transpired today.  “A meager servant was sent to greet us. Our first homecoming in five years and we are treated like mere ambassadors. However I believe that even ambassadors are treated better. I expected to see my father upon my return but the king is not currently receiving company. Otto Hightower has practically barred the doors to my father’s chambers. ” The princess can’t help but ramble. It is something she often does in your company for whatever reason. You think it is because despite her estrangement from her siblings she craves a relationship of equals rather than one of husband and wife or mother and child. She has always been alone in ways her sons and husband never have. The thought tugs at your heartstrings and your grip on her arm tightens. “I am sure he will be at the tourney. It is in his name is it not?” You try to ease her stress but when it is time for you to go to your chambers Rhaenyra keeps her hold on you.  “Will you stay with me? Your support would make this whole thing feel easier.” Silence fills the halls outside of your chamber. Her Majesty Queen Alicent chose the room assigned to you. It is within a forgotten tower just behind the Royal sept the only chamber completely secluded. Unlike the towers that occupy the hand and the royal guard which all contain more than one room your tower has only one other room relatively distant from your chambers. The royal library is at the end of the hall and one must pass your rooms to get there. Thus for the most part your halls are silent. Rhaenyra uses this silence to talk freely so you do the same.  “My Princess the children of Her Majesty will also be in attendance. I hardly think I will be any help when I am already so anxious to see them. I haven’t been here since Helaena disappeared.” You pick at the skin around your nails a habit inherited from your mother Saera. Rhaenyra watches you look away from her gaze while shuffling uncomfortably back and forth. Aegon and Aemond Targaryen were your friends once more Aegon than Aemond. But the night Helaena vanished many incidents occurred that forced you to flee for DragonStone. Not only had Alicent suspected you of helping Helaena escape but so did her two oldest sons and when you left never to return until now they grew to resent you. That’s what you thought although you never had any clear evidence besides the heated conversation that night four years ago.  “Darling I want you there but I will not beg” Rhaenyra stated plainly. Her royal demeanor inspired you to lift your eyes. Her violet eyes gleamed with a reserved strength that she took no measures to conceal. “I will go.” You decided.  • • • • • • •  The tourney was to begin in less than an hour but first you wanted to make sure your pet was settling into your chambers. Saagael paced back and forth his body more extensive than a house cat as dark as a moonless night sky and his paws hit the floor like an elephant on the march. “I didn’t want to leave you alone.” You try to reason with the cat but he will hear nothing of it. He turns to leap onto your chair making it seem like a doll’s chair with his big body taking over the furniture. His paws knead into the soft fabric but he does not rip it. You knew the risk of returning him to the red keep would be significant but you reasoned that he would be safer with you than left alone on Dragonstone. At least here you could watch him and protect him. The thought of losing your beloved companion was one of the many fears that kept you up at night. Saagael was all you had left of home and your parents; without him you would be truly lost. Even in moments like this when his attitude was at its height you took comfort in his presence.  “Fine. I will bring you a whole salmon from the kitchen! All you have to do is stay here and be good.” You pleaded with the grumpy cat. Saagael’s ears perked up at the mention of his favorite treat. Finally he left his chair to curl up at your feet. You scratched his neck making him purr contentedly. With a few more pets you got up to leave him. As you opened your door you jumped back in shock at the sight of Alicent Hightower standing outside. Her delicate hand was raised as if she was going to knock upon your door. The both of you seemed startled by the presence of the other but neither of you spoke for a moment.  Alicent breaks the silence “You have grown quite a lot in these years.” Her voice is gentle but still royal showing her hesitance to appear as anything but regal in front of you. “Please do come in your majesty!” You stumble over yourself to bow appropriately in the older woman’s presence. Alicent walks in taking in the room to find it the same as when she first had it decorated for you.  Saagael is perched on the bed with no interest in moving but Alicent strokes his fur and he suddenly sits up and is very interested in the queen. “Is there a purpose to your visit my queen?” Slowly your feet move to the Queen’s side while watching her admire your beloved Saagael. “My father hates this cat.” The queen muses instead of answering your question. The room falls to silence again until Alicent finally speaks. “I have been begging Viserys to bring you back home and finally you are here. I came to apologize to you dear girl. When my daughter…left…I placed my blame onto you when you have been nothing but loyal to me and my children since you arrived at the Red Keep. I hope you can forgive me.” She turns to you and you see the young woman you grew up with who took you in along with Rhaenyra when you needed guidance.  Her big brown eyes glisten with unshed tears but over time you realize that Alicent’s eyes are always sad. With a boldness you didn’t realize you had you step forward to grasp the Queen’s hands. “All is forgiven Your Majesty.” Alicent smiles as she rubs her hand over your own pausing at the rough skin around your fingernails. It is inflamed from being picked at and Alicent notices it instantly. Gently she touches your skin before looking back into your eyes.  “My sons they have missed you greatly. I know they will be glad to see you. Please forgive them of their standoffish nature.” You nod at her words knowing you have missed her sons just as much as Helaena. A bell chimes from the royal sept and its echo fills your quiet room. Alicent responds instantly dropping your hands and heading to the door before turning and saying “The king wants his entire family at dinner after the tourney. I hope that you come.” She leaves the room with urgency and for a fleeting moment you feel like a twelve-year-old again spending the winter in the Red Keep playing with Helaena and Aegon while a silent Aemond watches on in Amusement as Alicent gently scolds you and Aegon for roughhousing.  Jace and Luke are the ones who come to escort you to the King’s birthday tourney. You link arms with Jacaerys while Luke fiddles with the ring on his finger. It is a matching one Rhaenyra gave him for his tenth name day valyrian steel with a single onyx crystal in the middle of the circlet. You all walk in silence having nothing to say to each other. When you reach the doors that lead into the courtyard you stop to turn to Luke who is beginning to look faint. “Luke you look as though you have seen a ghost. What troubles you?” You rest your hand over his own to stop his fidgeting. Luke smiles at you even though his eyebrows furrow in thought. Jace keeps his hand on your arm but uses his other hand to pat Luke’s back. Then Luke looks up at you with a strange determination on his face. “Are you on our side?” You drop his hands in shock. With a quick glance around you see that nobody is in the halls besides two guards who stand watch at the doors to the courtyard. You gather the skirts of your dress and bend slightly to come face to face with Luke.  “Little Luke Velaryon what are you talking about?” The words come out as a whisper unnoticed by the guards but Jace and Luke hear them loud and clear and they do not back down. “Our uncles call us bastards. The whispers of the court say that it is Aegon who should be our grandsire’s heir. Do you stand with us or with them?”  Luke is bolder than Jace. He always has been. Unlike Jacaerys who strives to be the perfect dignified gentle-lord Luke is proud like the Velaryons and does not hold his tongue.  “I am my mother’s daughter; Saera Targaryen would see no value in such disagreements. I do not wish to fuel a fire that is already roaring. The politics of Westeros are still strange to me but my position here is not. I have no right to say what should happen to the iron throne but I assure you that I love you and your mother very much. That is all I can say.” Luke nods his youthful face looking mature for the first time. He seems as if he will argue but he holds his tongue because of a lack of response. Jace takes your arm in his again and as you wait for Rhaenyra and Daemon to join the three of you Jace talks to you in whispers.  “Even you must feel the division of the court.” He shows no signs of discontent but Lucereys is still mulling over your response. “Trust that I feel the division like a knife in my back.” Your stare rises to meet his eyes. For a moment he is silent but his eyes are loud enough. The conversation ends there as Rhaenyra and Daemon approach to lead the family to their carriages. You watch the doors open but stop before crossing them; Jace pulls you through.  • • • • • • •,2024-07-12 02:48:04 GMT

A child with Targaryen characteristics with a free and charming personality. For her first seven years of life she was in the skirts of her sister Rhaenyra Targaryen following her everywhere. After the years she became attached to her father Viserys who together with him performed readings late at night however everything changed after the death of a loved one.   The young girl who smiled at all times and whose laughter could be heard through all the walls the girl who represented the joy of the castle disappeared in the days following the death of her mother Aemma.         There was still something left of the little girl no doubt when you see her you can see that she welcomes you with a smile apart from also that her bravery and strength have increased after the long walks with her dragon Vermithor. After seeing how her father married Alicent Hightower there was no longer much communication with Viserys because the princess still could not believe that her father had married someone else; this made her more attached to her sister Rhaenyra.  But no one could deny that that young woman who represented the joy of the castle had become an exquisite and beautiful woman; her beauty attracted several men from different houses who all knew her as “the Valyrian delicacy”. However Daella was not attentive to these but was interested in reading and battles a hobby she had from her uncle Daemon where even sometimes they both went on small surveillance missions.  She was always by her sister Rhaenyra’s side but she never expected that after the birth of her half-sister Helaena she would meet someone who would have the same interests as her.

A fluffy oneshot with no plot whatsoever following Aeron’s love confession.   Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 5 Part 6  Warnings: tooth-rotting fluff with no plot. I embarrassed myself writing this 😂. Elizabeth loves The Princess Bride which inspired this so I’m blaming her. Swearing. Female reader. I don’t think there’s anything else.   “Where are we going Aeron?” Y/N laughed excitedly as Aeron eagerly pulled her along. Aeron was sure no sweeter sound existed and he half turned to smile at her without slowing his pace picnic basket swinging precariously in his free hand. He’d immediately whisked the basket of provisions from Y/N before kissing her in greeting grateful for her thoughtfulness. “You’ll see be patient my love.” He delighted to see the blush that arouse on Y/N’s cheeks each time he used that particular term of endearment confirmation that he must affect her as she affected him.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Tugging gently on her hand as Y/N trailed behind him Aeron wove through the underbrush carefully moving rogue branches out of Y/N’s way to reveal a concealed pathway Y/N was surprised she had never seen before. At her quizzical look a ghost of a smile spread across Aeron’s face. “Samwell and I came across it the other day. I think you’ll like where it leads” he finished cryptically with a sly look. Y/n’ eyes widened in alarm prompting Aeron to look around for the source of her distress before pulling his eyes back to hers. “If Samwell was even remotely involved I’m not sure how safe this can be.” Aeron took hold of both Y/N’s hands pressing them gently before leaning down to place a soft kiss to her forehead. “You can trust that I would never put you in harm’s way you are precious to me beyond all measure. Though Sam is admittedly an imp and not too be trusted.” Y/N adjusted her hold on Aeron’s hands to place them on her waist moving hers to his shoulders instead. “I jest Aeron I trust you.” Aeron’s mouth quirked back up buoyed by her faith in him to protect her. “Good then let’s forget about Sam and continue on.”   The knight and his lady followed the path for just under a mile Aeron taking hold of Y/N’s hand as it started to lead them downhill until they reached the bank of a brook. Y/N looked up at Aeron confused “is this what you’d intended to show me Aeron?”  Aeron chuckled his eyes glittering with mirth. “No although it is a pretty brook indeed. What I wish to show you is just across the water. There’s a large tree trunk hat bridges the crossing we can get across over there.&quot; He pointed several yards away Y/N following along after him as he started towards it. Grabbing the sleeve of his tunic she brought him to a standstill just before they reached the log. Admittedly it was wide and seemed sturdy enough to bear the weight of a person but Y/N’s dress and shoes were not the most practical for ambling along a fallen tree trunk. She silently prayed to the gods that she wouldn’t embarass herself by falling in the brook in front of Aeron. &quot;My gown doesn’t lend itself to balance I’m afraid you’ll have to help me walk across and promise to fish me out should I fall in.” A look of horror crossed Aeron’s face at Y/N’s request which was only half-joking as he began spluttering out a string of almost incomprehensible sentences. “Did you think? That I’d actually ask you to. Absolutely not! I promise you I thought this through entirely. I had it all worked out!” Not understanding where Aeron’s alarm was coming from Y/N cupped both Aeron’s cheeks softly brushing her lips against his not quite a kiss but enough to halt his ramblings. “Now calmly tell me what you’d thought through?”   Aeron’s expression turned somewhat sheepish his eyes flitting between her his boots and a nearby tree. “It would only be if it was agreeable to you and you do not have to feel obliged. I would not want you to feel pressured in any way.”   “You’re still rambling Aeron and you’re starting to sound like your incorrigible idiot of a cousin Edmund.” Y/N snorted trying to ease Aeron’s nerves which had set him to stuttering as if they were back in that Banquet Hall several moons ago when he could barely string a sentence together in front of her. They’d always been able to have a good laugh about Edmund the simpering peacock of a Bracken who constantly teased Aeron’s favourite cousin a quiet girl with her nose always in a book about knights and princesses. Aeron took a deep breath through his nose and straightened his back rallying himself for whatever he was about to say. She wondered briefly if she should be concerned for his mental wellbeing. “I had thought I might carry you across if you permit it.” His eyes suddenly bore into Y/N’s and she felt her cheeks begin to burn at the notion of Aeron carrying her in his arms and her blush only further deepened when she fully registered that he’d wanted to. Aeron groaned and threw his hands up. “There now I have embarassed you. I am an oaf I admit it.”   Y/N quickly reached for Aeron pulling him back towards her willing herself to be bold when she felt oddly timid and shy at his suggestion. “Would it not make it very difficult for you to cross safely with me hindering you?” Aeron gaped equal parts surprised and gladdened that Y/N seemed amenable to his plan opening his mouth and closing it several times before speaking. “You would be no burden at all to me.” Y/N felt her heart flutter at his words. “And you promise not to drop me?” Y/N tried to add mirth to her tone but it was a genuine concern. Aeron brushed the back of his right hand against the side of her face before tucking a tendril of hair behind her ear. “I give you my word that I will never drop you.” Y/N gulped. Her legs felt like jelly from his sweet words and they’d have to make a success of it as she was convinced she would certainly fall headfirst should she attempt to make the crossing on her own now. Aeron cleared his throat then placing their picnic basket down on the ground to collect afterwards and held his arms out to her. “If you could place your arms about my neck…”   Y/N awkwardly shuffled over and wrapped her arms around Aeron as he’d instructed waiting for him to take the next step. Placing an arm around her back he gracefully leant down to swoop her up by the backs of her knees before pulling her close to his chest. Y/N’s arms instinctively tightened around Aeron from the loss of contact with the ground and as he started to walk across the fallen trunk she began clinging onto him in earnest catching his smile in response.      Gently setting Y/N down on the bank the other side of the brook Aeron ran to retrieve their basket. The path resumed a couple of paces from the edge of the bank before it began to open up into a clearing whereupon Y/N understood what Aeron had been so eager to show her since that morning. The meadow he had brought her too was vast and bedecked with Baby&#x27;s Breath flowers. Blades of sunlight cast a golden glow over the flowers and an unseasonably warm breeze blew gently throughout the meadow. By the way Y/N’s lips parted in awe Aeron understood that his surprise had had the desired effect.   He loved the way that Y/N’s eyes shone with delight each time he would bring her a fresh bunch of flowers from the small patch they’d found as children in these same woods. Now he could give her a meadow of flowers. He stayed a pace back from the opening of the clearing with his hands clasped behind his back to watch Y/N’s reaction to his offering. The gentle sounds of nature had little appeal to Aeron not the singsong chirping of birds or the gurgling of the rushing water of the nearby brook. The sound of Y/N’s laughter as she twirled in her meadow her dress billowing out around her was the only one he cared to hear. Amused by her antics Aeron swiftly bounded up to y/N taking hold of her waist with one hand and capturing her small hand in his other sweeping her into a dance with him. Coming to a stop when they both started to stumble with dizziness Y/N placed her hands on Aeron’s elbows in an attempt to steady them both. “I Love it Aeron thank you” she spoke earnestly tenderly brushing loose hairs back from his face as she often did just to feel the softness of it and watch his eyes flutter closed st her touch.   Hours later when the sun was just beginning to set Aeron was gently grazing his hand over Y/N’s ribcage over the soft fabric of her dress as they lay side by side his golden cloak laid out beneath them. As Aeron cotentedly gazed upon her delicate features Y/N leant down over him to brush her lips against his. Aeron’s hands came flying up to pull her flush against him one hand tangling in her hair the other pulling her across his torso by her waist as he crashed his lips more fully into hers deepening the kiss. There was nothing Aeron loved more than kissing Y/N. Ever since the fateful day he’d rescued her from those bastard Blackwood Knights when he’d first kissed her he’d been like a man starved for oxygen almost driven to distraction by the desire to feel her soft lips on his again and again. Gently turning them over Aeron braced himself on his elbow so as not to crush her one hand splayed across Y/N’s torso. Breaking contact to allow her to catch her breath he placed tender kisses along the edge of her jaw before recapturing her lips with his own feeling her smile against his lips as she toyed with his hair.   A few moments later Aeron felt Y/N lightly push against his chest immediately pulling away. “Are you well my heart have I made you uncomfortable?” He asked anxiously. Y/N pulled herself into a sitting position patting Aeron on the chest. “I am well my love but the hour grows late and my father will be worried. We should head back.” Aeron felt his face redden and his body heat as Y/N placed an affectionate kiss on the tip of his nose before she disentangled herself from his arms to stand straightening her skirts. Aeron swiftly followed interlocking their fingers together as they walked back from whence they’d come. “Will you come to watch me in the training yard tomorrow?” He asked eager to have his lady love cheer him from the sidelines of the knights’ training yard as she often did of late. He had never been so dedicated to the sword and his duties as a knight but they granted him endless opportunities to impress Y/N who swung their joined hands to and fro as they walked. “Of course a lady should support her knight after all.” Aeron removed his hand from Y/N’s hand to wrap it around her waist pressing her against his side wanting to be closer to her and to express his gratitude for her unfaltering support.   Carrying Y/N back over the log that bridged the brook an empty picnic basket dangling from his elbow Aeron felt the happiest he ever had. He was finding a place for himself as a knight beginning to feel that he truly did belong in the order. The Blackwoods had been surprisingly quiet with very few disputes on the borders of late. For this he was grateful for he’d become aware of his favourite cousin’s concerning penchant for dissappearing to her own Brackentree dangerously close to Blackwood lands. His Lord Uncle had made no further mention of betrothing him to a Tully girl since the day he’d stormed from his halls and he was quite sure he’d forgotten the whole matter. Above all else he now held the girl he loved in his arms her head resting against his shoulder nose brushing his neck and his heart was warmed by her trust in him.  @lovebabe18 @poppyflower-22 @ithilwen-blackwood @spinachtz @lady-callisto @twistytimesandthoughts @abookloverlawyerfan-blog @mymoonempress,2024-07-12 01:51:39 GMT

13,House of the Dragon,['asoiaf'  'a song of ice and fire'  'house of the dragon spoilers'  'nettles'],kemihaydeestantonva,OKAY I get mad at people for reading too much into statements by George RR Martin but I’ve been talking about this idea of Rhaena having an arc in the Vale where she tries and fails to tame Sheepstealer - essentially a fakeout before introducing us to Nettles in S3. I think this would be a good change for the twins as they weren’t given much to do in the books and Rhaena is in this low place in her arc where she is really feeling useless and helpless. Failing to tame a wild dragon would be a nice dramatic rock bottom before the hatching of Morning which will be uplifting and hopeful at the end of a hopeless time.     George just made a blog post talking about the differences between his dragons and other dragons in fiction. Aside from being very miffed about the heraldry showing dragons with 4 legs (me too George me too bestie fr) he makes a point to talk about how dragons nest. Wild dragons in Westeros stay near Dragonstone. That’s where they nest. They aren’t nomadic they don’t go settle down elsewhere otherwise the whole of Westeros would have dragons just cruising around doing whatever.     I don’t want to put words in the guy’s mouth because everybody already does that and it’s agitating af but I couldn’t help but feel like he brought this up for a reason. Like I believe George when he says he is very happy with HotD and he’s still loosely involved in the writing process they still consult him on things ect. But if they put Sheepstealer in the Vale that might be a change he isn’t a fan of. Because wild dragons according to him wouldn’t BE in the Vale. (Also I suspected this beforehand due to Sheepstealer nesting in the Vale AFTER the dance specifically because Nettles and Sheepstealer went there together).     This doesn’t prove my theory correct but I’m holding out hope. I want Nettles to show up later and I want Rhaena to have a satisfying arc. I believe.,2024-07-12 03:39:34 GMT

I like how straightforward it is and how it combs episode by episode to show why adding the element of misunderstanding Viserys’s final words hurts and muddles her character arc.  People argue that she’s using Viserys’s final words as a shield to delude herself that what she’s doing is righteous but if that is the case then that minimizes every event up until then that already serves as her justification to go against Rhaenyra.   The Driftmark confrontation should have been the point when she’s committed herself to keeping Rhaenyra off the throne. By the time Viserys dies Alicent shouldn’t need to be looking for justifications to usurp Rhaenyra because the injustices Alicent perceived to have happened there should have been just that.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Her son maimed by Rhaenyra’s son and the authorities not protecting him but instead siding with her son’s aggressor? That should have been what convinced her to seize power because it showed that Rhaenyra is a danger to her and her family — that even if Rhaenyra herself wouldn’t swing the executioner’s axe the system will side with Rhaenyra over Alicent every time. And it’s unfair.  So that’s when Alicent decides to say fuck trusting the king’s wisdom and due process then. She’s done being self-sacrificing and letting Rhaenyra step over her children’s rights. Fuck the duty that she supposedly owes to her husband and his side of the family because they certainly didn’t afford that to hers. When she takes the dagger into her hands and attacks Rhaenyra she’s saying she’s done “trusting honor and decency will prevail” anymore. The system will not right the perceived wrongs Rhaenyra has done because now it’s confirmed that it’s unfairly weighted in her favor. Alicent has decided she must correct that injustice herself and tip the scales back to its established order.  If we kept with these character motivations for Alicent it would have set her up to turn into the person she despised — someone who uses their position and status to get away with breaking the rules and not caring who they hurt. It would set up her own desire being at conflict with itself when enforcing her children’s rights did not protect them and was what actually led to their deaths. It could set up the eventual realization that Rhaenyra was a misplaced target of Alicent’s resentment that Rhaenyra was never the anomaly disrupting Alicent’s precious established order that would have protected her and her family. Rhaenyra’s favoritism is the system working as it was intended to work: unfairly. And it will continue to be unfair to Alicent even after Rhaenyra has died and Aegon is installed as king.  But they instead decide to walk back all that character development. They sacrificed Alicent’s motivations on the altar of making Viserys a tragic and sympathetic character in that dinner scene. They put a full stop to her old character resentments that they built up in the first season as soon as she backed off when he made that dinner speech. Alicent from then on in just follows whatever she thinks Viserys wants even though she has no reason to be this devoted to him or loyal to his wishes.   And now that it’s revealed that she doesn’t know what Viserys wants what are we left with? If her character motivations have been forcefully shifted from “protecting and righting the wrongs done to my children” to “fulfilling Viserys’s last words” then what happens now that the latter falls apart?   Honestly what does Alicent even want now?,2024-07-12 03:20:58 GMT

Perhaps your death will be less peaceful perhaps it will be bloody but you hope that whatever gods watched over you were not the merciless ones Queen Alicent Hightower often wept too.  The world is silent your room is quiet and you know the sun will shine soon. Not that the sun has ever done anything good for you. Most people fear the dark but forget all the snakes who love to bask in the sun’s light. You often find yourself surrounded by those very snakes but now sitting alone in your chambers on Dragonstone you wonder if the sun purposefully evades the gloomy island. Your lady’s smooth voice accompanies the squeak of your door opening.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; “Darling girl I hoped we could talk before our departure.” Princess Rhaenyra hardly asked for company; she was surrounded by people at all times whether that be her children her lovers or her court. When she wanted to speak with someone it was an honor that few could refuse. She moves to sit beside you. Her nightgown is sheer and delicate with its lacey decorations pooling at her feet as she lifts them onto your bed.  “I was worried that this trip may take a toll on you” Rhaenyra whispers when she is finally sitting at your side “If you want to stay back I am sure my father would understand.” The silence speaks for itself when Rhaenyra finally hears the irony of her words.  When has Viserys ever been understanding of you? Though the two of you were cousins his age made him dismissive and ignorant of your plight as a young woman while his gender gave him a sense of superiority that oozed from his every word. Rhaenyra was lucky to be his eldest daughter because she alone was immune to his cruelty.  “Viserys has been asking me to return and now he demands it. Even you cannot protect me from that.” The older woman’s eyes soften at your cynical words. Your arrival at court was unfortunately amidst a troubling time for House Targaryen. The Princess and the Queen were constantly at odds and it seemed that their children were following in their footsteps. With the court jester banished and the king’s mood souring you made for a perfect scapegoat. Had your mother Saera been living she would never have allowed your humiliation. But she was gone and her reputation fell like an anchor on your head.  “For the past four years I have found any excuse to keep us on Dragonstone. First it was my pregnancies then Daemon’s injury and Luke’s sickness. I am sorry that my father was not kind to you. However he has grown ill and his mind has been sullied with milk of the poppy. All my father wants is to see his family again. We have missed four of his birthdays and I fear there may not be another. We will leave at dawn.” Rhaenyra left no room for argument so you let the discussion drop. Your mind returns to the reason you must sail for the Red Keep.  “The boat ride will take longer than Dragonback. I may miss dinner entirely.” You warn Rhaenyra as she prepares to leave your bed chamber. She turns then the realms delight with the brightest smile you had ever seen as she laughed “There is more than enough room for you on Syrax.” Then she left as the sun seeped in through your windows.  • • • • • • •  In the end you refuse to ride on Dragonback. You have declined it during all the years you have lived in Westeros. The boat ride is hardly uncomfortable but as you watch Syrax’s daisy-colored form fly over you you wonder about the freedom you miss. Occasionally the Velaryon boys will fly their dragons down closer toward the water and your boat shakes at the power of their dragons’ flapping wings. Even young dragons have that power. During the journey Rhaenyra and her family split from you as they head towards King’s Landing and for a while you are left with only yourself and the Princesses’ other ladies as company. “Sit down Princess. Join us in crafting our favors. You will become seasick if you stand so much.” Elinda Massey lectures as you stand staring out the window of the old ship.  Elinda with her dark hair and darker eyes never fails to worry. She awoke in the morning with worries and every night; she went to sleep worrying about how much Rhaenyra and her children ate at dinner and whether or not they would be starving. Her worries for the royal family also extend to you; even the old king’s exiled granddaughter was worth her many troubles. Despite being your age and both of you being the youngest of Rhaenyra’s ladies Elinda had a pious nature that led to her acting as a mother for the other girls yourself included.  “Lady Massey I can assure you I will be fine standing. The ship should dock soon anyway.” Elinda frowned at your response but she knew better than to argue with you when your mind was made.  You hurry to the deck of the ship hoping to see King’s Landing in all its glory when your eye is caught by the enormous shadow that hovers above your boat. A dragon as dark as an emerald and as giant as the Dragonpit flies above you with a slow flap of its wings. Vhagar you think you knew that dragon by heart and the old beast had not changed in the years since you left. Her rider may not be on her back but you feel like he is for a second his eyes piercing you from a place hidden from your view. Myranda Strong with her twin Alyssa approaches you from behind.  “Lady Massey is talking to the captain. The princess will send us a carriage but we will still need someone to bring our luggage.” Myranda tells you as her eyes also lift to watch Vhagar. Alyssa ignores the dragon focused on the men preparing to moor the ship.  True to her word Rhaenyra has sent a carriage for the four of you. It is grander than most carriages but still simple enough in its design to reflect your status as ladies-in-waiting. Inside the carriage you bump into Alyssa at every dip in the road but she merely smiles. “The men of the Red Keep will be a great exchange for those in DragonStone. New faces are just the change I need.” She laughs with you as you agree to her lust-filled words. “It is the eldest prince that I am most excited to see. The rumors say that were he not a prince; he would certainly be the lover of a Lysinian mistress or worse a madame.” You go silent at her words but Elinda quiets the other girl.  “I can assure you we will not be anywhere near the drunkard prince.” Her words are brusque and they silence Alyssa for the rest of the ride. The silence is deafening until the other strong girl finds her voice. “Where is Saagael my princess?” Myranda asks you even though her dark eyes are locked on her sister. You cannot stop your smile at the mention of your beloved pet. “He will be brought with our luggage. I had to cage him for the journey so the Hand would not know his presence. Saagael is not supposed to be here.” You whisper the words with delight as you discuss how you have snuck your cat into King’s Landing. Your company finds humor in this but the rest of the ride is silent until the carriage doors open and Rhaenyra takes your hand to help you step safely onto the dirt.  “My Princess! You did not need to come get us.” Lady Massey exclaims in delight as Rhaenyra helps her down as well. “I thought that at least the four of you should receive a warm welcome. It seems that courtesy is not felt amongst the court.” Rhaenyra sneers before she links your arms and leads you through the halls of the red keep. In the light of the setting sun the halls look more burgundy than the bright red they are known for. Rhaenyra is silent as you both walk arm-in-arm through the bustling castle.  Servants nobles and knights alike stop to stare at the Heir and the formerly exiled princess. It has been many years since the Realm’s Delight has been home. They watch her with curious glances trying to dissect this new woman who walks amongst them. Has the Realm’s delight turned cruel or does she remain the sweet girl beloved by all? You can see the hesitance in their eyes as they bow to her passing figure. Rhaenyra for the most part ignores all the attention as she begins to tell you what has transpired today.  “A meager servant was sent to greet us. Our first homecoming in five years and we are treated like mere ambassadors. However I believe that even ambassadors are treated better. I expected to see my father upon my return but the king is not currently receiving company. Otto Hightower has practically barred the doors to my father’s chambers. ” The princess can’t help but ramble. It is something she often does in your company for whatever reason. You think it is because despite her estrangement from her siblings she craves a relationship of equals rather than one of husband and wife or mother and child. She has always been alone in ways her sons and husband never have. The thought tugs at your heartstrings and your grip on her arm tightens. “I am sure he will be at the tourney. It is in his name is it not?” You try to ease her stress but when it is time for you to go to your chambers Rhaenyra keeps her hold on you.  “Will you stay with me? Your support would make this whole thing feel easier.” Silence fills the halls outside of your chamber. Her Majesty Queen Alicent chose the room assigned to you. It is within a forgotten tower just behind the Royal sept the only chamber completely secluded. Unlike the towers that occupy the hand and the royal guard which all contain more than one room your tower has only one other room relatively distant from your chambers. The royal library is at the end of the hall and one must pass your rooms to get there. Thus for the most part your halls are silent. Rhaenyra uses this silence to talk freely so you do the same.  “My Princess the children of Her Majesty will also be in attendance. I hardly think I will be any help when I am already so anxious to see them. I haven’t been here since Helaena disappeared.” You pick at the skin around your nails a habit inherited from your mother Saera. Rhaenyra watches you look away from her gaze while shuffling uncomfortably back and forth. Aegon and Aemond Targaryen were your friends once more Aegon than Aemond. But the night Helaena vanished many incidents occurred that forced you to flee for DragonStone. Not only had Alicent suspected you of helping Helaena escape but so did her two oldest sons and when you left never to return until now they grew to resent you. That’s what you thought although you never had any clear evidence besides the heated conversation that night four years ago.  “Darling I want you there but I will not beg” Rhaenyra stated plainly. Her royal demeanor inspired you to lift your eyes. Her violet eyes gleamed with a reserved strength that she took no measures to conceal. “I will go.” You decided.  • • • • • • •  The tourney was to begin in less than an hour but first you wanted to make sure your pet was settling into your chambers. Saagael paced back and forth his body more extensive than a house cat as dark as a moonless night sky and his paws hit the floor like an elephant on the march. “I didn’t want to leave you alone.” You try to reason with the cat but he will hear nothing of it. He turns to leap onto your chair making it seem like a doll’s chair with his big body taking over the furniture. His paws knead into the soft fabric but he does not rip it. You knew the risk of returning him to the red keep would be significant but you reasoned that he would be safer with you than left alone on Dragonstone. At least here you could watch him and protect him. The thought of losing your beloved companion was one of the many fears that kept you up at night. Saagael was all you had left of home and your parents; without him you would be truly lost. Even in moments like this when his attitude was at its height you took comfort in his presence.  “Fine. I will bring you a whole salmon from the kitchen! All you have to do is stay here and be good.” You pleaded with the grumpy cat. Saagael’s ears perked up at the mention of his favorite treat. Finally he left his chair to curl up at your feet. You scratched his neck making him purr contentedly. With a few more pets you got up to leave him. As you opened your door you jumped back in shock at the sight of Alicent Hightower standing outside. Her delicate hand was raised as if she was going to knock upon your door. The both of you seemed startled by the presence of the other but neither of you spoke for a moment.  Alicent breaks the silence “You have grown quite a lot in these years.” Her voice is gentle but still royal showing her hesitance to appear as anything but regal in front of you. “Please do come in your majesty!” You stumble over yourself to bow appropriately in the older woman’s presence. Alicent walks in taking in the room to find it the same as when she first had it decorated for you.  Saagael is perched on the bed with no interest in moving but Alicent strokes his fur and he suddenly sits up and is very interested in the queen. “Is there a purpose to your visit my queen?” Slowly your feet move to the Queen’s side while watching her admire your beloved Saagael. “My father hates this cat.” The queen muses instead of answering your question. The room falls to silence again until Alicent finally speaks. “I have been begging Viserys to bring you back home and finally you are here. I came to apologize to you dear girl. When my daughter…left…I placed my blame onto you when you have been nothing but loyal to me and my children since you arrived at the Red Keep. I hope you can forgive me.” She turns to you and you see the young woman you grew up with who took you in along with Rhaenyra when you needed guidance.  Her big brown eyes glisten with unshed tears but over time you realize that Alicent’s eyes are always sad. With a boldness you didn’t realize you had you step forward to grasp the Queen’s hands. “All is forgiven Your Majesty.” Alicent smiles as she rubs her hand over your own pausing at the rough skin around your fingernails. It is inflamed from being picked at and Alicent notices it instantly. Gently she touches your skin before looking back into your eyes.  “My sons they have missed you greatly. I know they will be glad to see you. Please forgive them of their standoffish nature.” You nod at her words knowing you have missed her sons just as much as Helaena. A bell chimes from the royal sept and its echo fills your quiet room. Alicent responds instantly dropping your hands and heading to the door before turning and saying “The king wants his entire family at dinner after the tourney. I hope that you come.” She leaves the room with urgency and for a fleeting moment you feel like a twelve-year-old again spending the winter in the Red Keep playing with Helaena and Aegon while a silent Aemond watches on in Amusement as Alicent gently scolds you and Aegon for roughhousing.  Jace and Luke are the ones who come to escort you to the King’s birthday tourney. You link arms with Jacaerys while Luke fiddles with the ring on his finger. It is a matching one Rhaenyra gave him for his tenth name day valyrian steel with a single onyx crystal in the middle of the circlet. You all walk in silence having nothing to say to each other. When you reach the doors that lead into the courtyard you stop to turn to Luke who is beginning to look faint. “Luke you look as though you have seen a ghost. What troubles you?” You rest your hand over his own to stop his fidgeting. Luke smiles at you even though his eyebrows furrow in thought. Jace keeps his hand on your arm but uses his other hand to pat Luke’s back. Then Luke looks up at you with a strange determination on his face. “Are you on our side?” You drop his hands in shock. With a quick glance around you see that nobody is in the halls besides two guards who stand watch at the doors to the courtyard. You gather the skirts of your dress and bend slightly to come face to face with Luke.  “Little Luke Velaryon what are you talking about?” The words come out as a whisper unnoticed by the guards but Jace and Luke hear them loud and clear and they do not back down. “Our uncles call us bastards. The whispers of the court say that it is Aegon who should be our grandsire’s heir. Do you stand with us or with them?”  Luke is bolder than Jace. He always has been. Unlike Jacaerys who strives to be the perfect dignified gentle-lord Luke is proud like the Velaryons and does not hold his tongue.  “I am my mother’s daughter; Saera Targaryen would see no value in such disagreements. I do not wish to fuel a fire that is already roaring. The politics of Westeros are still strange to me but my position here is not. I have no right to say what should happen to the iron throne but I assure you that I love you and your mother very much. That is all I can say.” Luke nods his youthful face looking mature for the first time. He seems as if he will argue but he holds his tongue because of a lack of response. Jace takes your arm in his again and as you wait for Rhaenyra and Daemon to join the three of you Jace talks to you in whispers.  “Even you must feel the division of the court.” He shows no signs of discontent but Lucereys is still mulling over your response. “Trust that I feel the division like a knife in my back.” Your stare rises to meet his eyes. For a moment he is silent but his eyes are loud enough. The conversation ends there as Rhaenyra and Daemon approach to lead the family to their carriages. You watch the doors open but stop before crossing them; Jace pulls you through.  • • • • • • •,2024-07-12 02:48:04 GMT

The queue has rules including that men get to go before women. Not all the rules are fair or make sense but everyone following these rules is what keeps them from not killing each other over who gets to go first.  The queue master decides that Rhaenyra gets to skip a lot of people and go first just because he likes her.   And Rhaenyra is like “Well the queue master said I can and he’s in charge of the queue so…”  In the books Alicent goes “Hey you can’t do that! My son was in front of you in line.”  In the show Alicent goes “Uh actually the queue master said it was my son who should go first.”  Then the queue master dies leaving no one there to mediate the argument anymore so they proceed to murder each other and everyone else over who should actually be first in line.   Notice how none of these people will actually change the stupid queue rules if either of them win the argument.,2024-07-12 04:46:02 GMT

We bought a small house by paying down payment installments and we put everything we owned and the most expensive things we owned so that we could own the house but fate had a different opinion. Unfortunately I lost my house. It was targeted by the occupation with a missile from a warplane. We built it with hardship fatigue and loans and we did not finish repaying its wish. We are now homeless sleeping on the ground and covering the sky and without the slightest necessities for human life. My husband lost all of his goods and trade and he had nothing left. We were forced to briefly move by military force from our home to safe places and when the danger increased we were displaced several times. And many times I tried to escape with my life and the life of my child in my womb and the time for her birth had come and I could not find a bed in the hospital to give birth to my child. We did not find treatment and I did not find milk for my infant. I did not have the necessities of a normal life for her. Unfortunately we lost our homes our dreams our future and some of my family and friends. We lost our strength and our ability. I have to live so I decided to create a donation link so that I can live in light of the difficult circumstances and the very high cost of living that we live in and so that I can provide milk and Pampers for my little girl and so that I can build my house again. We are a simple family who love life but currently we are deprived of our most basic rights to live in safety and peace.We hope you will contribute to helping us start a new lifeThank you very much and may God reward you with all the best.,2024-07-12 04:22:08 GMT

She could’ve even left and came back. It’s like a 10 minute flight. She could’ve came back with Rhaenyra and they could’ve jumped Vhagar.

9,House of the Dragon,['hotd'],emynarnen,Should not have gone on twitter to get all the new HOTD stills.  Someone posted a leak that absolutely disgusted me. Not looking forward to the new episode at all.  (Frankly that’s how I have been feeling since 202. It just gets worse and worse every week. Every monday after watching this show I do not feel satisfied and exhilarated. I just feel angry and frustrated. I don’t know who in that writer room came up with this but I blame Condal and Hess.)  I’m this close to giving up on the show and only sticking out for the actors and dragons honestly. So if I post less and less HOTD stuff in the future you know why🤮,2024-07-12 05:08:01 GMT

That’s not how her story begins but it’s what you need to know…  Index - next  Azantys’s wings spread over the sky in King’s Landing swallowing the clouds around his imposing shadow turning day into night as his body covered in emerald green scales cut through the sky.   On the dragon’s back Princess Aella Targaryen stood her skilled hands gripping the reins of the saddle. She was used to the turbulence of flight but her heart sank knowing that a few meters behind her two smaller dragons were struggling to keep up with the elder’s pace.   “Stay steady!” she shouted. The roars of the three dragons drowned out every other sound. The sky was a safe place for them the Targaryens of Dragonstone.   She had flown for the first time alongside her father Baelon and her mother Alyssa. They had taught her everything she knew about dragons. Aella had taught Daemon and now she was guiding her own daughters Daera and Celaena on their first long journey on the backs of their dragons. The sun was already low when the three landed in a wake of dust outsideof one of the enormous vault tunnels ringing the dragonpit.   As soon as they stepped onto land the breeze swept their hair Aella’s eyes turned to the sky the chill running down her spine reminding her of dark days in King’s Landing. The summer was long but the memory of winter was always present for those who witnessed it. The dragonkeepers approached them commanding the three dragons in High Valyrian towards the tunnels. Azantys was already old and obedient he knew the protocols but Dreamstealer and Myckre were still stubborn and needed the encouragement of the spears to move.  “Please be kind to him” Celaena kindly asks one of the dragonkeepers before letting Dreamstealer go.  “Sister!” Daemon called as he approached smiling. He was disheveled with blood on his face and armor but he had a smile capable of brightening the darkest days. “How I missed you.”   The prince cradled his older sister’s face affectionately between his strong hands and rested his forehead against hers closing his eyes and feeling his body relax like it hadn’t done in a long time. Aella had been his home since his mother’s death.   “My beloved child” the princess whispers a smile taking over her lips. She kisses her brother’s forehead beside her he looked nothing like the soldier everyone feared the rebel prince he was just her gentle child. “What do these bloody robes means?”  “Clean robes do not keep the streets of the capital safe sister” the prince replies shrugging and then stepping away to look at his two nieces who were eager for some attention. “What are you waiting for to give your old uncle a hug?”  Daemon opens his arms and pulls Daera and Celaena to a hug the two giggle as they are suffocated by their uncle’s strong body. The longing they felt was not unfounded Daemon’s appointment as master of coin and many other positions that came after Viserys assumed the throne had taken the prince away from Dragonstone and not even quick visits to fraternize with his sister and nieces could replace the hole left by his absence.  “We flew from Dragonstone to here alone!” Daera says excitedly.  “Oh uncle you should have seen it! It’s all so beautiful from up there!” Celaena completes her sister’s speech her dreamy gaze turning to the already gray skies.  The satisfaction on Daemon’s features was explicit; nothing made him happier than seeing his two girls become full Targaryens. He himself had gifted them the dragon eggs when they were no more than three years old. The Dreamfyre’s eggs hatched in the same year 101 AC and were named Myckre and Dreamstealer.  “I’ll take you to fly over King’s Landing after the tournament just the three of us” the prince proposes proud of the two young ladies.  The sight of the happy and excited girls and the prince’s affection for them filled Aella’s heart.  Daemon and Aella exchange a few more words and then finally turn to the wheelhouse ready to take them to the Red Keep. The wheelhouse and retinue sets out down the Street of the Sisters the road connecting the eponymous hills of Rhaenys and Visenya. It’s spring in King’s Landing. All is in bloom. In the far distance stands the great Red Keep imposing and indestructible it’s shadow covering King’s Landing just as the wings of Balerion the Black Terror had done years before.  Arrival at the castle is not at all discreet everyone knows that the princess is there and they don’t make an effort to pretend to be natural. Aella’s presence in the capital was like an eclipse so rare that the youngest soldiers didn’t even know who she was. The princess could bet that the last time she was there those soldiers were nothing more than children eating their own snot and she would win.   “My princess” one of the guards said before bowing. Aella didn’t pay enough attention to remember his face she was focused on the conversation between Daemon and Daera who were debating about something related to High Valyrian.  She couldn’t blame the kids for being excited but she knew she wouldn’t be able to talk to Daemon in peace while her daughters were around.  “Daera won’t let me talk” Celaena complains pulling the sleeve of her mother’s dress her kind eyes were sad. She also wanted her uncle’s attention but she didn’t have much knowledge about valyrian books or fighting training with Dornish teachers to share.   “Daera doesn’t let anyone talk” corrects the princess with a gentle smile caressing her daughter’s cheek to comfort her. “You will have your chance my dear.”  The young lady nods and waits patiently. Dinner is served in Aella’s quarters and she allows her daughters to stay until a little after sunset talking and sharing their stories but even so when the time came to retire to their chambers the two young ladies begged to stay.   “Please mother I haven’t even told Uncle Daemon about our hunt in the Vale yet” pleads Daera.  “And what about me?! I haven’t been able to tell him anything because you haven’t shut up since we arrived!”   Celaena scolds her sister crossing her arms sullenly but no argument changes the princess’s will who smiles and guides the two girls to the door kissing each one on the forehead before letting them leave. No matter what they did those girls were the pride and joy of Aella’s life.  “They were excited today” brings up Daemon a satisfied smile on his lips.  “They’ve waited to see you for a long time.”  “You should allow them to fly alone they are no longer babies.”  “They’re twelve Daemon.”  “You and Azantys had already crossed the skies more than a thousand times by the time you were their age.”  Aella smiles as she remembers the old days when being young and reckless was fun and not scary.  “Anyway it’s just advice I’d like to see them more often and since you won’t come to me let them come.”  “I will take your advice into consideration” the princess responds and he nods giving her a smile so gentle that doesn’t seem right.  Comfortable silence falls over the two as they exchange glances but Daemon cuts it off as soon as he realizes.  “You did not allow the servants to warn Viserys about your arrival…”  The prince said stretching in his chair his finger gently circling the edge of his wine cup. Aella was standing up next to the door A few steps away a huge window rose making it easier for your eyes to get lost in the view of the night in King’s Landing.  She did not miss that place marked by pain suffering and betrayal for any second. Being there was an unbearable sequence of hearing the screams of the dragons in the pit the cries of her grandmother in the corridors the laments of the mothers who lost their children in the winter and the footsteps of the rats carrying swords and fraternizing with the dragons in the halls.  “Aella?” Daemon called again frowning at seeing his sister so distant.  “Sorry… I just- I hate this place” the princess said her voice trembling she pulls the robe she was wearing closer to her body trying to get some comfort but has no success.  “Everyone hates it. There isn’t a soul alive or dead who would be happy to live here” Daemon walks over to her and cup’s her cheeks. “But” the prince adds pulling her closer and kissing her forehead tenderly “I’m glad you’re here with me.”   “Me too Daemon… me too. The girls wanted to come so much and I… I confess that I came more to check if you are well settled here than to attend this ridiculous tournament that Viserys organized.”  “You’re worried if I’m settled sister?” he fails not to laugh and she can’t help but copy the gesture.  “I’m worried about lot’s of things especially things that involve you. But yes I’m worried if you’re happy and well settled here. This place… you must be lonely here.”  “You honor me with your concern Aella but I have Viserys and Rhaenyra she is a good girl she’s so much like you in some ways and keeps me company when I have no one else. And also…” he smiles and rests his forehead against hers. “I am a man sister I am used to it. Loneliness makes us stronger.”   “You were never alone on Dragonstone.”   “At what price? What glory can one achieve in the safety of one’s cradle?”   “The glory of a long and happy life Daemon. That is the only glory I wish for my children.”   The princess walks away and returns to the table to pour a cup of wine the air was cold the stone walls made the nights colder than they should be. Aella was used to the cold of Dragonstone but in King’s Landing everything seemed worse when added to the fetid odor of the city.   “You still haven’t answered my question sister. Why didn’t you allow Viserys to be warned of your arrival?”   “I wouldn’t want to deal with Viserys any more than necessary” she replies sitting down and signing for Daemon to sit down as well. “He’d start all that drama about our family’s lack of communication and…”  “And how we Targaryens have to unite above all else” Daemon adds laughing at his sister’s tone.  “And I’d have to be very rude to him.”  “Very rude to the king” he points out.  “The king of the seven kingdoms…” Aella sighs and drinks her wine in one go. “My foolish and kind little brother… I still can’t get over it.”  “If you had listened to your husband you could have been on the throne.”  “Daemon…” she scolds him. “Talking about it could be considered treason at the very least.”  “You know it’s the truth. You were the big sister you had the right to the throne.”  “Our cousin had the right to the throne an heir and the support of a house of Valyrian blood. Do you know what that influenced when it came to claiming her right to the throne? Nothing. The fact that she was a woman weighed more heavily. If I had stood up against Viserys the most I would have achieved would have been to start a war that’s considering someone would be willing to fight for me.”  “I would fight for you the entire Vale of Arryn would have if you had asked Harold to.”  The mention of the name of Harold Aella’s long-dead husband made her smile sadly.  “You’re right Harold would have placed the entire Vale at my disposal. But would you fight against your brother? Your own flesh and blood?”  The prince falls silent his gaze lowered and his anxious hands started to fidget. Aella knows the answer but chooses to ignore it.  “Our grandmother wanted Rhaenys on the throne. That was her last wish and I respected it by not putting myself forward as a candidate.”  “Yet Viserys reigns” Daemon reminded her. “It could be you Aella.”   “I could but I shouldn’t. Can you imagine me reigning in the conditions I was in that year Daemon? It hadn’t been twenty days since Viserys’ coronation when I lost my husband and son. Now imagine if I were the queen how would I manage to reign? The answer is only one: I wouldn’t. The resentment I hold against Viserys is strictly reserved for the fact that he accepted the nomination and stood against Rhaenys. For going against our grandmother’s last wish. Your daydreaming about putting me on the throne never crossed my mind not even for a moment or while.”   The princess’s answer doesn’t surprise him but it doesn’t please him either.   “You lack ambition sister.”   “I lack nothing Daemon. For the first time in years I feel like I’m close to having everything I’ve ever wanted: healthy children a safe home and faithful dragons that multiply more every day. No crown could make me happier.”  “And what do you need to be completely happy?”   Aella knew she had to be careful with what she said to Daemon he was the type of person who would go to extremes to please the one he loved and telling him she needed something was decreeing that he would give her.  “I need to see my little brother fulfilled and happy Daemon. That’s the only thing I’m missing.”  “I’m happy right now with you.”  “You won’t have me forever I want you to find something to make you really happy. Something that’s yours.”  “You are mine.”     A/N: please be kind English is not my first language.  Continue in:  Celaena I —,2024-07-12 06:30:55 GMT

A quick and heated meet-up happens in the godswoods gardens in Riverrun during the Harvest Feast.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; “Well? Do tell!”  You let out an exasperated sigh as your friend dragged you across the halls to the common room for the debrief amongst quartet.  “Bellena you’ve become tiresome tonight” you groaned. She stuck out her tongue.  It was a fortnight since the evening that was spent at Harroway amongst the girls. Neither of them had a moment to debrief on the specific evening until now at Stone Hedge. You’ve been thinking about the time you spent by the distant trees of the tavern and how you longed for the butterflies you felt in your stomach. More meetings with suitors set by your mother were spent in vain finding an excuse or another to explain to your parents that none of them would work and another sigh coming from them.  Greeting the guard outside the common room you both found the other two ladies chatting away by fire.  “There you are!”  “We’ve been waiting for you!”  “We must debrief!”  You sighed quietly as you sat wanting to ensure that the conversation didn’t fall on you to recount the memories of your evening with a certain Blackwood. You looked at Lyanne recollecting however an interesting view “Well? Get on with it. How was your kiss with the Northerner?” you wiggled your eyebrows and then more seriously “Did you also get ahold of that tea I mentioned?”  Lyanne’s stark contrast to her previous state was present blithe and gushing as she recollected her evening with the man from House Locke - a rather improvement from the previous man she had been.  Kaya the other from the friend group had a nice chat but nothing noteworthy. In actuality they’ve never known Kaya to be one to gush or express interest in any of the men presented to her. But she’s always been one to wish the other girls well with any suitors and was rather pleased if something went well. You liked Kaya she was the most relatable one to you even if she was rather distant at times.  Bellena on the other hand was most like Lyanne but less whimsical and wasn’t taken away by the words of men. Her spirit was rather charming. Much like a siren she knew how to turn an opportunity to her favor and her evening at that tavern was nothing short of what she had expected with her time with Ser Aron.  “You’re awfully quiet” one of them noticed.  “You did have us leave in haste” the other added.  “Did you have a good time?” the last asked.  You breathed in debating if you should explain your… dilemma? No it was nothing noteworthy. “Nothing eventful happened“ you sighed. &quot;And I agree with Kaya the man I spoke with was nothing of note as well. It was getting late and I didn’t want my aunt to fret” you shrugged. It wasn’t an absolute lie but it wasn’t the truth either. It was a middle ground you were satisfied with.  Bellena wasn’t sold on this half-truth glaring at you when the others weren’t looking. You rolled your eyes.   It was your experience to live in and you were willing to swallow your emotions for the sake of preventing anything further from happening. None of them would understand. What could they possibly say that you didn’t already know?   This was an issue and feud that spanned generations-long between the two houses and none of them would be willing to understand the intense dislike you carried for the Blackwoods and how utterly wrong that evening was; you weren’t going to be swayed by mere words from your friends.  You quietly sighed ordering more tea and snacks for the common room from the nearby maid.  -  The ladies bid themselves farewell in the morning after staying for the night watching them go from inside the bailey gates.  Come nightfall when supper was served you couldn’t help but feel a sort of tension in the air. Something was filled with a sort of anxiety nervousness. A loaded silence waiting to explode.   Your father cleared his throat gaining your attention.  “You must marry soon” is all he says rather uncomfortably.  Confusion falls upon you at his sudden and weird comment. You looked at him curiously not understanding. You were out meeting suitors but it wasn’t your fault the men were falling short.  Your mother grabs his hand trying for a more eloquent explanation to his sudden request “The Harvest Feast is upon us and House Tully has already sent out their invitations to have us join them. It would be a great opportunity for you to meet someone” she says. “We’ve been… rather… flexible with you –”  “And I’m forever grateful for the privilege mama but this is all so sudden. I don’t understand where this is coming from” you frowned.  She looks at her husband not meeting her gaze and tries again as she takes in a breath “Lord Greyjoy has taken an interest in you.”  “The old geezer?”  “The Red Kraken.”  “The Red Kraken? As if that makes things better! Does he not have a wife already? 4 others in fact.”  “My sweet” your mother reaches out for your hand “we urge you to marry. His reputation from what we hear… it’s not great. The ironborn… they’re a culture foreign to us and we want to ensure you’re happy with your future beloved. But time is running out and Lord Greyjoy has plans to declare for you…”  “No daughter of mine will become a salt wife” your father scorned to no one in particular. You held your breath.  “You” he said after some time a distressed look in his eyes “you are my one and only daughter. Love marriages are miracles but not impossible” blindly returning his wife’s caress on his hand. “However I will have to marry you off to someone soon should you fail to secure a marriage yourself.”  Needing a moment to digest with too many thoughts running nothing was said from your end other than a nod of understanding.  Keeping quiet throughout supper in the hallways leading up to your bedroom and throughout the bath that was readied for you the thought of having no control over whom you would soon wed terrified you.  You asked the maids to leave you in the warm water breath becoming shallow as you thought about the prospect of marrying Dalton Greyjoy and the thought of it boiling your blood. You would need to find your finest silks finest jewelry finest anything to find a man that would make-do. Thinking conservatively a love marriage wasn’t in the cards anymore as much as your parents would like but a decent marriage would at least grant you the freedom of a married woman. All you would need to do is give birth to an heir and the best possible outcome would be that your future husband would leave you alone or flourish pray to the Maiden.  You groaned.   You didn’t want something decent you wanted a love marriage. You wanted one like your parents and it was breaking your heart. Why Dalton Greyjoy of all people why was this happening so soon? And why the Blackwood?   You thought back to the evening promenading around the tavern the shared laughter the attentiveness and careful actions around you the scar above his lips the dark hair the kiss by the trees the grasp around your waist the stirring in your loin. A hand ventured your quiet sobs drowned out as you held yourself underwater hoping no one would hear you.  The Harvest Feast was a celebration that often involved the overlord and their noble houses. Lord Paramount Grover Tully although failing in age and growing weak was not one to miss on these feasts to celebrate with his vassals. He was a man committed to his principles as Lord Paramount of the Trident however weak or bedridden and this was one of them.  Your Lord father made his rounds greeting the other lords in the Riverlands when the Harvest Feast came around ensuring you got the opportunity to meet their eligible sons he thought were worth presenting. Swallowing embarrassment polite smiles were exchanged and sure enough after the feast was served and the dancing ensued their sons would come looking for you. None of them being the raven-haired male you were looking for.  “Are you enjoying yourself my dear?” your mother asked.   You gave her a look hoping she’d understand that No you were not enjoying yourself but you would at least keep trying as you sat down from a rather painful dance with one the many lord’s sons.   She only chuckled and continued her wine keeping a worried expression for herself as she looked away.  Your eyes secretly scanned for the Blackwood boy then focusing on your feast table when you’d catch yourself looking for him.   House Blackwood had feasted opposite of you. The seating arrangements were set up to prevent any unnecessary interactions between the opposing families but no one knew for certain if such efforts were futile seeing how many many feasts were set up similarly and one imbibed with too much ale or wine (or even ego or pride for that matter) would always end up in a yelling match with the other. It was tradition at this point in jest.  &quot;M&#x27;lady?” one of the men had offered his hand to you an invite to take up the upcoming ballad. As you did with the others you paid little mind to the small talk the young lord would make other than the small compliments and the “thank you&quot;s that ensued.  No enjoying yourself or the lack of conversation between you you thought about ending the dance abruptly excusing yourself with whatever excuse you could think of to go back to people watching.  &quot;I’m quite parched” you fanned yourself in the middle of the dance which wasn’t a total lie. Catching on he excused himself fetching you something to drink and leaving you in the middle of the floor with others swirling to the ballads. The perfect opportunity.  You used the moment to get away from the crowd get away from the Great Hall and get away from the bustling noises. You enjoyed such festivities but you couldn’t help but seek time for yourself in the middle of it all. When it all became too much it would become emotionally consuming having to show up for everyone and everything.  Finding the nearest balcony and a seat you took in the evening wind breathing in the musky and leafy scent of Riverrun in its autumn glory. You couldn’t help but notice the detailings of the castle on the way to the balcony the trout fish carved into the pillars the clear sigil of House Tully. An appropriate sigil for the castle seeing how it was built on land that separates two rivers–both streams flowing on both sides of the big castle.  Lost in thoughts and observances you almost didn’t see the figure out of the corner of your eye as it passed by the godswood garden below the balcony.  The raven-haired man. A sort of a pressure and a sigh of relief left you finally finding the person you’ve been hoping to see all evening. Your curiosity peaked and a form of excitement brewed in you while studying him. Walking up to the godswood trees he planted himself there his back facing you. You saw the way his head bowed. Saw the way his jaw looked to be moving as if praying. The moment seemed peaceful curious about what he was saying.  Taking a seat in front of the weirwood tree he sat there as if finding solace. The Blackwoods were the only ones in the Riverlands who still only worshiped the old gods - something you weren’t still sure if you admired from afar for being deeply rooted in their culture or stubborn for not converting to the Holy Faith.  You debated reaching out grabbing his attention.  But then what?  You shook your head knowing it would only end in a terrible shouting match and you’d be named the Harvest Feast Bracken this year. You had very little patience for nonsense with Blackwoods and you were sure he would get on your nerves one way or another.  You decided to leave him be and just admire his solace from afar for some time.  Back inside you sat back next to your mother after your little time away wine cup still on hand as she looked at you. “Well? How are things going?”  You groaned “Mother please must you always insist on how everything is?”  “Well I think Lord Darry is a fine fellow. Rather handsome I think” recalling after the last man you danced with.  “Mama.”  “My Sun I am trying my best to ensure your future…is with someone you want to be with. But you’re making this difficult” she no longer was sympathetic but a sad yet stern presence became apparent in her voice as she looked at you. “An arranged marriage can be done yes but I… I want you to be happy with whom you’ll be spending your time with.”  You mused at this as you paused on her words. It was a real priviledge for you to have this sort of freedom within the realm. Not many married for love and more so for duty. You often times found it easier to give up and find a husband for duty. But this was a gift and althought frightening you wanted to explore its options.   You hugged your mother for the comfort and for wishing you the best in this scary part of every woman’s lives; you debated if you should bring up a touchy subject. You hesitated wondering how you’d phrase the scenario in a way that wouldn’t give suspicion. It was rather difficult.  “As long as they’re not a Blackwood” you muttered coolly studying your nails. Nice.  “Good gods anyone but that treacherous family” your mother laughed a red glow in her face appearing from drinking wine.  Disappointment hides in your face as you feign a laugh. Not the response you were looking for. “Good. Wouldn’t be caught dead with a Blackwood.”  A figure from your peripheral view catches your attention seeming to have been walking up to you.  Except when you turned you saw the raven-haired man storm away and your laughter fades with every step he takes a quiet panic taking over.  “Oh posh leave him” your mother pouts in scowl. “He had no business here anyway.”  You start to think that she hasn’t assumed anything which you thank the gods for but your heart sinks for Davos. Eyeing him as he exits you try to come up with an excuse to get away from your mother without her worrying. “Umm have you seen father? I think he was asking for you before I came. I need to find Lord Darry for my drink should I get ale or wine?” After taking a bit long to respond you depart by telling her wine should be the better refreshment and Lord Darry should bring you another one all while eyeing the exit.  Inside you start to panic after not being able to find the raven-haired lord turning around every corner in the castle hoping to see him and only finding empty rooms and in one embarrassing instance a young couple needing their privacy followed by profuse apologies from your end. After spending a lot of time searching you thought about how it was getting to be too late to apologize and you’d never recover from this moment.  Finally outside you saw a caped figure by the godswoods garden - of-fucking-course - and a lump in your throat starts to form as you approach him.  He turns to you and emptily chuckles to himself. “Well if it isn’t the pride of Stone Hedge” he announces to no one.  You frown clearly starting off on the wrong foot but taking a moment to form your words before you begin.  “Davos I… I wanted to apologize” you try in effort to veer back into diplomatic territory.  But he shakes his head and something of disappointment appears in his dead eyes “Tell me Bracken do you practice being insufferable or does it come naturally?”  “Davos I am trying to apologize.” You let out.  “For what?” he shrugs maintaining the same dead eyes.  “For… for…” you try and think about how stupid everything was going to sound. For saying the truth out loud? For hurting his feelings? For lying to your mom? Why was she apologizing to a Blackwood in the first place?  He nodded with a frown clearly disappointed. You groaned in exasperation growing frustrated with everything “Ugh! I-I don’t know I don’t know Davos! I wanted to come and apologize! I don’t even know why I’m apologizing in the first place!”  Unamused he shrugs again “Can’t accept an apology if you don’t know what you’re sorry for.”  “Oh fuck you!”  “Fuck me?” He points to himself disbelief in his voice. “Fuck you! And your mother!”  Your hand meets his face and leaves him with a red print both shock and adrenaline running through you as you point him a finger. “You leave my mother out of this” you spit.  He stuns for a moment astonished by the force of a woman before him then recollects himself. He finds your finger pointing at him when he looks grabbing your wrist to remove it from view with a grunt.  “Get your hands off me!” You try to retreat your hand from his grasp but he locks in grabbing your other wrist as you try to fist the free hand and muster all the strength you have to hit him and release you. “Let me go!”  Heaving as you try to shake your wrists off him you don’t hear him call your name until he embraces you leaving you in a confused state.   “I… I stepped out of line” is all he says after things seemed to calm.  You pushed yourself off of him and met him with another slap.  Grabbing his jaw all he does is nod. “Deserved.”  “Fuck you!”  Another nod “I mean…”  “You’re so… so…!” you try to come up with the meanest most profane vile insult you can muster but your thoughts run with the wind not finding the correct words to fully explain him and his being well.  “I’ll wait” he shrugs as he crosses his arms.  “Davos! Shut up!”  He bites back a smile as he looks down.  You groan pacing back and forth “Look I’m-I’m sorry for… what you heard back there. I saw you walk up to me when I said that. And it was such a… a moment I-I-I just kinda panicked and… No I’m not going to be elaborating anything further but I just wanted you to know and I know we’re in a relatively public space right now and we can be seen but I don’t care about that because it’s not even about what you think it was about!”  He says nothing as he studies you arm still crossed and you grow uncomfortable under his silence wondering about what he’s thinking.  With a defeated sigh you hang your head “Davos say something yeah?”  But before he could answer your father calls for you from a distance announcing your early departure.  “I… must leave” you look towards the distance “but…” you look at him hoping he says something hoping to ask you to meet him somewhere anything.  You leave him in the godswoods garden in Riverrun.  And for that Davos will always kick himself for not telling you everything. How you stutter when you have a million things running through your mind. How you became the most magnificent woman when enraged and how good you smelled when he embraced you. He too had a million thoughts but none of them expressing himself in the way he wanted to scared to push you away or the time not lending itself for him to say everything. Much less when you had to leave so sudden.  He looked at the weirwood tree they were both under before you departed and had hoped the gods would work on his favor and see you soon.  _____________________________________________________________  ~ Tag list: @cypherpt5fttaehyung,2024-07-12 06:27:33 GMT

He won’t stay in the dragon pit won’t eat any food given to him and no one ever sees him” Rhaenyra began   “Hmmm&quot; I begin to ponder a suitable answer or then just I don’t want to.  “I do not like the way the dragon master would train the dragons so I decided a different way”   “Yet it’s not only been that instance of difference between you and the rest of us. Everything about you is different. Your hair is more black than white and the rumors of your dragon breathing lightning instead of fire. What sets you apart from the rest of us?” Rhaenyra finally asked   “Hmm I’ve never thought about it” I lied   Of course I’ve thought about it. Why was the storm on my birth connected to my birth? How was I able to bring Rhaeraxes back from his cold egg and why is he growing so quickly? Why is my hair darker?  I have more questions than answers. However my family seems to have their own opinions.  My father says the storm was due to my “Velayron blood” being able to enrage the seas with my life My mother says my hair comes from her Baratheon family members  And my siblings say it was the Faith of the Seven    Allowing myself to forget I was with someone Rhaenyra pulled me back into the land of the living.    &quot;Are you okay?”  “Yes I’m sorry cousin if you’ll excuse me I have to get ready to leave King’s Landing” I responded back to Rhaenyra        (Daemon’s P.O.V)  Humiliation   That’s what this is.  I am humiliated.   I have been denounced as my brother’s heir and been replaced by Rhaenyra.  My brother doesn’t understand how to be a King and now he doesn’t understand how he doomed the realm.   I need more power and more men   Caserys I could use him his father’s men and his family’s dragons but I would never be able to gather his father’s support.  I need to wait biding my time until I am ready to strike  That’s the key to win      (Caserys’ P.O.V)  Driftmark seems so cold now. I have been away for quite some time. My room is very clean but hasn’t been lived in. The rock near my room where Rhaeraxes would perch has old burn marks yet no new ones.  King’s Landing has been comfortable but too crowded for Rhaeraxes meaning I hadn’t seen him. He had been staying away from the dragon pit and the people in King’s Landing in general. That meant he stayed away from me for most parts of the day.  I could only recognize his roar from a distance or notice his shadow in the sky when I was alone.   Now I can se—  “Cassy!” I feel hands grab my shoulders turning me forward  As I turn at my new nickname to see my sister Laena. She’s smiling perhaps happy to see me or my reaction to her new name for me.  “Why Cassy? It doesn’t sound like a man’s name at all” I ask   “Hmm I suppose it does not however I believe that’s why it suits you even more” she responds   “Oh? What is that supposed to mean?” I question her again   “Nothing important Father wants to speak to you.” She replied   Cutting my conversation with Laena I begin to look for my father to find him in the Maesters room.      Third Person View  Caserys walked into the room to find his father sitting down looking towards the ocean with the Maester whispering into his ear.  Once he had noticed Caserys he had called him to move forward.  “Hello my son” Corlys started   “Hello father” Caserys replied   “My son tell me what you know of Daemon Targaryen”  “Why father?”  “He has notified me that he will aid our battle for the stepstones to reclaim our land” Corlys smiled back somewhat twistedly   “I’m sure you can guess he wants the crown he believes was taken from him. I suppose if helping you would rally your support in his cause I imagine he would.”   “I gathered that but what of his interest in you. The crown wouldn’t justify his sudden interest in your life”  “I haven’t the slightest clue perhaps you should speak to him yourself”  “Watch your tone Caserys I merely mean what of his plans require your help?”   “Forgive me Father for I do not know”  “Very well understand that with our battle of the stepstones your help on dragon back will be most crucial. Laena hasn’t bonded to a dragon and Rhaeraxes outweighs Seasmoke”  “I understand I will be ready”  “Go”     (Caserys’ P.O.V)  After exiting my father’s chambers I make my way outside the castle to find my dragon. To finally be able to see my dragon in the flesh.    Rhaeraxes’ large body exits the sea caves from underneath the castle finding a new hiding spot from his rock.  As he approaches me I notice the large horns on each side of his face resembling Meleys. Rhaeraxes’ three black horns on both sides dawing six horns.   He leans down his face right next to my body. As I place my hands I feel the texture of his rough scales underneath my skin.  “We’re going to have to fight soon We just can not lose control again…”  Rhaeraxes curls his head close to me finding comfort in my presence.   Yet feeling a different presence Rhaeraxes finishes his huddle into my body and then travels back into the sea caves just as Caraxes flies over Driftmark Castle.  “Daemon’s war for the crown is going to kill us…”     A/N Back from dead… Feeling pretty good. I’m trying to speed these chapters along for season 2. This chapter is loosely based on Episode 2 but the next chapter will be more coherent and better attached to the timeline. For reference Rhaeraxes is around Drogon’s size perhaps a little smaller so maybe more around Rhaegal. I also changed the spelling of Rayraxs’ name to Rhaeraxes (again pronounced Ray-rax-sis).

The overall topic of the post is all about dragons dragonriders and draconic sigils. But amidst that he put in a little mention of seahorses.   Then he goes into a couple of paragraphs about how the shows got the sigils wrong. Although he is talking about dragons because it’s the main topic of the post it could still apply to seahorses too. Both Targaryen and Velaryon had their sigil altered in the show canon.  Seahorses exist in Westeros too and they have no legs to count.,2024-07-12 07:09:50 GMT

Giulia Targaryen was the second child of Crown Prince Aemon Targaryen and his wife Jocelyn Baratheon.   The infant was tiny at birth. Her cries were hardly audible. The maester and the midwife were concerned that the Stranger may be at the young princess’s door when they saw the small child but as the days went by the little princess began to show signs of recovery which relieved people around her especially her parents.   The announcement of the sex of the baby created a wave of disappointment throughout the realm. They were expecting this child to be a boy an heir for the heir. The royal couple was delighted with the birth of their second daughter as if she were a boy including her paternal grandmother Queen Alysanne.   Princess Rhaenys then eight years old loved her little sister. For a long time she had begged and prayed for a sibling and her wishes and prayers were answered. Even though the two princesses were born a decade apart and with different personalities they were attached to the hip. If they were both in the Palace at the same time they would always be spotted together arms linked and giggling.   Princess Giulia also enjoyed a close bond with Corlys Velaryon her sister’s husband. The Seasnake used to lavish his little sister with expensive gifts. He bestowed upon her the moniker “Golden Princess” because of the little child’s fascination with all thing’s gold.   The Princess had the basic education as her sister and other noble ladies. She was thought how to manage household duties Valyrian history art and embroidery and when she brought to the Queen’s household it expanded even more. A dragon egg was laid on her crib just like many previous Targaryen children before her but it never hatched. She would ride Silverwing her grandmother’s dragon eighteen years later and three years before she became Queen.,2024-07-12 07:02:30 GMT

apocalypse aegon reader and aegon have a complicated relationship but love each other i recommend the song ghost towns by radical face. this is kinda set in the walking dead show but no one in the show is mentioned.   summary: you’d do anything for aegon even give your life to save him.  warning (s): zombies guns knifes gore death fluff angst idk what else?   masterlist        you looked outside the heavy rain hit the windows of the truck. aegon was driving a faint hum of the the song love will tear us apart by joy division played in the cd player of the truck.   its been five months since a outbreak took place people got bit and ended up crazy. now the world was left in shambles towns and city’s tore down in a matter of minutes.   you and aegon dated before the outbreak despite the differences you both had you both loved each other. when the outbreak took place you were at his house and his mother called it felt like it was almost yesterday when it took place.   his mother called saying that his father and grandfather were in the hospital she was going to say something else but the phone disconnected that was last time aegon spoke to his mother. a few days later his siblings aemond helaena and daeron left without saying a word.   aegon and you eventually left his house trying to find aegon’s half sister rhaenyra but the house was covered in stains of blood you both left the house quickly.   you weren’t that close to your family but you tried to look for them. you went to your old house but ended up finding the house ransacked and empty. now it was the two of you alone in a cursed world.  aegon and you eventually learned that it was the bite that did it or even a scratch. don’t get bit!  “what are you thinking about love?” aegon suddenly spoke out his hands gripping onto the steering wheel.   the two of you had a complicated relationship you both would disagree on something which led into an argument aegon was short tempered that was for sure but he loved you and you loved him.  “hm? oh nothing. how much do we have on gas?” you said looking away from the window to him.  “about half a tank we’re good. i filled up another gas can in the back while you slept earlier.” aegon looked away from the road to you his eyes were bloodshot and he had eyebags under his eyes.   “you look tired..let me drive?” you looked at him your eyes almost pleading.   aegon looked back at the road a yawn escaping him. “i could use some sleep.” he nodded before pulling over to the side of the road.       .·:*¨¨* ≈☆≈ *¨¨*:·.     now it was night the rain had stopped creating a nice scent of smell in the air. the both of you laid in the bed of the truck piles of blankets and pillows under you and him and a blanket over your bare bodies. despite the outbreak the both of you always found a way to be intimate and enjoyed it.   you laid your head on aegon’s bare chest he had his arm around your waist playing with the strands of your hair as he looked at the stars above.   the silence between you both was comforting it was like the zombie apocalypse never actually happened.  “i wonder how aemond helaena and daeron are.” he suddenly spoke out. the two of you hadn’t spoke about family in four months it was a silent rule the two of you made.   “i’m sure they are fine maybe they are with your mother?” you spoke but the mention of his mother made his own body tense up despite all the things she had said to him he still craved her attention even if she wasn’t even here.   “i’m sorry-i shoul-” you immediately apologized and sat up the coldness picking at your skin.  aegon sighed running a hand though his face. he sat up the blankets pooling to his waist. “its fine.” he said but you knew it was a lie and you absolutely hated when he lied.  “you know i do not like it when you lie.” you looked at him growing irritated with him.   “i said i’m fine. now leave it.” aegon sighed laying back down.  “i know you aegon your not fine.” you said looking away from him. “but i don’t want to argue with you not tonight. so i’ll just leave it like that.”you laid your head back on his chest.   “i love you.” he muttered pulling you closer to him. “i love you so fucking much.”  you kissed his chest “i love you too.”        .·:*¨¨* ≈☆≈ *¨¨*:·.     it had been a few weeks since then and you and him found an old hunting cabin.   now you were looking through all the canned foods you had the two have been living off of canned soups and fruits for the past few weeks.   “damn it.” you mumbled to yourself there was a few canned soups but it wouldn’t last the next few days. you let out a sigh before closing the cabinet.  “how are we on food?” a voice spoke out behind you you looked over your shoulder and saw aegon leaning against the wall.  “we’re running low. we probably won’t have enough for the end of the week.” you said standing up and dusting your hands on your dirty jeans.  aegon let out a sigh walking over to you. “i saw a supermarket not to far from here. it looked pretty empty.”  “okay.” you nodded “we could go in the morning when it’s more brighter.” you put your hands on his shoulders.   “yeah.” aegon nodded. “more safer in the morning anyways.” he put his hands on your waist. “we should get some rest.”       .·:*¨¨* ≈☆≈ *¨¨*:·.     the next morning the two of you sat in the truck infront of the supermarket not yet going inside yet.   aegons eyes scanned over the building. like he said it looked pretty empty. “okay we need to be quick.”  “yep.” you nodded before you opened the passenger door your knife was in your back pocket and you had your gun in hand.  the two of them walked began to walk through the supermarket parking lot both of you were on high alert looking around for anything.  before the two of you entered the supermarket aegon stopped to look at you. “yell for me if anything goes wrong okay?” he pushed a strand of your hair behind your ear before the two of you walked into the supermarket.  the sunlight shined through the windows all the front shelves were empty and knocked over there was some blood spattered on the walls and floors but no bodies.  “i’ll go search in the back.” you spoke to aegon.  “okay..be careful.” he spoke as he watched you leave him.   you walked down the isle it was eerily silent the only noise being your footsteps stepping on glass. the feeling of uneasiness settled in your stomach as you looked around knowing that anything or anyone could be hiding behind the next corner.  but you breathed a sigh of relief as you saw some canned foods. you picked up a few cans of food and shoved them into your backpack. as you finished you heard a loud crash coming from infront of the store. your mind immediately drifted off to aegon.   your legs started to run as you slung your backpack over your shoulders. once you reached the front of the store you saw aegon fighting off three zombies their mouths snapping at him.   “aegon!” you yelled putting your gun away and pulling out your knife.   aegon snapped his head towards you “leave!” he yelled but you couldn’t just leave him you loved him too much.  “no!” you yelled stabbing a zombie in the head his body falling limp on the floor.   you saw a zombie about to bite aegon in the arm but you stepped infront of him the zombie biting on your arm instead as aegon too busy to notice stabbing the other zombie in the head as you stabbed the zombie on your arm in the head aegon grabbed your arm and you both left the supermarket.        .·:*¨¨* ≈☆≈ *¨¨*:·.     the drive back to the cabin was silent aegon didn’t even notice your arm bleeding from the bite and you were to busy thinking of what you were going to do what you’d eventually turn in the next 24 hours.   the two of you walked into the cabin aegon put yours and his backpack on the table both filled with food.  “are you okay? you’ve been quiet since the supermarket..” aegon spoke looking away from the food and towards you.  “i-“ you stuttered but ended up just showing him the bite mark. “i was trying to help you..but got bite in the middle of it.”  aegon’s eyes widened as he saw the bite mark. “no no..” his eyes started to fill with tears as he stumbled to you. he looked down at the bite mark again hoping this was just a bad dream and he’d eventually wake up but his sadness turned to anger. “i told you to leave me!”  “how could be so careless?!” he yelled. “you were supposed to get out of there! not to get yourself bitten!”  “i couldn’t leave you!” you yelled back you didn’t even realize tears were streaming down your face.   “well you should’ve!” aegon yelled tears falling down his face as well. “no i should’ve gotten bitten not you!”  “no.” you shook your head “i wouldn’t let that happen.”   aegon stepped away his voice breaking “what do we do now?!”  “i cannot turn into one of them aegon.” you shake your head. “i cannot.” you pulled out your handgun holding it out for him.  “no.” he shook his head “i won’t-i can’t do it. no.”  you stepped closer to him “i cannot become one of those things.”   he slowly grabbed the gun from your hands “i can’t-i love you.” his voice was raspy and cracking tears still streaming down both of your faces.  “i love you too.” you pressed your forehead to his closing your eyes. “i can’t become one of those things..”  aegon closed his eyes and with his free hand brought his hand to your cheek. “i love you so fucking much.” he leaned in and kissed you mixing both of their salty tears.  aegon pulled back and slowly pulled the handgun to your head breathing heavily. “i can’t do it..” he muttered but he had too.   “i love you..” aegon spoke before pulling the trigger the sound of the bullet filled his ears and left a ringing sound.   the both of you fell to the floor aegon put the gun on the floor bringing your lifeless body and cradling it burying his face into your neck sobs taking over his body “i’m so sorry.” he kept muttering rocking back and forth.,2024-07-12 08:13:50 GMT

1,House of the Dragon,['give these people a beach episode idc idc'  'hotd'],bigleoenergy,My biggest complaint about House of the Dragon since I started it is wishing we could see more of the character dynamics play out. Idk if it’s pressure to fit everything into ten 1 hr episodes(which they don’t need to limit themselves to in the first place) but I just want to see more of these relationships and characters because they’re all so interesting. Ex: Harwin and Rhaenyra barely interact for 3 minutes of total screen time despite having 3 children+ I feel like the writers have to force themselves to make Helaena have a moment with either of her brothers as if she and Aegon didn’t loose a son together and Aemond wasn’t the indirect cause of that sons death.,2024-07-12 09:54:10 GMT

Will the two finally have their first date or will something get in the way once more?  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Ewan’s publicist Donna has never had any issue with her client before. Always present and accounted for on time for whatever interview photoshoot or audition he has booked for the day.   But she hasn’t been able to get a hold of him in the past two days which is worrying her to no end because he is set to meet with a major casting director in New York some time in the coming week.  Donna may have a clue as to why. It’s only been two days as well since the pub incident when The Sun ran a story speculating on Ewan’s lovelife - the exact kind of thing he’s always been trying to avoid.   It had taken a life of its own with fans taking it upon themselves to track down every clue of the girl on the internet. Her instagram. Her relation to the cast - apparently she is a cousin of Luke and Elliott. Even the marketing agency where she works. Louise a 26-year old graphic designer admittedly harbours a crush on Ewan and when she heard that her cousins were hanging out with him at a pub nearby she almost immediately invited herself and her friends over.   But that’s all according to Ewan. After talking to Luke memories of the night came rushing back to him.   Stumbling out in the alley to send you that voice message. Rejoining the boys to see that they’ve got new company. Being introduced to Louise with Tom joking that he should be careful with the missus. Wouldn’t want her - you - to think that he’s flirting with anyone else.   Even though that’s exactly what happened. Not the flirting per se. Not from Ewan’s side at least. Louise had been brazen with admiration barely leaving his side the rest of the night. Asking him a bunch of probing questions he had neither the interest nor the patience to answer.   They had all thought the pub was safe from prying eyes. No one approached them for anything not even a single look of recognition followed by the question “Are you that guy from House of the Dragon?” Unfortunately it only takes one rat for a headline to surface. Ewan Mitchell’s mystery girl has been the talk of the fandom and Donna has been trying hard to quell the rumours.   Such is the nasty nature of the business as she knows Ewan has quickly learned.   She dials him again and to her surprise the call actually patches through.  Her client’s throaty voice is heard on the other line “Hey Donna sorry if I’ve missed your calls.”  “It’s alright it’s alright Ewan” Donna stammers. “Just glad to hear from you. Where are you? I’ve managed to do some damage control about those rumours and - ”  “Oh I’m in LA. I just landed about an hour ago” Ewan responds casually not mirroring the stress in Donna’s tone. Has he gotten over the fuss so easily?  “LA? You know your meeting is not till next week right? And it’s in New York. It’s very very important that you don’t miss it Ewan.”  “And I won’t” Ewan affirms laughing dryly to console his worried publicist. “I just need to see about something over here.”   Someone he thinks. He’s got his priorities straight.  “Work-related?” Donna asks curious.  “Uhhhm” Ewan dithers but decides against telling her about you. Not just yet. “Just visiting a friend. I’ll stay here for a while then fly out to New York don’t worry.”  “Okay just keep in touch alright? I’ll send more details about the meeting soon.”  “Sure thing. Thank you Donna.”   “Talk soon Ewan. Take care of yourself.”  Donna feels a huge sense of relief wash over her when the call ends knowing the whereabouts of one of her biggest clients. But why LA? Perhaps Ewan just needed some time off after the flurry of annoying headlines put out in the UK.  Or maybe he’s visiting with a friend? Who is stateside right now? Fabien’s filming in Philly. The rest of the boys are still in England. But then…  Her thoughts land on the one thing - the one person - that would make him fly out on such short notice. Without giving thought to anything else especially after the speculation on his romantic life.  Ewan’s never been one to share about personal affairs not even to his close-knit team but no matter how reclusive he is no one can deny the way he looks at you. The way he lights up when you’re brought up in conversation. The number of times he had excused himself from their meetings to make a call standing in the corner with a permanent smile etched on his face.   Oh Donna knows now just who he is in LA for.   ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎  Like inevitable spectres haunting someone of his profession Ewan noticed the papparazzi snapping away as he arrived in LA.   He told no one he would be coming so it must be an automatic thing in the city. The photogs are always scurrying in the periphery ready to catch anyone of note no matter the degree of fame or notoriety.  If you were keeping up with such news you would know he is in the city.   But according to your assistant Clara who was kind enough to inform him of your schedule you are still finishing up on another day of rehearsals for your upcoming rom-com. Ewan checked in the same hotel as you planning to seek you out as soon as you arrive back from work.  He hasn’t spoken to you since the voicemail and since those false news broke out. Not that he can blame you - wouldn’t anyone be suspicious of a drunken confession made by a guy who was allegedly in the company of another girl?  He hates it being subject to all of this. This nonsense that is keeping you from him not even worth any consequence.  But he will deal with the blows. As long as he sets things right with you. As long he gets you in the end.   He settles in his suite getting ready to meet with you once more. He showers shaves tousles his hair. He even checks whether he smells decent after all of that - once twice and another time. Being nervous to stand in front of a crowd is one thing; it’s a whole other conundrum for him finally see you again.   Maybe the crowds are more manageable and it baffles him to realise so. He can put on a persona be the actor and disappear inside himself as the cameras flash bright enough for him to disassociate.  But not with you. He wants to show you everything that he is who he truly is and it scares him. There is no team to help him get ready now. It’s all him just Ewan.   Clad in his trusty black jeans and a comfortable hoodie of the same dark colour he looks in the mirror one last time after receiving a text from Clara that you’ve arrived at the hotel about half an hour ago.  He contemplates opening the bottle of bourbon from the minibar and taking a shot of liquid courage - something to help him get his explanation ready. Just so he wouldn’t stammer in front of you.   Just so you he can make you see without any error or trace of doubt that he meant every word in that voicemail no matter how embarrassing it might have sounded.  He decides against it imagining the wrinkling of your nose as you catch a whiff of the alcohol. It’s cute when you do it and he adores it so dearly but he knows that it isn’t the right moment.  He rights himself rolls his shoulders and he’s out the door.   ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎  Jacob trails you inside your hotel suite laughing at some shared remark about the scenes you rehearsed for the day.  They were emotionally demanding and even after tossing around ideas for hours the two of you were unable to achieve a satisfying approach to the scenes.  Which is why he had proposed practicing well into the evening and you found yourselves heading back to your suite together. He has his own house in LA but your hotel just happened to be closer to the rehearsal studio.   “Care for a drink?” you asked him.  “Why the hell not?” he immediately assents in that easy Aussie drawl. “We might need it for this shite.”  You laugh in agreement “Indeed. I’ve got some canned gin and tonics if that’s alright.. or beer… or whiskey… ” you trail off as you study the contents of your fridge.  “G and t please mate” he settles down on the couch legs stretching in front of him. “We were so unproductive today. I just could not get that line right.”  “Tell me about it.” You hand him his drink and he clinks it with yours with a mumbled cheers. “It was me who can’t land the right tone” you say. “I mean is my character supposed to be confused in that moment? Or angry? Or sad?”  “Or all of ‘em.” he shrugs. “Tricky isn’t it?”  You hurriedly fetch your script from a table getting right down to it. “So for the first scene in the third act…”   Moments later with cans of gin and tonic discarded on the coffee table you and Jacob sit with legs crossed on the couch facing each other. Scripts in hand you go through the lines over and over with only seemingly minor tweaks each time. To an actor though even just the slightest change of pitch or expression makes all the difference.  “Is that better? I think we almost got it” you say after a read-through.   “Yeah so much better” he grins holding his hand up for a high-five. Just as your hands smack in the air another sound echoes faintly from the door.   “Someone’s knocking?” Jacob asks. “You expecting anybody? Room service or anything?”  “No” you shake your head trying to think of whether your assistant or publicist said anything about dropping by. “Maybe it’s just housekeeping?”  “I’ll get it” Jacob states already padding his way to the door.  A beat later you hear Jacob loudly exclaim “Ewan mate! It’s good to see you!”  Ewan? A shiver runs up your spine. Craning your neck to get a view of a doorway you catch sight of him half-obscured by Jacob’s tall frame.   Confused surprised and feeling some other emotion you can’t pinpoint you head over to greet him.   “How are you doing?” Jacob greets shaking Ewan’s hand oblivious to the poorly hidden distaste in his eyes.   “Wh-what are you doing here?” Ewan finds himself asking Jacob a bit rudely just as you ask him the same.   “What are you doing here?” you mirror his question at the exact same time.  “Oh!” Jacob breathes out a laugh “Well I’ll go first. We were just practicing lines.”  “In her room? Isn’t it a bit late for rehearsal? I thought you’re supposed to be off work.” Ewan asks and it sounds like an accusation. He starts to feel all kinds of uneasy - were the twins right about life imitating art?   You narrow your eyes at him. “We decided to continue running lines after rehearsal. There’s a scene we can’t get right. It’s quite tricky - ”  “Just the two of you? Alone here?” Ewan tilts his head gesturing towards the room like it’s some forbidden place.  Jacob shakes his head smile steady on his lips. If he’s caught on to how Ewan must be feeling he doesn’t let it affect him. He gives you a look as if to check your reaction and you give him a reassuring shrug.  Ewan does not overlook this exchange. He clenches his jaw irate from the assumptions popping up in his mind. Before he forgets his manners he says “Excuse me I just… wasn’t expecting… I just wanted to speak to you.”  “I didn’t even know you were in LA” you say before moving aside to usher him in. “But I’m glad you are of course. Come join us - ”  He nods making his way to the seating area where he spies the discarded cans of alcohol and dog-eared scripts. Maybe he should have taken that bloody shot after all.   He laughs joylessly to himself shaking his head. “Sorry you guys. I just flew in today and I must have been exhausted from the flight.”  “Hey no worries mate” Jacob says. “You know what I’ll be on my way. Give you time to catch up and all.” He picks up his own tattered script then gives you a kiss on the cheek bidding you with a “I’ll see you tomorrow. Have a good night sweetheart.”   If looks could kill and if his dear mother hadn’t raised him right he would have incinerated Jacob in that moment.   He is snapped out of his thoughts when Jacob claps him on the shoulder “Great to see you again mate. Have a good night eh?”  Ewan knows he’s being ridiculous. There’s nothing wrong with two friends and co-stars spending some time alone to rehearse. Besides last he heard you were adamant that you and Jacob are just friends.   So why is he being so irrational? Why does the idea of you spending more time than necessary with Jacob possibly falling for him bother him so much?   Ewan realises that this is what jealousy must feel like.   He’s had career envy before. Another actor landing a role he vied for. Someone else getting the praise he deserves.   But nothing like this. It’s petty and possessive.   He wants you to just be his.   You stand in front of him once more after you walk Jacob out of the suite.   “Hey” you say smiling weakly.   “Hi darling.”  Both of you want to do more. Say more. Usually you would greet each other with a hug and a kiss on a cheek his hands lingering on your forearms even after you pull away but the air is thick with tension.  You look at him with those bright expecting eyes of yours and Ewan just wants to cave in and make a sloppy confession. But not after that voicemail no. He’s determined to do this right. Words not slurred head clear.   “So I got your voicemail” you finally say smiling coyly. “That was… something.”  “Hmm” he can’t help but mirror your smile as always. “It was wasn’t it?”  “I understand” you continue taking a step closer “if you were drunk. We all say things when we’re off it that we maybe don’t mean - ”  “But darling I meant every word” he says way too quickly.   You laugh the sound of it erasing whatever apprehension remained in him. “Do you even remember what you said?”  “I do” he counters moving even closer to you. Another step and he’d be able to wrap his arms around your waist and pull you to him. “At least some of - no - most of it.”  “Oh yeah?” you ask cheekily aided by the effect of gin. He still has your heart racing but a part of you now knows that the feeling is mutual. “What did you say again?”   He sees that glint in your eye and it causes him to smirk. “Why don’t I make it simple for you darling?” He closes the distance one hand brushing the hair from your face.   “Okay” you swallow getting lost in his blues.   “I missed you.” He kisses your cheek. “I like you. A lot.” He kisses the other. “And I uh I would like to take you on a date.”  His eyes meet yours. His voice is steady but you notice some nervousness in his gaze. How the tables have turned. You make Ewan Mitchell’s heart go awry.   “Please darling?” he timidly adds the sentiment so sweet you want to blurt out yes immediately. Before you can he’s already leaned back an explanation rushing out of his lips “And… I’m not sure but you must have seen those headlines? They’re not true I swear. We were out drinking and - ”  “I know Ewan.” You cut him off with a hand pressed gently on his chest but he keeps going.   “ - some other people joined us. One of them being - ”  “Luke and Elliott’s cousin. I know. Elliott called and told me everything.”  “Oh. He called you?” A huge sense of relief washes over him better than any comfort he might have found in a shot or three of bourbon.   “Mhmm he called me yesterday. So you know you didn’t really have to fly out. I was about to call you eventually.”  He smiles bashfully eyes cast down as a blush spreads across his cheeks. Damn it Elliott you brilliant lad. He reminds himself to treat Elliott to a pint the next time he sees him.   “I still wanted to see you” Ewan maintains pressing a kiss to your forehead and you’re immediately enveloped by the familiar comfort of his scent. Surprisingly without the staple hint of cigarette smoke due to his frantic scrubbing after the flight.   “I’m happy you’re here” you say wrapping your arms around his waist cheek pressed against his chest. “And no offence to Louise or anything but she needs to learn some boundaries with my - ”  Ewan looks down at you fondly squeezing your arms to prompt your next words “Yeah darling? Your what?”  “My - ” you attempt to bury your face in his hoodie but he keeps your gaze with a hand cupping your jaw. So you end up saving yourself with “ - my Aemond.”  “Hmm” he hums lips curling and it’s so very Aemond of him it makes you feel warm all over. “Your Aemond.Your Ewan. I’m all yours love.”  The whole thing couldn’t have gone any better all things considered and Ewan feels content to have gotten over his first brush with the rumour mill. What matters is right in front of him and you know the truth.   “Are you staying in this hotel? How did you even know I was here?” You take his hand guiding him over to the couch.  “Clara” is all Ewan says by way of explanation.  “Well thank you Clara” you declare. Ewan shuffles closer to you and rests his arm around your shoulders planting a kiss on your forehead again. The gesture is already becoming instinctive providing the both of you with a sense of ease.  “Darling?”  “Yeah?” you respond absentmindedly fingers toying with the soft fabric of his hoodie.   “Is that a yes?”  You exhale deeply. As if it wasn’t clear enough already. “What do you think handsome?”  “I don’t know angel. You tell me” he counters cheekily his fingers playing with your hair as you playfully glare at him.  “What if I say no baby?”  “Then I’ll have to work hard to change your mind princess.”  “And how would you do that honey?”  His gaze darkens and something flashes across his blue eyes as he whispers intensely “Use your imagination bunny.”   “Ri-right” you bite your lip then shake your head to snap out of it. “We’ll have to draw the line at bunny.”  He laughs at your flustered state pleased by the effect he has on you. “What’s wrong with bunny?”  That elicits a groan out of you but you smile anyway. “I already said yes Ewan. Quit it with the bunny.”  “Alright beautiful” he relents making you lean even closer against him.   The haze of gin after a long work day starts to subside and the rush of emotion is coming back to you. You find yourself gazing at Ewan in mild disbelief in awe that he just confessed that he wants you.   Feeling antsy you stand and pace around the room. You start tidying things putting your scattered knick-knacks back in your handbag. If you sit with him any longer you just might end up hurrying things through and jump his bones already kiss him the next time he does that hmm.   “Can I get you anything?” you ask.   “No” he says smoothly. “I just need you.” The words make you stop in your tracks. He still sits in the same position looking at you with that undeniable desire in his eyes.  “Uhhhm” your mouth feels dry all of the sudden. Nothing his tongue past your lips can’t fix your intrusive thoughts barge right in. “So… the… the media rollout’s still going on isn’t it? Should we check and see?” You take your laptop and plop back down next to him. He doesn’t miss a beat and cuddles against you once more wrapping his arm around your tense frame.   “I think so darling.” The media rollout is how the interviews and promotional material filmed by the cast is being released gradually on a weekly basis after each new episode comes out.   A simple search on Youtube confirms it and the first thing that popped up is the Where is The Lie? video you did for Elle.   It was slated for just Tom Phia and Ewan but your Blackwood character became such a fan-favourite that they asked you to join in. Not to mention the frenzy you and Ewan caused online with the initial interviews you did together.   “Shall we watch this?” Ewan offers solely for the intent of seeing you in the video.  You click on it and for the next 8 minutes or so all you can take note of are the signs that had clearly already been there. The fans were on to something when they claimed that you and Ewan are a really good ship.   The video starts with a clip of Phia hitting her head on the overhead lamp when she stands prompting her to uncontrollably giggle along with you and Tom. Ewan being the exception is beside himself with worry and he appears to instinctively reach for your hand as you sit beside him.   “Huh” Ewan smiles taking your hand and pressing a kiss to the back of it.   Tom is the first to be put on the hot seat and he slowly recites the three statements he prepared. “Ewan pay attention” Tom blurts out when he notices that Ewan kept sneaking glances at you. “Sure I’m locked in” Ewan says right back as you and Phia share a look.   “What were you looking at?” you ask playfully poking him in the side. “You seem plenty distracted there.”  He snorts at himself in the video when he ends up smiling as he caught your eye. “It was your fault. You were distracting me.”  “I was not!” you exclaim. “I thought you were just being competitive then.”  Phia is next to have a go. She tells you of a Wifi repellent necklace a wrestling career and saving a squirrel from a drainpipe. “The Wifi thing sounds like something Ewan would have” Tom jokes. “Oh sure” you concur “except that he’d actually keep it so he can watch films.” Ewan smiles at your acute observation.   “I’d also keep it to stalk your Instagram” Ewan mumbles from beside you. “And you know just stalk you in general.”  “I’m sure you do Mitchell” you respond casually but your face warms up anyhow.   It’s Ewan’s turn and as he sits on the hot seat you see Tom and Phia casting a look at each other then at the two of you a secret message shared between them. “I bet she will know the answer right away” Phia says. “Yeah how do we know the two of you didn’t conspire together?” Tom asks. “Are you kidding me you guys?” you laugh at them thinking how silly they were being not knowing then that they were definitely on to something.   “Darling you have to know this” Ewan tells you specifically as you all try to guess the answer. “Oh darling!” Tom mouths to Phia dramatically flipping nonexistent long hair over his shoulder. Phia laughs at his antics before nudging you and saying “Which one is it? Which is the lie? I trust you.” You respond “Why me? You two should know this too!”  “Because I wasn’t trying to date them my love” Ewan says smiling at the screen.   “Oh come on now.” You crane your neck up to press a soft kiss against his cheek before turning your attention back to the video. So you don’t notice the switch in Ewan’s breathing. The jumps in his heartbeart. The way he subtly clears his throat to deal with his flustered state.  The video comes to a close after your turn and even at the very end Ewan can be seen admiring you as you give the closing remarks with Phia.  Admiring you as he does in the moment.   “You’re beautiful you know that?” he says when you turn to look at him.   “Thank you” you reply softly your voice barely audible.   Some time passes with the two of you catching up talking about your upcoming projects his big meeting in New York - all the while his fingers trace patterns on your exposed skin his arm wrapped around you snugly.   “Have you been keeping up with the show?” he asks.  “The last episode I saw fully was… the second one? I got pretty busy after that. How about you?”  “Oh” he looks down in thought piquing your curiosity “so you didn’t get to see the third episode yet then?”  “No not yet” you shake your head “but I’ve seen some stuff here and there.”  He hums again and he wants to ask have you seen his stuff? There are around a dozen or so potential jokes at play here. He has an inkling to tell you to watch the episode so you can see just what you’re in for. So you can see him and all he has to offer. He’d also fumble through a justification as he had done in some interview about the new studio they had filmed in being cold as a fridge freezer.  What to say? What to say? He picks at some lint on his jeans smirking to himself.   “Yeah” you eventually giggle at his obvious hesitation. “I’ve only seen some of the episode. But what I’ve seen… is enough to make me jealous of Madame Sylvie.”  He stiffens throat suddenly dry but one look at your smile does away with his concerns.   He soon finds himself laughing a muffled “Oh darling” whispered lovingly against your hair.  “That was very brave of you Ewan” you express sincerely.   “Thank you love.”  “So… just how cold was it in there?”  Your shared unrestrained laughter echo throughout the room.   ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎  Your first date was meant to happen the following night but such is the nature of the job that Ewan’s schedule gets moved up all of a sudden.  Once the bigshot casting director in New York found out that Ewan is already stateside he requested that the meeting be held at the earliest possible opportunity.  He calls you while you are in rehearsals profusely apologizing and promising to fly back to LA in the next two days right after his meeting is all sorted.  “It’s okay Ewan” you reassure him genuinely understanding. “I will see you when you come back. Good luck I know you’re going to smash it whatever opportunity this is!”  “Thank you darling” he says already wanting to have you back in his arms already mentally kicking himself for not kissing you when he had about a hundred chances to do so. “I’m going to miss you.”  “I’ll miss you too” you respond blushing silly with the phone pressed to your ear. “But it’ll only be two days.”  “Hmm doesn’t matter. I need to take you on our bloody date darling. I’ve already taken so damn long.”  “Don’t worry” you say “I’ve already seen you way more than I should before the first date.”  “Wha - ” a protest forms on his lips but he gets your point right away. “Oh. Clever darling.”  “I know.”  “But I’m planning to give you something that’s just for you. That the whole world won’t ever be privy to.”  You swallow hard your very being heating up at his insinuation. “Don’t make promises you can’t keep Mitchell.”  “I guess you’ll just have to wait and see.”  Bonus chapter!

No doubt she felt Corlys pull away she knows something isn’t right she feels increasingly more and more isolated from him. And now she knows why: he’s been dealing with this - the fact that his bastard son saved his life and he’s been trying to keep it from her (not knowing that even if she didn’t know Alyn saved Corlys’s life he does exist).   Is this why you came? To subject me to an inquisition?  That flash of anger the accusation he throws at her is probably the most he’s actually given to her unfiltered all season. His blood has never heated before then. But it’s in there that she finds honesty. It’s in Corlys’s anger always that Rhaenys is able to find vulnerability. He’s anticipating her reaction. He’s defensive against her reaction because he’s thought about what this truth could possibly do to them. Like a wounded animal striking out.  Rhaenys has known he’s been wounded. She knows he’s not been right. And it’s not all to do with this of course. But this is the thing she didn’t know he’d been dealing with. She knew about all the othe griefs and insecurities.  And she just looks at him. Because the puzzle pieces have slotted into place and even though Rhaenys is hurting and this does (absolutely) hurt her… she can see it hurts him as well and it’s been hurting him for a long time.,2024-07-12 09:09:26 GMT

REFLECTING ON YOUR JOURNEY IN THE ACTING INDUSTRY DO YOU REMEMBER THE MOMENT YOU REALIZED YOU REALIZED YOU WANTED TO PURSUE ACTING?  “The moment I realized I wanted to pursue acting was probably when I was around 12 years old in high school.” “I was performing in a production of Shakespeare’s Macbeth at the Royal Exchange in Manchester.” “I saw older actors and wondered what their &quot;proper” jobs were outside of the theater.“ ‘When I asked one of them they said’: — &quot;No this is my proper job. This is what I do.” “I didn’t know people could do that.” “From that moment on I knew that this is what I wanted to do as a career.” YOU’VE DONE MULTIPLE SHOWS AND MOVIES IN THE DRAMATIC GENRE. WOULD YOU EVER BE OPEN TO DOING OTHER GENRES?  “Absolutely I’d love to explore new genres in the future.” “I’d love to give comedy a go.” “I think that would be a good challenge.” “It’s difficult because timing is crucial delivering a joke at the right time can feel almost mathematical.” “But I think that good comedy actors don’t see it that way at all.” “It just comes naturally to them.” “I’d love to give it a shot.” “I’m also interested in doing biopics bringing real-life stories to life.” “Chet Baker and Gene Kelly in particular would be fascinating characters to portray.” “But I’m open to any interesting projects that come my way.” HOW DO YOU CHOOSE THE ROLES YOU TAKE ON? ARE YOU DRAWN TO A PARTICULAR TYPE OF CHARACTER OR STORY?  “Honestly I’m drawn to anything that makes me feel uncomfortable and pushes me out of my comfort zone.” “I seek out roles where the character feels distant and challenging.” “I like to test myself and see if I can bring such characters to life.” “If a role feels like something I might struggle with that’s exactly what I want to tackle.” “I often joke that these challenging roles might be my downfall someday.” laughs CAN YOU SHARE ANY INSIGHTS INTO HOW YOUR CHARACTER AEGON II TARGARYEN ENVOLVES IN THE UPCOMING SEASON?  “I found it fascinating to delve deeper into Aegon this season because there’s so much more to uncover about him.” “In the first season we saw quite a two-dimensional view of Aegon—not due to Ty Tennant’s portrayal which I thought was fantastic bringing a lot of vulnerability and teenage angst to the character.” “When I took over the time frame was too short to really explore Aegon’s complexities.” “This time I’ve had an extended period to sit with the character and dig into his deeper layers.” “Playing a character experiencing profound grief is always a challenge.” “I’m lucky enough that I’ve never gone through anything like that myself so I had to imagine it as vividly as possible.” “This season Aegon is shown as more of an empath than a psychopath.” “It becomes clear that he has the capacity to love feel and grieve.” “There are so many comparisons between Aegon and Richard II.” “People are saying Aegon is cold calculated and evil and while he’s certainly done horrible things—I’m not justifying any of those—it’s important to note that rather than being a straightforward villain he’s a crumbling tragedy.” HOW HAS YOUR APPROACH TO PORTRAYING AEGON II CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS SEASON TO THE NEW ONE?  “There’s definitely a continuation of the drama and theatricality from season one.” “It’s huge rousing and intense.” “I’ve seen episodes one to four and they are just unbelievable especially the battle scenes — you can’t get any bigger than that.” “This season though there’s also an element of humor.” “At some point they called Aegon &#x27;the Magnanimous’ and it was important to bring some levity to his character.” “Aegon has just stepped into the role of King and is trying to figure it all out.” “We’re at a point where he’s found a spring in his step enjoying this new responsibility and purpose.” “He’s also got a lot of power now.” “Power can go to people’s heads and make them crazy.” “It was nice to explore his boyishness and playfulness as it gives his character more depth and leaves room for growth.” WHAT WOULD YOU TELL PEOPLE TO GET THEM ON TEAM GREEN?  “I don’t think I need to persuade them—obviously we’re the best.” “But if you really want to see why this season is packed with surprises that will make it clear.” SINCE THE SHOW IS BASED ORIGINALLY ON BOOKS IS THERE A SPECIFIC BOOK YOU’D LIKE TO SEE BROUGHT TO THE SCREEN AND FOR YOU TO BE A PART OF?  “I’d love to see a film adaptation of Douglas Stuart’s book Shuggie Bain.” “Another great choice would be The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet by David Mitchell.” “It’s a collection of beautiful and heart-wrenching short stories and each one could make a compelling film.” “Looking at my bookshelf now I see a lot of books on Bob Dylan David Bowie and Paul McCartney—mostly singer-songwriters.” “I also have a lot of poetry. I’d love to see a biopic of Patti Smith.” “That would be incredible.” YOUR CAREER HAS TAKEN YOU TO VARIOUS FILMING LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. IS THERE A SPECIFIC LOCATION YOU HAVEN’T BEEN TO YET AND WOULD LOVE TO BE THE BACKDROP FOR A POTENTIAL FUTURE PROYECT?  “Oh that’s a good question.” “I think somewhere that’s a hybrid between beautiful rolling countryside and the coast.” “A place that offers both stunning landscapes and the sea.” “On your days off you could go for a swim or hike through the mountains.” “I’d love to work in a scenic and peaceful location like that.” SOMETIMES ACTORS WHO PLAY &#x27;VILLAINS’ CAN GET AN ADVERSE REACTION FROM SOME FANS OF A SHOW. WHAT HAVE YOUR INTERACTIONS BEEN LIKE?  “I’ve been very lucky.” “Many people have approached me with kind words about my portrayal of Aegon.” “It’s a challenging task to humanize someone so seemingly poisonous.” “Fortunately I haven’t had negative encounters with fans who can’t differentiate between the character and the actor.” “I think we’re in a different phase in society now.” “When Jack Gleeson played Joffrey there was less social media presence making it harder for audiences to separate the actor from the character.” “Today I think we are a more technologically advanced community with more behind-the-scenes and a better understanding of the distinction between actor and character.” “I think people have copped on. I hope that’s the case anyway.” YOU’VE COLLABORATED WITH RENOWNED DIRECTORS LIKE CHRISTOPHER NOLAN. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM THESE EXPERIENCES?  “Doing Dunkirk was my first significant experience on a film set.” “I really didn’t know where to start.” “The canvas was completely blank.” “And it was just such a gift a pinch me moment that I was able to learn from some of if not the best filmmaker in the world.” “It was overwhelming.” “And I had to remind myself to be present and soak in everything like a sponge.” “Chris’s patience and the support from the rest of the cast were invaluable throughout.” “We were all in it together especially us young lads who were new to such a big production.” “We learned and grew together during that incredible experience.” IN THE KING YOU PORTRAYED A HISTORICAL FIGURE. HOW DID YOU APPROACH BRINGING THIS CHARACTER TO LIFE?  “When portraying a fictional character there’s often more freedom because there’s no definitive blueprint to follow—even if they’re written in a book they’re still fictional.” “You can infuse your own understanding and personality into the role.” “However there’s added pressure when it comes to a historical figure because you’re portraying someone real.” “I never let that pressure overwhelm or hinder the process.” “Instead I took the character as presented and focused on doing my best with the role.” A NEW HUNGER GAMES MOVIE WAS JUST ANNOUNCED SPECIFICALLY A PREQUEL FOCUSING ON HAYMITCH’S STORY AND MANY FANS ARE EAGER TO SEE YOU IN THAT ROLE. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?  “No way that’s the first I’ve heard of it! But I’m incredibly flattered that people would like to see me on screen again.” “If all goes well I’ll fight for my life in the Hunger Games!” laugh WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE SHOWS DURING YOUR DOWNTIME?  “One show I watch repeatedly and it never gets old for me is the UK version of The Office.” “The humor is very relatable and comforting to me.” “I even laugh just thinking about it. It’s one of those TV shows when it finishes you’re like: — “Oh no! What do I do with my life? I miss the characters already.” laugh &quot;I also enjoy the US version of The Office.” “Besides that I’m fascinated by farming documentaries.” “Shows like This Farming Life on BBC are incredibly calming for me.” “And I have to mention The Great Pottery Throwdown — I’m a bit of a pottery nerd and that show is brilliant!

Idk if it’s pressure to fit everything into ten 1 hr episodes(which they don’t need to limit themselves to in the first place) but I just want to see more of these relationships and characters because they’re all so interesting. Ex: Harwin and Rhaenyra barely interact for 3 minutes of total screen time despite having 3 children+ I feel like the writers have to force themselves to make Helaena have a moment with either of her brothers as if she and Aegon didn’t loose a son together and Aemond wasn’t the indirect cause of that sons death.,2024-07-12 09:54:10 GMT

Will the two finally have their first date or will something get in the way once more?  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Ewan’s publicist Donna has never had any issue with her client before. Always present and accounted for on time for whatever interview photoshoot or audition he has booked for the day.   But she hasn’t been able to get a hold of him in the past two days which is worrying her to no end because he is set to meet with a major casting director in New York some time in the coming week.  Donna may have a clue as to why. It’s only been two days as well since the pub incident when The Sun ran a story speculating on Ewan’s lovelife - the exact kind of thing he’s always been trying to avoid.   It had taken a life of its own with fans taking it upon themselves to track down every clue of the girl on the internet. Her instagram. Her relation to the cast - apparently she is a cousin of Luke and Elliott. Even the marketing agency where she works. Louise a 26-year old graphic designer admittedly harbours a crush on Ewan and when she heard that her cousins were hanging out with him at a pub nearby she almost immediately invited herself and her friends over.   But that’s all according to Ewan. After talking to Luke memories of the night came rushing back to him.   Stumbling out in the alley to send you that voice message. Rejoining the boys to see that they’ve got new company. Being introduced to Louise with Tom joking that he should be careful with the missus. Wouldn’t want her - you - to think that he’s flirting with anyone else.   Even though that’s exactly what happened. Not the flirting per se. Not from Ewan’s side at least. Louise had been brazen with admiration barely leaving his side the rest of the night. Asking him a bunch of probing questions he had neither the interest nor the patience to answer.   They had all thought the pub was safe from prying eyes. No one approached them for anything not even a single look of recognition followed by the question “Are you that guy from House of the Dragon?” Unfortunately it only takes one rat for a headline to surface. Ewan Mitchell’s mystery girl has been the talk of the fandom and Donna has been trying hard to quell the rumours.   Such is the nasty nature of the business as she knows Ewan has quickly learned.   She dials him again and to her surprise the call actually patches through.  Her client’s throaty voice is heard on the other line “Hey Donna sorry if I’ve missed your calls.”  “It’s alright it’s alright Ewan” Donna stammers. “Just glad to hear from you. Where are you? I’ve managed to do some damage control about those rumours and - ”  “Oh I’m in LA. I just landed about an hour ago” Ewan responds casually not mirroring the stress in Donna’s tone. Has he gotten over the fuss so easily?  “LA? You know your meeting is not till next week right? And it’s in New York. It’s very very important that you don’t miss it Ewan.”  “And I won’t” Ewan affirms laughing dryly to console his worried publicist. “I just need to see about something over here.”   Someone he thinks. He’s got his priorities straight.  “Work-related?” Donna asks curious.  “Uhhhm” Ewan dithers but decides against telling her about you. Not just yet. “Just visiting a friend. I’ll stay here for a while then fly out to New York don’t worry.”  “Okay just keep in touch alright? I’ll send more details about the meeting soon.”  “Sure thing. Thank you Donna.”   “Talk soon Ewan. Take care of yourself.”  Donna feels a huge sense of relief wash over her when the call ends knowing the whereabouts of one of her biggest clients. But why LA? Perhaps Ewan just needed some time off after the flurry of annoying headlines put out in the UK.  Or maybe he’s visiting with a friend? Who is stateside right now? Fabien’s filming in Philly. The rest of the boys are still in England. But then…  Her thoughts land on the one thing - the one person - that would make him fly out on such short notice. Without giving thought to anything else especially after the speculation on his romantic life.  Ewan’s never been one to share about personal affairs not even to his close-knit team but no matter how reclusive he is no one can deny the way he looks at you. The way he lights up when you’re brought up in conversation. The number of times he had excused himself from their meetings to make a call standing in the corner with a permanent smile etched on his face.   Oh Donna knows now just who he is in LA for.   ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎  Like inevitable spectres haunting someone of his profession Ewan noticed the papparazzi snapping away as he arrived in LA.   He told no one he would be coming so it must be an automatic thing in the city. The photogs are always scurrying in the periphery ready to catch anyone of note no matter the degree of fame or notoriety.  If you were keeping up with such news you would know he is in the city.   But according to your assistant Clara who was kind enough to inform him of your schedule you are still finishing up on another day of rehearsals for your upcoming rom-com. Ewan checked in the same hotel as you planning to seek you out as soon as you arrive back from work.  He hasn’t spoken to you since the voicemail and since those false news broke out. Not that he can blame you - wouldn’t anyone be suspicious of a drunken confession made by a guy who was allegedly in the company of another girl?  He hates it being subject to all of this. This nonsense that is keeping you from him not even worth any consequence.  But he will deal with the blows. As long as he sets things right with you. As long he gets you in the end.   He settles in his suite getting ready to meet with you once more. He showers shaves tousles his hair. He even checks whether he smells decent after all of that - once twice and another time. Being nervous to stand in front of a crowd is one thing; it’s a whole other conundrum for him finally see you again.   Maybe the crowds are more manageable and it baffles him to realise so. He can put on a persona be the actor and disappear inside himself as the cameras flash bright enough for him to disassociate.  But not with you. He wants to show you everything that he is who he truly is and it scares him. There is no team to help him get ready now. It’s all him just Ewan.   Clad in his trusty black jeans and a comfortable hoodie of the same dark colour he looks in the mirror one last time after receiving a text from Clara that you’ve arrived at the hotel about half an hour ago.  He contemplates opening the bottle of bourbon from the minibar and taking a shot of liquid courage - something to help him get his explanation ready. Just so he wouldn’t stammer in front of you.   Just so you he can make you see without any error or trace of doubt that he meant every word in that voicemail no matter how embarrassing it might have sounded.  He decides against it imagining the wrinkling of your nose as you catch a whiff of the alcohol. It’s cute when you do it and he adores it so dearly but he knows that it isn’t the right moment.  He rights himself rolls his shoulders and he’s out the door.   ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎  Jacob trails you inside your hotel suite laughing at some shared remark about the scenes you rehearsed for the day.  They were emotionally demanding and even after tossing around ideas for hours the two of you were unable to achieve a satisfying approach to the scenes.  Which is why he had proposed practicing well into the evening and you found yourselves heading back to your suite together. He has his own house in LA but your hotel just happened to be closer to the rehearsal studio.   “Care for a drink?” you asked him.  “Why the hell not?” he immediately assents in that easy Aussie drawl. “We might need it for this shite.”  You laugh in agreement “Indeed. I’ve got some canned gin and tonics if that’s alright.. or beer… or whiskey… ” you trail off as you study the contents of your fridge.  “G and t please mate” he settles down on the couch legs stretching in front of him. “We were so unproductive today. I just could not get that line right.”  “Tell me about it.” You hand him his drink and he clinks it with yours with a mumbled cheers. “It was me who can’t land the right tone” you say. “I mean is my character supposed to be confused in that moment? Or angry? Or sad?”  “Or all of ‘em.” he shrugs. “Tricky isn’t it?”  You hurriedly fetch your script from a table getting right down to it. “So for the first scene in the third act…”   Moments later with cans of gin and tonic discarded on the coffee table you and Jacob sit with legs crossed on the couch facing each other. Scripts in hand you go through the lines over and over with only seemingly minor tweaks each time. To an actor though even just the slightest change of pitch or expression makes all the difference.  “Is that better? I think we almost got it” you say after a read-through.   “Yeah so much better” he grins holding his hand up for a high-five. Just as your hands smack in the air another sound echoes faintly from the door.   “Someone’s knocking?” Jacob asks. “You expecting anybody? Room service or anything?”  “No” you shake your head trying to think of whether your assistant or publicist said anything about dropping by. “Maybe it’s just housekeeping?”  “I’ll get it” Jacob states already padding his way to the door.  A beat later you hear Jacob loudly exclaim “Ewan mate! It’s good to see you!”  Ewan? A shiver runs up your spine. Craning your neck to get a view of a doorway you catch sight of him half-obscured by Jacob’s tall frame.   Confused surprised and feeling some other emotion you can’t pinpoint you head over to greet him.   “How are you doing?” Jacob greets shaking Ewan’s hand oblivious to the poorly hidden distaste in his eyes.   “Wh-what are you doing here?” Ewan finds himself asking Jacob a bit rudely just as you ask him the same.   “What are you doing here?” you mirror his question at the exact same time.  “Oh!” Jacob breathes out a laugh “Well I’ll go first. We were just practicing lines.”  “In her room? Isn’t it a bit late for rehearsal? I thought you’re supposed to be off work.” Ewan asks and it sounds like an accusation. He starts to feel all kinds of uneasy - were the twins right about life imitating art?   You narrow your eyes at him. “We decided to continue running lines after rehearsal. There’s a scene we can’t get right. It’s quite tricky - ”  “Just the two of you? Alone here?” Ewan tilts his head gesturing towards the room like it’s some forbidden place.  Jacob shakes his head smile steady on his lips. If he’s caught on to how Ewan must be feeling he doesn’t let it affect him. He gives you a look as if to check your reaction and you give him a reassuring shrug.  Ewan does not overlook this exchange. He clenches his jaw irate from the assumptions popping up in his mind. Before he forgets his manners he says “Excuse me I just… wasn’t expecting… I just wanted to speak to you.”  “I didn’t even know you were in LA” you say before moving aside to usher him in. “But I’m glad you are of course. Come join us - ”  He nods making his way to the seating area where he spies the discarded cans of alcohol and dog-eared scripts. Maybe he should have taken that bloody shot after all.   He laughs joylessly to himself shaking his head. “Sorry you guys. I just flew in today and I must have been exhausted from the flight.”  “Hey no worries mate” Jacob says. “You know what I’ll be on my way. Give you time to catch up and all.” He picks up his own tattered script then gives you a kiss on the cheek bidding you with a “I’ll see you tomorrow. Have a good night sweetheart.”   If looks could kill and if his dear mother hadn’t raised him right he would have incinerated Jacob in that moment.   He is snapped out of his thoughts when Jacob claps him on the shoulder “Great to see you again mate. Have a good night eh?”  Ewan knows he’s being ridiculous. There’s nothing wrong with two friends and co-stars spending some time alone to rehearse. Besides last he heard you were adamant that you and Jacob are just friends.   So why is he being so irrational? Why does the idea of you spending more time than necessary with Jacob possibly falling for him bother him so much?   Ewan realises that this is what jealousy must feel like.   He’s had career envy before. Another actor landing a role he vied for. Someone else getting the praise he deserves.   But nothing like this. It’s petty and possessive.   He wants you to just be his.   You stand in front of him once more after you walk Jacob out of the suite.   “Hey” you say smiling weakly.   “Hi darling.”  Both of you want to do more. Say more. Usually you would greet each other with a hug and a kiss on a cheek his hands lingering on your forearms even after you pull away but the air is thick with tension.  You look at him with those bright expecting eyes of yours and Ewan just wants to cave in and make a sloppy confession. But not after that voicemail no. He’s determined to do this right. Words not slurred head clear.   “So I got your voicemail” you finally say smiling coyly. “That was… something.”  “Hmm” he can’t help but mirror your smile as always. “It was wasn’t it?”  “I understand” you continue taking a step closer “if you were drunk. We all say things when we’re off it that we maybe don’t mean - ”  “But darling I meant every word” he says way too quickly.   You laugh the sound of it erasing whatever apprehension remained in him. “Do you even remember what you said?”  “I do” he counters moving even closer to you. Another step and he’d be able to wrap his arms around your waist and pull you to him. “At least some of - no - most of it.”  “Oh yeah?” you ask cheekily aided by the effect of gin. He still has your heart racing but a part of you now knows that the feeling is mutual. “What did you say again?”   He sees that glint in your eye and it causes him to smirk. “Why don’t I make it simple for you darling?” He closes the distance one hand brushing the hair from your face.   “Okay” you swallow getting lost in his blues.   “I missed you.” He kisses your cheek. “I like you. A lot.” He kisses the other. “And I uh I would like to take you on a date.”  His eyes meet yours. His voice is steady but you notice some nervousness in his gaze. How the tables have turned. You make Ewan Mitchell’s heart go awry.   “Please darling?” he timidly adds the sentiment so sweet you want to blurt out yes immediately. Before you can he’s already leaned back an explanation rushing out of his lips “And… I’m not sure but you must have seen those headlines? They’re not true I swear. We were out drinking and - ”  “I know Ewan.” You cut him off with a hand pressed gently on his chest but he keeps going.   “ - some other people joined us. One of them being - ”  “Luke and Elliott’s cousin. I know. Elliott called and told me everything.”  “Oh. He called you?” A huge sense of relief washes over him better than any comfort he might have found in a shot or three of bourbon.   “Mhmm he called me yesterday. So you know you didn’t really have to fly out. I was about to call you eventually.”  He smiles bashfully eyes cast down as a blush spreads across his cheeks. Damn it Elliott you brilliant lad. He reminds himself to treat Elliott to a pint the next time he sees him.   “I still wanted to see you” Ewan maintains pressing a kiss to your forehead and you’re immediately enveloped by the familiar comfort of his scent. Surprisingly without the staple hint of cigarette smoke due to his frantic scrubbing after the flight.   “I’m happy you’re here” you say wrapping your arms around his waist cheek pressed against his chest. “And no offence to Louise or anything but she needs to learn some boundaries with my - ”  Ewan looks down at you fondly squeezing your arms to prompt your next words “Yeah darling? Your what?”  “My - ” you attempt to bury your face in his hoodie but he keeps your gaze with a hand cupping your jaw. So you end up saving yourself with “ - my Aemond.”  “Hmm” he hums lips curling and it’s so very Aemond of him it makes you feel warm all over. “Your Aemond.Your Ewan. I’m all yours love.”  The whole thing couldn’t have gone any better all things considered and Ewan feels content to have gotten over his first brush with the rumour mill. What matters is right in front of him and you know the truth.   “Are you staying in this hotel? How did you even know I was here?” You take his hand guiding him over to the couch.  “Clara” is all Ewan says by way of explanation.  “Well thank you Clara” you declare. Ewan shuffles closer to you and rests his arm around your shoulders planting a kiss on your forehead again. The gesture is already becoming instinctive providing the both of you with a sense of ease.  “Darling?”  “Yeah?” you respond absentmindedly fingers toying with the soft fabric of his hoodie.   “Is that a yes?”  You exhale deeply. As if it wasn’t clear enough already. “What do you think handsome?”  “I don’t know angel. You tell me” he counters cheekily his fingers playing with your hair as you playfully glare at him.  “What if I say no baby?”  “Then I’ll have to work hard to change your mind princess.”  “And how would you do that honey?”  His gaze darkens and something flashes across his blue eyes as he whispers intensely “Use your imagination bunny.”   “Ri-right” you bite your lip then shake your head to snap out of it. “We’ll have to draw the line at bunny.”  He laughs at your flustered state pleased by the effect he has on you. “What’s wrong with bunny?”  That elicits a groan out of you but you smile anyway. “I already said yes Ewan. Quit it with the bunny.”  “Alright beautiful” he relents making you lean even closer against him.   The haze of gin after a long work day starts to subside and the rush of emotion is coming back to you. You find yourself gazing at Ewan in mild disbelief in awe that he just confessed that he wants you.   Feeling antsy you stand and pace around the room. You start tidying things putting your scattered knick-knacks back in your handbag. If you sit with him any longer you just might end up hurrying things through and jump his bones already kiss him the next time he does that hmm.   “Can I get you anything?” you ask.   “No” he says smoothly. “I just need you.” The words make you stop in your tracks. He still sits in the same position looking at you with that undeniable desire in his eyes.  “Uhhhm” your mouth feels dry all of the sudden. Nothing his tongue past your lips can’t fix your intrusive thoughts barge right in. “So… the… the media rollout’s still going on isn’t it? Should we check and see?” You take your laptop and plop back down next to him. He doesn’t miss a beat and cuddles against you once more wrapping his arm around your tense frame.   “I think so darling.” The media rollout is how the interviews and promotional material filmed by the cast is being released gradually on a weekly basis after each new episode comes out.   A simple search on Youtube confirms it and the first thing that popped up is the Where is The Lie? video you did for Elle.   It was slated for just Tom Phia and Ewan but your Blackwood character became such a fan-favourite that they asked you to join in. Not to mention the frenzy you and Ewan caused online with the initial interviews you did together.   “Shall we watch this?” Ewan offers solely for the intent of seeing you in the video.  You click on it and for the next 8 minutes or so all you can take note of are the signs that had clearly already been there. The fans were on to something when they claimed that you and Ewan are a really good ship.   The video starts with a clip of Phia hitting her head on the overhead lamp when she stands prompting her to uncontrollably giggle along with you and Tom. Ewan being the exception is beside himself with worry and he appears to instinctively reach for your hand as you sit beside him.   “Huh” Ewan smiles taking your hand and pressing a kiss to the back of it.   Tom is the first to be put on the hot seat and he slowly recites the three statements he prepared. “Ewan pay attention” Tom blurts out when he notices that Ewan kept sneaking glances at you. “Sure I’m locked in” Ewan says right back as you and Phia share a look.   “What were you looking at?” you ask playfully poking him in the side. “You seem plenty distracted there.”  He snorts at himself in the video when he ends up smiling as he caught your eye. “It was your fault. You were distracting me.”  “I was not!” you exclaim. “I thought you were just being competitive then.”  Phia is next to have a go. She tells you of a Wifi repellent necklace a wrestling career and saving a squirrel from a drainpipe. “The Wifi thing sounds like something Ewan would have” Tom jokes. “Oh sure” you concur “except that he’d actually keep it so he can watch films.” Ewan smiles at your acute observation.   “I’d also keep it to stalk your Instagram” Ewan mumbles from beside you. “And you know just stalk you in general.”  “I’m sure you do Mitchell” you respond casually but your face warms up anyhow.   It’s Ewan’s turn and as he sits on the hot seat you see Tom and Phia casting a look at each other then at the two of you a secret message shared between them. “I bet she will know the answer right away” Phia says. “Yeah how do we know the two of you didn’t conspire together?” Tom asks. “Are you kidding me you guys?” you laugh at them thinking how silly they were being not knowing then that they were definitely on to something.   “Darling you have to know this” Ewan tells you specifically as you all try to guess the answer. “Oh darling!” Tom mouths to Phia dramatically flipping nonexistent long hair over his shoulder. Phia laughs at his antics before nudging you and saying “Which one is it? Which is the lie? I trust you.” You respond “Why me? You two should know this too!”  “Because I wasn’t trying to date them my love” Ewan says smiling at the screen.   “Oh come on now.” You crane your neck up to press a soft kiss against his cheek before turning your attention back to the video. So you don’t notice the switch in Ewan’s breathing. The jumps in his heartbeart. The way he subtly clears his throat to deal with his flustered state.  The video comes to a close after your turn and even at the very end Ewan can be seen admiring you as you give the closing remarks with Phia.  Admiring you as he does in the moment.   “You’re beautiful you know that?” he says when you turn to look at him.   “Thank you” you reply softly your voice barely audible.   Some time passes with the two of you catching up talking about your upcoming projects his big meeting in New York - all the while his fingers trace patterns on your exposed skin his arm wrapped around you snugly.   “Have you been keeping up with the show?” he asks.  “The last episode I saw fully was… the second one? I got pretty busy after that. How about you?”  “Oh” he looks down in thought piquing your curiosity “so you didn’t get to see the third episode yet then?”  “No not yet” you shake your head “but I’ve seen some stuff here and there.”  He hums again and he wants to ask have you seen his stuff? There are around a dozen or so potential jokes at play here. He has an inkling to tell you to watch the episode so you can see just what you’re in for. So you can see him and all he has to offer. He’d also fumble through a justification as he had done in some interview about the new studio they had filmed in being cold as a fridge freezer.  What to say? What to say? He picks at some lint on his jeans smirking to himself.   “Yeah” you eventually giggle at his obvious hesitation. “I’ve only seen some of the episode. But what I’ve seen… is enough to make me jealous of Madame Sylvie.”  He stiffens throat suddenly dry but one look at your smile does away with his concerns.   He soon finds himself laughing a muffled “Oh darling” whispered lovingly against your hair.  “That was very brave of you Ewan” you express sincerely.   “Thank you love.”  “So… just how cold was it in there?”  Your shared unrestrained laughter echo throughout the room.   ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎  Your first date was meant to happen the following night but such is the nature of the job that Ewan’s schedule gets moved up all of a sudden.  Once the bigshot casting director in New York found out that Ewan is already stateside he requested that the meeting be held at the earliest possible opportunity.  He calls you while you are in rehearsals profusely apologizing and promising to fly back to LA in the next two days right after his meeting is all sorted.  “It’s okay Ewan” you reassure him genuinely understanding. “I will see you when you come back. Good luck I know you’re going to smash it whatever opportunity this is!”  “Thank you darling” he says already wanting to have you back in his arms already mentally kicking himself for not kissing you when he had about a hundred chances to do so. “I’m going to miss you.”  “I’ll miss you too” you respond blushing silly with the phone pressed to your ear. “But it’ll only be two days.”  “Hmm doesn’t matter. I need to take you on our bloody date darling.

Everyone acts like he’s just a random guy who was made king because Viserys supposedly wanted him to be his heir. No even without Viserys’ words he’s the eldest son and that’s why some of the lords sided with him and this war began in general.,2024-07-12 11:42:56 GMT
44,House of the Dragon,['asoiaf'  'a song of ice and fire'  'hotd'  'jacaerys velaryon'  'cregan stark'  'rhaena targaryen'  'baela targaryen'],allovesthings,We are four episodes into this season and i’m still bitter they skipped Jace’s tour of diplomacy around Westeros and Cregan Jace and the pact of ice and fire in particular.  It’s a major character beat for Jace and another way to show how competent and smart he is it’s also a way to see other members of Team Black like Jeyne Arryn and to explicitly point out the misogyny by giving her that quote.  Also Cregan and Jace feels like an incredibly important part of history especially considering the name of the pact both because of politics and magic considering this is the first attempts to marry house Stark and Targaryen/ice and fire.  It was also a way to rectify an error of Game of Thrones by actually having the Manderlys being the Manderlys.  Especially because Jace is kinda just standing around looking angry and baffled by the choices his mother make.   Was the conversation with Baela needed ? Yes   Was the hug between Jace and Rhaenyra extremely good ? Also yes but there was a way all of those could fit.   They could have done this scene after the tour. Jace in the first episode goes to see Jeyne and the Manderlys (it would be 2 scenes instead of the hug and that Cregan/Jace scene at the wall ) episode 2 is Cregan and theirs friendship (and that’s when he learn about Luke’s death because Rhaenyra is in denial in the first episode) he comes back to Dragonstone in episode 3 have the hug and the conversation with Baela while the other drama of team Black is between Rhaena and Rhaenyra which you could have done if you didn’t have the nonsensical scene at the Sept.  Nothing else had to change in the show.  But that would be giving more screentime to the Blacks and we can’t have that.,2024-07-12 11:42:16 GMT
22,House of the Dragon,['daemon x rhaenyra'  'daemyra'  'daemon targaryen'  'rhaenyra targaryen'],midlandslady,So ok let me rant.  I don’t think I can keep watching HOTD. I love the story in itself yes but it is just too painful. First the dragon scenes are excruciating and second I am not loving what they are doing to the story. Rhaenyra is just a goody two shoes I love her I get her not wanting to plunge the realm into chaos that’s all fine and admirable but she has been boring. It’s not Emma’s fault at all but I would love to see Milly’s Rhaenyra with her fierce personality that was so captivating. Younger Rhaenyra was not mean I don’t believe she would have wanted war for the sake of it but she was so compelling that I would still love her plot. And Daemon I cannot. They are destroying Daemon to me. He is my most beloved character more than in the book. I know he’s not good and I don’t want him to be but still I was in love with their romance in season up to ep10 as I don’t remember being in love with a tv show romance in a decade as gothic and twisted as it was. And episode 10 destroyed it for me I can’t stand abusive relationships and that chocking scene was so OOC that I felt betrayed. What had I been watching for the other 9 episodes was it all a lie? Because I am sure I saw a man very deeply in love with a woman a man that became a shadow of himself without her in his life. And all because he had done the right thing. Leaving her in the brothel was not abandoning her it was the right thing to do that’s where I fell in love with their romance honestly. He was overwhelmed by what he was feeling but she was still so young so he spared her from himself from his darkness. Still he went to her wedding to make sure that she was happy with her marriage and you can just see his face when he sees her so radiant dancing with Laenor that he wants her to be happy. So he gives her up. Yet he wanted to hear from her lips that this marriage was what she wanted and so he goes to her and she confirms that she wants it then she challenges him taunts him and he almost loses his mind which was just another reason to let her live her life without him. I was so proud of him. But after episode 10 I read producers saying that Daemon should not be loved by the public because he was evil and the chocking scene was him being what he always was. Bullshit! I realized they were going to do him dirty in season 2 so I almost did not watch it. And I only did because Matt Smith and the producers were saying that Daemon loves Rhaenyra deeply and they are connected kindred spirits and that Daemon would do anything for her and that’s what I wanted to hear for the past 2 years so I relented. His crying when he saw young Rhaenyra with Jaehaerys gave me hope. But then him beheading the version of her he loved the most/ loved him the most? Because he was jealous of his brother? And now him sleeping with Aemma or Alyssa? Like it doesn’t matter who the woman is as long as she is a Targaryen queen? His “curiosity” for Alys? Challenging Rhaenyra’s claim to become king and then she is “welcomed to join him as his (submissive) queen”? What is this? I want to believe Matt’s words I love the Daemon that he describes but that’s not what I am watching right now.,2024-07-12 11:40:46 GMT

REFLECTING ON YOUR JOURNEY IN THE ACTING INDUSTRY DO YOU REMEMBER THE MOMENT YOU REALIZED YOU REALIZED YOU WANTED TO PURSUE ACTING?  “The moment I realized I wanted to pursue acting was probably when I was around 12 years old in high school.” “I was performing in a production of Shakespeare’s Macbeth at the Royal Exchange in Manchester.” “I saw older actors and wondered what their &quot;proper” jobs were outside of the theater.“ ‘When I asked one of them they said’: — &quot;No this is my proper job. This is what I do.” “I didn’t know people could do that.” “From that moment on I knew that this is what I wanted to do as a career.” YOU’VE DONE MULTIPLE SHOWS AND MOVIES IN THE DRAMATIC GENRE. WOULD YOU EVER BE OPEN TO DOING OTHER GENRES?  “Absolutely I’d love to explore new genres in the future.” “I’d love to give comedy a go.” “I think that would be a good challenge.” “It’s difficult because timing is crucial delivering a joke at the right time can feel almost mathematical.” “But I think that good comedy actors don’t see it that way at all.” “It just comes naturally to them.” “I’d love to give it a shot.” “I’m also interested in doing biopics bringing real-life stories to life.” “Chet Baker and Gene Kelly in particular would be fascinating characters to portray.” “But I’m open to any interesting projects that come my way.” HOW DO YOU CHOOSE THE ROLES YOU TAKE ON? ARE YOU DRAWN TO A PARTICULAR TYPE OF CHARACTER OR STORY?  “Honestly I’m drawn to anything that makes me feel uncomfortable and pushes me out of my comfort zone.” “I seek out roles where the character feels distant and challenging.” “I like to test myself and see if I can bring such characters to life.” “If a role feels like something I might struggle with that’s exactly what I want to tackle.” “I often joke that these challenging roles might be my downfall someday.” laughs CAN YOU SHARE ANY INSIGHTS INTO HOW YOUR CHARACTER AEGON II TARGARYEN ENVOLVES IN THE UPCOMING SEASON?  “I found it fascinating to delve deeper into Aegon this season because there’s so much more to uncover about him.” “In the first season we saw quite a two-dimensional view of Aegon—not due to Ty Tennant’s portrayal which I thought was fantastic bringing a lot of vulnerability and teenage angst to the character.” “When I took over the time frame was too short to really explore Aegon’s complexities.” “This time I’ve had an extended period to sit with the character and dig into his deeper layers.” “Playing a character experiencing profound grief is always a challenge.” “I’m lucky enough that I’ve never gone through anything like that myself so I had to imagine it as vividly as possible.” “This season Aegon is shown as more of an empath than a psychopath.” “It becomes clear that he has the capacity to love feel and grieve.” “There are so many comparisons between Aegon and Richard II.” “People are saying Aegon is cold calculated and evil and while he’s certainly done horrible things—I’m not justifying any of those—it’s important to note that rather than being a straightforward villain he’s a crumbling tragedy.” HOW HAS YOUR APPROACH TO PORTRAYING AEGON II CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS SEASON TO THE NEW ONE?  “There’s definitely a continuation of the drama and theatricality from season one.” “It’s huge rousing and intense.” “I’ve seen episodes one to four and they are just unbelievable especially the battle scenes — you can’t get any bigger than that.” “This season though there’s also an element of humor.” “At some point they called Aegon &#x27;the Magnanimous’ and it was important to bring some levity to his character.” “Aegon has just stepped into the role of King and is trying to figure it all out.” “We’re at a point where he’s found a spring in his step enjoying this new responsibility and purpose.” “He’s also got a lot of power now.” “Power can go to people’s heads and make them crazy.” “It was nice to explore his boyishness and playfulness as it gives his character more depth and leaves room for growth.” WHAT WOULD YOU TELL PEOPLE TO GET THEM ON TEAM GREEN?  “I don’t think I need to persuade them—obviously we’re the best.” “But if you really want to see why this season is packed with surprises that will make it clear.” SINCE THE SHOW IS BASED ORIGINALLY ON BOOKS IS THERE A SPECIFIC BOOK YOU’D LIKE TO SEE BROUGHT TO THE SCREEN AND FOR YOU TO BE A PART OF?  “I’d love to see a film adaptation of Douglas Stuart’s book Shuggie Bain.” “Another great choice would be The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet by David Mitchell.” “It’s a collection of beautiful and heart-wrenching short stories and each one could make a compelling film.” “Looking at my bookshelf now I see a lot of books on Bob Dylan David Bowie and Paul McCartney—mostly singer-songwriters.” “I also have a lot of poetry. I’d love to see a biopic of Patti Smith.” “That would be incredible.” YOUR CAREER HAS TAKEN YOU TO VARIOUS FILMING LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. IS THERE A SPECIFIC LOCATION YOU HAVEN’T BEEN TO YET AND WOULD LOVE TO BE THE BACKDROP FOR A POTENTIAL FUTURE PROYECT?  “Oh that’s a good question.” “I think somewhere that’s a hybrid between beautiful rolling countryside and the coast.” “A place that offers both stunning landscapes and the sea.” “On your days off you could go for a swim or hike through the mountains.” “I’d love to work in a scenic and peaceful location like that.” SOMETIMES ACTORS WHO PLAY &#x27;VILLAINS’ CAN GET AN ADVERSE REACTION FROM SOME FANS OF A SHOW. WHAT HAVE YOUR INTERACTIONS BEEN LIKE?  “I’ve been very lucky.” “Many people have approached me with kind words about my portrayal of Aegon.” “It’s a challenging task to humanize someone so seemingly poisonous.” “Fortunately I haven’t had negative encounters with fans who can’t differentiate between the character and the actor.” “I think we’re in a different phase in society now.” “When Jack Gleeson played Joffrey there was less social media presence making it harder for audiences to separate the actor from the character.” “Today I think we are a more technologically advanced community with more behind-the-scenes and a better understanding of the distinction between actor and character.” “I think people have copped on. I hope that’s the case anyway.” YOU’VE COLLABORATED WITH RENOWNED DIRECTORS LIKE CHRISTOPHER NOLAN. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM THESE EXPERIENCES?  “Doing Dunkirk was my first significant experience on a film set.” “I really didn’t know where to start.” “The canvas was completely blank.” “And it was just such a gift a pinch me moment that I was able to learn from some of if not the best filmmaker in the world.” “It was overwhelming.” “And I had to remind myself to be present and soak in everything like a sponge.” “Chris’s patience and the support from the rest of the cast were invaluable throughout.” “We were all in it together especially us young lads who were new to such a big production.” “We learned and grew together during that incredible experience.” IN THE KING YOU PORTRAYED A HISTORICAL FIGURE. HOW DID YOU APPROACH BRINGING THIS CHARACTER TO LIFE?  “When portraying a fictional character there’s often more freedom because there’s no definitive blueprint to follow—even if they’re written in a book they’re still fictional.” “You can infuse your own understanding and personality into the role.” “However there’s added pressure when it comes to a historical figure because you’re portraying someone real.” “I never let that pressure overwhelm or hinder the process.” “Instead I took the character as presented and focused on doing my best with the role.” A NEW HUNGER GAMES MOVIE WAS JUST ANNOUNCED SPECIFICALLY A PREQUEL FOCUSING ON HAYMITCH’S STORY AND MANY FANS ARE EAGER TO SEE YOU IN THAT ROLE. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?  “No way that’s the first I’ve heard of it! But I’m incredibly flattered that people would like to see me on screen again.” “If all goes well I’ll fight for my life in the Hunger Games!” laugh WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE SHOWS DURING YOUR DOWNTIME?  “One show I watch repeatedly and it never gets old for me is the UK version of The Office.” “The humor is very relatable and comforting to me.” “I even laugh just thinking about it. It’s one of those TV shows when it finishes you’re like: — “Oh no! What do I do with my life? I miss the characters already.” laugh &quot;I also enjoy the US version of The Office.” “Besides that I’m fascinated by farming documentaries.” “Shows like This Farming Life on BBC are incredibly calming for me.” “And I have to mention The Great Pottery Throwdown — I’m a bit of a pottery nerd and that show is brilliant! WHO ARE SOME CREATIVES YOU WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH IN THE FUTURE?  &quot;The list is long.” “Firstly there are directors I’d love to collaborate with again like Chris Nolan and Sam Mendes with whom I’ve had some of my best experiences and whom I consider friends.” “I’m eager to work with them again.” “Then there are filmmakers like Andrea Arnold Yorgos Lanthimos Greta Gerwig Paul Thomas Anderson and Ruben Ostlund all of whom I admire and would love to collaborate with.” “When it comes to actors there are many I admire as well.” “I plan to work with individuals who challenge me from whom I can learn and who are dedicated to their craft.” “I appreciate those who find joy and humor in their work because life is short and it’s important to enjoy what you do.” LASTLY WHERE DO YOU HOPE YOUR CAREER WILL HEAD INTO THE FUTURE?  “It’s more of a feeling than a checklist of achievements that I aim for.” “I understand that feeling because I can almost sense it in advance.” “It’s difficult to articulate—it’s a mix of happiness creative fulfillment diversity in roles consistent challenge and pushing boundaries.” “I aspire to transform and lose myself in characters.” “Equally important to me is collaborating with inspiring individuals whom I can learn from and grow with.” “I also value the freedom to select projects that resonate with me personally.”,2024-07-12 10:38:34 GMT

It was taking everything in you not to cry. While a frantic meeting was taking place in the small council chamber you couldn’t pull your eyes off of Jacaerys. He looks so lost. He was sitting at the far end of the table himself holding on tightly to your daughter’s toy.  He was afraid of losing her.  One of the Queen’s kingsguards had come with the news that Sunfyre had broken free out of the dragonpit. The bond between dragon and rider was strong and Sunfyre would most definitely be reunited with his rider on Dragonstone by now. Without taring your eyes away from your broken-looking husband you blurt out “I have a suggestion.”  All eyes turn to you including your mother’s fearful ones. You swallow thickly and Daemon nods for you to continue. “Go on.”  “It doesn’t matter how many knights you send to Dragonstone; Sunfyre will burn them all before they ever step foot on land. The only way to win this battle is to send the dragons to war—“  “No.”  “Your grace—”  “I said no.” Your mother’s voice is sharp. “When dragons fly to war everything burns. I have already lost three children; I will not lose anymore.”  You want to argue for her to hear you out but not wanting to disrespect your mother you bite your tongue. If this were a private conversation you’d happily argue your point but not in front of a council full of men. You hold her gaze from across the table silently letting her know you weren’t backing down.  The corner of her lips pulls into a smile. “Clear the room.”  When the council members start to leave you lower your head slightly and your sight fixates on the shadow of the Seven-Pointed Star which is the most prominent symbol of the faith the Hightowers replaced the Targaryen symbols with. Once the dust has settled you’ll need to speak to someone about having it destroyed and replaced with a three-headed dragon. The seven-pointed star no longer resembled the faith; it was a mockery of how blinded King Viserys was that he allowed his castle to be turned into theirs.  Hearing someone clicking their fingers you look up again and see Daemon taking the jug of wine from the cupbearer before he leaves the room. Silently he pours a cup for your mother Baela and Rhaena but not himself you or Jacaerys. He notices you staring and chuckles. “I reckon we will need a clear head for whatever you have planned.”  “Aegon wants us to know he’s at Dragonstone hoping one of us will attack. I say we do just that. If—”  Leaning back with a huff Daemon says “You want to give the enemy what he wants? That’s your great plan?”  The tone of his voice irks you; he had no faith in the plan you had yet to fully explain. “Yes set a trap of our own.”  Your husband finally speaks and even with rage building inside him Jace’s eyes soften when he looks at you. “We mustn’t forget that Sunfyre is one of the dragons that killed Meleys.”  “I haven’t forgotten what they did to Meleys or our grandmother” you swallow hard. “Which is why I can’t do it alone. I will fly to Dragonstone and taunt Aegon into chasing me on Sunfyre while the second rider is high enough that he won’t see them coming. It will take two of us to end this and prevent further bloodshed.”  The room falls silent and nobody speaks for a beat. Jacaerys clears his throat. “Vermax is smaller and quicker than Viserion; I will go and lure Aegon out. Besides it’s me he sent the raven to; Aegon might suspect a trap if a different dragon goes.”  “I will join you in the sky princess” Baela says. “Our three dragons may be smaller than Sunfyre but with three against one the odds are in our favor.”  “Both Syrax and Caraxes are bigger than—”  “Mother no! You cannot go.”  “What would you have me do Lyarra? Hide in my castle while my children go into battle? Do not ask me to cower here while you risk your life.”  “Your grace at least one dragon rider should remain in the keep. If you all go it might give any green supports that are hiding in the shadows a chance to attack” Rhaena says before looking at Daemon. “You should go as well father; Caraxes is the only dragon with real experience in battle. And the greens may have ships with ballistas among them as they did here in King’s Landing.”  He smiles proudly then nods. “We should prepare ourselves for battle then. It’s important we fly while it’s still daylight.”  —  Jacaerys watches as one of your handmaidens makes sure your braids are tight enough that none of your hair falls into your face. Unlike your husband and stepfather neither you nor Baela had armour and with very little time to prepare it was a scramble to find the two breastplates which were much heavier than you anticipated. The weight pressing down on your shoulders was borderline painful.  In the reflection of your vanity you notice Jace bouncing his knee quickly and that his neck is becoming red. “Are you okay my prince?”  He lets out a small sigh. “I need a moment alone to speak with the princess.”  The sight of his glossy eyes made you want to hold him and promise everything would be okay but you couldn’t. When the room is empty he comes over to you and cups the side of your face. “If things don’t go the way we want a sacrifice may need to be made. The thought of you flying beside me in battle terrifies me but the thought of our children growing up without you is unbearable. I’m only saying this because I need you to know how much I love you Lyarra.”  “I’ll never leave you Jace. Not on the ground and not in the sky.”  His voice cracks: “It’s my fault Luke died and I won’t allow you to die like him.”  “Dying won’t bring him back” you say pushing at his chest slightly. “The absence of you in my life would kill me. Iksā se jorrāelagon hen ñuha ābrar.”  Jacaerys pulls you into his embrace and mumbles how much he loves you multiple times. Looking up you press a gentle kiss to his lips. “I just need to do something first then I’ll meet you in the courtyard.”  —  “Rhaena.”  “Lyarra” she says placing a purple dragon egg into the small black brazier. “I’m just waiting on Baela.”  “I know; I was just wondering if I may have a word in private.”  She looks concerned at you and sits on one of her chairs motioning for you to join her. “What is it you want to discuss? I can only imagine how urgent it must be.”  “I definitely don’t have time management skills” you say lightheartedly. “I’ve come to you because you’re one of the most kindhearted people I know. If the worst happens and me and Jacaerys don’t return can you make sure my children don’t forget how much we love them and Aemma never forgets that Jace thought of her as his own. She needs to remember that.”  “Of course” she says squeezing your hand. “But I believe the gods will be merciful and all four of you will return.”  “There’s one more thing I need to ask of you regarding Princess Jaehaera and Prince Maelor.”  “Oh?”  “Never let them forget how truly special Helaena was. She was so innocent and kindhearted.”  Just like Rhaena.  “I will make sure they remember.”  —  Teary-eyed your mother hugs each of you goodbye in the dragonpit. It hurt to see the fear in her eyes. She had already lost so much for a throne and war she never asked for.  Your younger brother runs towards Jacaerys who is preparing to mount his dragon. “I want to fight with you; I can help you protect our mother.”  You feel emotional watching Jace pick Joffrey up to hug him; he kisses the side of your younger boy’s head and says “You need to stay here and help keep mother safe on the ground along with protecting lAegon and Viserys and the remaining dragons.”  Joffrey was so young and sweet yet all he wanted to do was protect his family. “Oh gods” your mother says wrapping her arm around you. “Be safe my girl.”  “I will return soon my queen and when I do more justice will be served. I love you mother.”  —  It seems the gods were meddling in the war between kin; no man or woman is as accursed as the kinslayer and the gods were doing everything to delay the inevitable. Even though it was still daytime the sun was hidden behind thick dark clouds and the heavy rain and hail that fell from them were obscuring your vision. You could hear the flapping of wings and dragon roars all around you but you’d lost sight of everyone else.  Frightened by a strike of lightning being so close Viserion roars loudly “umbagon gīda Viserion.”  Suddenly you break through the clouds. The rain was still pelting against your skin but you could see clearly now. In the distance Caraxes was burning ships and Moondancer was flying over to join the blood Wyrm but Jace and Vermax were out of sight.  “Dracarys Sunfyre!”  You’re blinded by a blast of Sunfyre’s golden flames and begin to spin in the air when the two dragons latch onto each other. Viserion manages to rake the dragon’s side and wriggle out of its grip.  Hearing a dragon squealing in pain you look towards the ships again and see a pale green figure plummeting towards the sea.  “Baela!”  Aegon takes advantage of your being distracted and blasts you and Viserion in flames again. Thick smoke catches in your throat. Over the sound of your dragon crying in pain and the wind whistling you hear Aegon chuckling to himself. He yells “Once I’m done killing your pup I’m coming back for you!”  When the smoke clears you’re horrified to see Sunfyre’s claws digging into Vermax’s stomach. Jace was ordering his dragon to attack but it’s not until they begin twirling that you notice the tip of Vermax’s tail is gone and bleeding heavily. Viserion bites the golden dragon’s stomach long enough for it to let go of Vermax. The three dragons snap and claw at each other.  Jace screams as loud as he can “Jikagon syt se tīkuni!”  For a split second you locked eyes with Aegon; he was confused. Thankfully his high Valyrian skills were lacking so it gave you and Jacaerys the ability to surprise him with your next move. Both of you momentarily retreat both ordering your dragons in unison to attack in your other tongue. Vermax’s jaws close around Sunfyre’s left wing and Viserion punctures Sunfyre’s right wing with his claws.  “Dracarys!”  You’re blasted in flames for a third time except now that you are closer it hits you and Viserion harder. The smell of burning flesh reaches your nostrils before the burning sensation starts in your hand causing you to scream in agony. If this didn’t end soon your precious Viserion would die and the both of you would go down dragging Sunfyre and Aegon with you.  “Jacaerys go!”  He shouts something back high Valyrian but you can’t make it out. Out of the corner of your eye you see something moving quickly before it disappears. Seconds later another dragon crashes into Sunfyre forcing Vermax to let go. Viserion squeals again and starts to lean to the side. You pull your harness strap even tighter.  Syrax clutches Sunfyre’s neck between her jaws and as the golden dragon takes its last breaths you see Aegon pulling the Valyrian steel dagger that once belonged to your grandsire from his belt his murderous gaze in the direction of your mother.  “Dracarys!”  Tears roll down your cheeks hearing Aegon scream. You never wanted this. If only he had fled to Sunfyre instead of  Syrax lets go and both the dragon and rider crash into the waves below.  Everything is a blur of fire and blood before Viserion crashes onto the shore below.  —  Viserion lets out a low grumble when you kneel on the damp sand and stick your arm into the water attempting to clean the burn on your right hand. He could sense your physical pain and emotional distress. Caraxes was the only other dragon you had seen since the dragons stopped fighting. He was headed in the direction of Kings- Landing but you had yet to see Vermax Syrax or Moondancer.  You press your free hand to your forehead and feel a liquid warmer than it should be. Blood. You must have hit your head when you fell unstrapping yourself. The bleeding would explain the pounding in your head. The dampness of your dress makes it feel much heavier so you sit back on your heels. Nightfall was coming quickly and the small folk who witnessed the fight would soon gather on the beaches to see what remained.  Viserion suddenly snarls.  The pale pink flesh of Sunfyre’s wing stuck between your dragon’s claws. You had tried to remove it but Viserion was too tender and snapped whenever you touched it. “I’m sorry; I should never have put you in harm’s way.”  Viserion leans forward and allows you to rub his nose.  —  Holding out your arms tears of happiness fall from your eyes as the midwife places your newborn babe into your arms. She was tiny and perfect. One of the handmaidens comes over with a cloth but you shake your head and smile “I’ll do it.”  Taking the lukewarm cloth you clean your daughter’s face and body making sure to dip the cloth into the bowl of water Clara holds for you so the fabric doesn’t become dry and rough.  “She is a beautiful princess.”  “That she is. Can you send for prince Jacaerys?”  “Right away princess.”  Jacaerys had waited in the room with you but with Aemma fussing and screaming because she couldn’t understand why she wasn’t allowed in you told Jace to go and comfort her. The babe scrunches her face up and you unlace the top of your nightgown with one hand and pull it down. You place the babe against your bare chest and she finds your breast and starts feeding.  When the door opens you’re greeted by Jace who looks completely mesmerized and Aemma who is holding his hand and trying to stand high enough to see over the bed. He picks her up and asks &quot;are we going to meet your new sibling?”  She nods excitedly.  “It’s a girl.”  “A girl” he repeats tears brimming in his eyes. “Let’s go meet your little sister Aemma.” When they reach the bed he kisses the side of her head and then places her on the bed. “Remember to be gentle with your mummy and the babe.”  Since you were in the middle of the bed Aemma cuddled up on one side of you and Jacaerys came around and sat on the opposite side. He cups your cheek and says “I’m so proud of you.”  “Do you want to hold her once she’s finished feeding?”  Jace looks confused that you even asked but he knew it wasn’t personal. He knew a few good years of a healthy marriage couldn’t undo all the trauma and neglect you’d suffered at the hands of Aegon; it would just take time. “Of course especially since mother and Luke will be desperate for a cuddle.”  “Kepa what’s the baby’s name?”  Jace smiles softly. “We decided to wait until we knew if it was a boy or girl before picking.”  “I thought of one Rhaenys. Our grandmother has lost so much and has always been so strong… but if you don’t like it—”  “I love it” Jace puts his arm around your shoulder and the warmth you feel radiating from him feels as if it’s healing whatever the greens broke inside you. “My little Reni is another daughter to dote on. She’s perfect; all three of you are.”  “Princess? Princess! Prince Jacaerys I’ve found her!”  When your tired eyes flutter open and you see a figure coming towards you it takes a few seconds for your eyesight to come into focus and you can recognise the person as Ser Erryk. The feeling of warmth you felt while dreaming was Viserion wrapping his wing around you shielding you from the wind and rain as you leaned against his body. Your stubborn dragon had refused to fly back to the dragonpit so you remained by his side.  Viserion roars when the knight approaches and prevents him from getting any closer. You rub at your dragon’s side gently and hum “It’s okay it’s okay.”  “Lyarra! Lyarra!”  Being so familiar with Jace Viserion that he only lets out a low grumble when he approaches slowly he knew not to startle a wounded dragon. You get to your feet and sway slightly. “Jace my love you’re safe.”  “I thought I’d lost you. Ser Erryk inform the queen princess Lyarra has been found. I’m taking her to a carriage; she needs to see a maester right away.”  —  When you feel something brushing across your forehead you automatically raise your hand and snatch it. When your eyes open you immediately let go. “Forgive me Elinda. I…” You take in your surroundings; in the confusion of waking up you’d forgotten you’d returned to the red keep the night before. “I was unsure of where I was.”  She gives you a sympathetic look and speaks in a hushed voice “It’s okay princess; you’ve been through a lot. I was attempting to wipe the dried blood off your head without waking you.”  “Where is my mother?”  “Her grace is watching over the young prince’s in the queen’s quarters. Would you like me to tell her you’re awake?”  “Yes thank you.”  With Elinda no longer standing in front of you you see Jace sleeping in one of the chairs facing the bed. His face was covered in cuts and bruises but he didn’t appear to have any serious injuries. Swinging your legs out of bed you put pressure on your burned hand and whine waking him.  “Lyarra.” Jace rushes over to you and presses his lips against yours. “I’m so sorry I could pro—”  “Don’t I don’t want to hear it; you are the reason I’m still here” you say softly. “We are all alive and that’s all that matters. How is Baela?”  “Heartbroken the dragon keepers on Dragonstone don’t think Moondancer will recover from her injuries. I’m just thankful Baela was able to jump into the water before hitting the ground.”  A crossbow pierced Moondancer’s wing causing the dragon and rider to fall from the sky. The men on the ships started firing at Baela when she tried to swim ashore but Daemon burned them all. “And you? Your eye has swollen since last night.”  “It doesn’t hurt and I’m more concerned about you.” He looks down at your hand which is now wrapped in white bandages. “Sunfyre came out of nowhere and Vermax flew down low to escape him after his tail was bitten. When we came back up the first thing I saw was you being burned.”  “Tis only my hand; besides I needed a war wound. I could not simply be outdone by my husband having a battle scar and I don’t.”  Jace laughs and kisses your forehead then the tip of your nose.  “I can’t believe I told mother to stay thinking I was protecting her and in the end it was her that saved us. Any word on how Viserion is?”  “With the help of Daemon the dragon keeper eventually managed to remove the wings from his claws but they needed to remove one of the nails so Viserion will need plenty of time to rest.”  “And Vermax?”  A smile tugs on his lips. “Even more ill-tempered but they assure me he’ll heal.”  “I’m glad. We ought to send a raven to Cregan expressing our gratitude and letting him know we will be coming for our children.”  “I’ve already sent a raven letting him know the war is over so the Northerners no longer need to march south and I’ve said Clara is to return with our children. The maester said you can’t travel with stitches on your head.”  Resting your forehead against his chest you mumble and tears of happiness start to roll down your cheeks knowing your family would be together again soon. “I know we’ve just been through a lot but I need you to do something for me.”  “Anything my love.”  “Sentence Larys Strong to death.”  —  “You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges?”  Standing in the middle of the dragonpit Larys looks unfazed; he simply shrugs. Perhaps he no longer cares since he knows his fate is doomed. A tiny part of you was fearful his death would set something he had prearranged in motion. But he needed to answer for his crimes.  Jace tightens his grip on the hilt of his sword. “In the name of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen first of her name queen of the Andals the Rhoynar and the First Men Lady of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm I hereby sentence you to death on the charges of being a traitor to House Targaryen and for the murder of Lord Lyonel Strong and Ser Harwin Strong.”  Vermax walks out of the shadows of the dragon pit and looms over Larys.  “Dracarys.”  You glance at your mother and see the grief on her face. This wouldn’t bring Harwin back but you hoped the truth being known would help her Jacaerys and Joffrey have closure one day. There had been rumors for years that the clubfoot was involved in the deaths of his own father and brother but it wasn’t until you sentenced Otto to death and saw the look in his Larys eyes that you knew it was true.  —  A small feast was held in honor of the rightful heir finally sitting on the throne with the council members who supported your mother’s claim in attendance but as the hall started to thin out you wanted to go to bed but you didn’t want to ruin Jacaerys night; even if you left alone he would follow you. Glancing in his direction you smiled. Jace was speaking with your grandsire while holding Joffrey who had fallen asleep.  Daemon sits down fills half a cup of wine and pushes it in front of you. “Bloodshed is not an easy thing to digest. You can speak freely with me.”  “I’m glad they died together.”  “You and the queen took two enemies out at once.”  “They say when we die our dragons mourn us but they can bond with another rider. That wouldn’t have happened with Sunfyre.” You take two large gulps of wine finish the cup and wipe the residue off with the back of your hand. “Sailors would sing songs about a dragon with golden scales that glisten in the sunlight that would haunt the shores of Dragonstone; they would claim to still hear its cries while it searched for its rider.”  “The dragons have no control over what side they are on but the usurper was a cunt long before he stole your mother’s throne.”  “I know what he is—was but hearing songs being sung about his death by drunken fools doesn’t feel right. It’s exactly what they did when Lucerys died.”  He strokes your cheek “and one day they will move on and find another death to sing about.”  Daemon kisses the back of your head before going to join your mother who is waving him over. It was the first time in a long time that she seemed genuinely happy.  “Not a fan of the wine princess?”  “No it’s revolting.” Wine was something you never drank unless it was watered down. You smile when Jace sits down beside you; it was only you and him now sitting at the Queen’s high table. “Where has Joffrey gone?”  “Elinda has taken the little prince to his chambers.” He glances around the room and quietly says “It almost feels surreal doesn’t it? Everything that has happened.”  You rub small circles on the back of Jacaerys hand with your thumb. “What do we do now my prince?”  “We wait for our children to come home.”     Iksa se jorrâelagon hen nuha abrar — you are the love of my life  Umbagon gida — stay calm  Jikagon st se tikuni — go for the wings,2024-07-12 14:38:05 GMT

29,House of the Dragon,['anti daemon targaryen'  'criston cole'],abla-soso,I don’t like Cole but it’s very annoying how TB stans try to justify hating him while loving Daemon despite him having the same ugly flaws.  “At least Deamon owns up to who he is and doesn’t act like a self-righteous holier-than-thou hypocrit”  Daemon is a Targaryen supremacist 😭😂  How can anyone be more of a self-righteous holier-than-thou hypocrit than the one who believes “I am closer to godhood than humanity”?   Daemon is not shameless about his evil actions because he’s a super honest person who hates hypocrisy. It’s because he’s a Targaryen supremacist who believes he’s entitled to do these evil actions. Supremacist jerks are the biggest hypocrites out there. “I can do horrible shit to anyone but no one has the right to do any horrible shit to me but I am simply superior”.   He doesn’t “own up to who he is” because he doesn’t even think he’s amoral or a bad person! Just like how white supremacists never considered themselves amoral or bad when they committed atrocities against non-white people.  Hypocrisy born out of a shamed and guilt-ridden consciousness is way more forgivable than an honesty born out of supremacist arrogant and shameless depravity.,2024-07-12 14:31:45 GMT

People need to know this!   According to the ANDAL LAW the succession should be like this in HOTD after Viserys I and this is what Greens wanted in the book  Aegon II — Jaehaerys (rip little prince) — Maelor the Missing — Jaehaera — Aemond — Daeron the Daring — Rhaenyra — Aegon III — Viserys II — Visenya (if she lived) — Helaena (in case everyone above her die) — Daemon — Baela — Rhaena — Rhaenys (if everyone with Targaryen surname die)   Not including Strong Boys because like it or not they are bastards and shouldn’t be in line of inheritance. They could have been if Rhaenyra married Harwin. She didn’t.   Also wanted to specify that ANDAL LAW is better than Valyrian and Northern. Only second to RHOYNISH LAW and Targs in this era hate Dorne. It’s funny if they adapt their laws.   According to the Valyrian Jaehaera Rhaenyra and Helaena will come after Daemon and his sons. (I am saying this after reading the mess of Maegor’s rule and Jaehaerys calling GC 1.)   And this is Alicent House Hightower and majority of Westeros’ religion.   She didn’t sinned or betrayed anyone by having him crowned her son has the right to the Iron Throne. His ascension should not have been a misunderstanding he has the right to the throne and there is a reason history remembers him as the king.,2024-07-12 15:17:43 GMT

Rhaenyra occupying Dragonstone was gathering armies and allies around her. Aegon was doing the same though he was merely a pawn in the hands of those wiser than himself. Nevertheless the Targaryen family was split in two: one side wore black the other green. However it seemed that the Dragon Family had not just split in two but shattered like a broken glass.  One of the dining halls in the Red Keep hosted a silent dinner. Since the king’s death meals had passed in silence. At the head of the table where Viserys once sat now sat Aegon. Next to him was his mother then the Hand of the King. On the new king’s left sat Aemond followed by their two younger sisters. No one exchanged even a glance.  After dinner everyone left the table and went their separate ways but Alicent stopped her older daughter asking her to have a word. The girl nodded and they went to the mother’s chambers.  “Has something happened?” the young princess asked once they were alone. The woman quickly reached for a jug of wine and filled her goblet taking several large sips. The alcohol however did not ease the knot in her throat. Alicent clutched the goblet in her hand and sat down looking at her daughter. She stared at her for a few moments in silence as if trying to memorize as many details of her as possible. If she could she would have imprinted her image on her mind.  “Mother—” “You will go north” Alicent interrupted her declaring it like a crossbow bolt. She knew this revelation would not be easy for her. Accepting the news would be equally difficult for her daughter.  “What?” the girl frowned. “Me? To the North?”  The woman nodded and sighed wanting to gather some courage and convince herself that what she was doing was right.  “You know well that war is coming and even if we wanted to it is inevitable” she returned her gaze to her daughter’s face who was looking at her with a slight frown between her brows. “We need allies and the most are in the North. We must forge an alliance with them.”  “Why are you entrusting me with such task?” she asked shaking her head. “I understand you won’t send Aegon but Aemond? Ser Criston?”  Alicent tightened her grip on the goblet and if it had been made of a weaker material it would have shattered in her hand by now.  “Only you can bring the North closer to us.”  The young princess frowned even more and shook her head. She didn’t understand any of this.  “Am I to go there alone?” she looked back at her mother who only nodded. “How long am I to be there?”  “You will marry Cregan Stark” she announced placing the goblet on her lap. “There is no stronger alliance than marriage. Rhaenyra can do nothing about it.”  The girl scoffed in disbelief and took a few steps back.  “This is absurd utter madness” she believed her mother was joking but the woman’s face still had the same expression. “But you promised me to Aegon!”  “Aegon broke off the engagement” she said looking at her daughter’s face. “He knows it is necessary.”  The young princess laughed bitterly and tears hot as molten steel streamed down her cheeks.  “The North will not stand with a usurper you know that very well!”  “Lord Stark is extremely pleased with the prospect of marrying a Targaryen and eagerly awaits you” she said almost mechanically. She had been repeating this sentence nonstop for days as if trying to convince herself that what is she doing was right. However she couldn’t bear to look at her daughter’s tear-streaked bitter face.  “You’re a monster” she sobbed turning and grabbing the door handle.  “We all must sacrifice for the greater good” she said but her daughter no longer heard her.  The shaken princess hurriedly left the castle heading to the Dragonpit. She sobbed bitterly tears streaming down her cheeks. When she heard Vermithor she quickened her pace running. When she saw the dragon her heart momentarily lifted. It broke however when she saw the massive collar around the beast’s neck and the heavy chain that bound it. She cried out reaching out and touching the dragon’s snout.  “What have they done to you?”  The bronze giant looked weakened likely given a massive dose of something to sedate him during the collaring. The young princess couldn’t believe what her own family was capable of.  “There it’s alright” she ran her hands over his snout though she herself was shattered into pieces. Sadness grief and despair mixed with fury. She walked around the dragon and stood before the collar clasp grabbing the chain and pulling with all her strength. But even with that it didn’t budge.  The girl screamed in anger her scream not sounding like that of a teenager. It sounded like the roar of an enraged dragon yet even the beast’s roar couldn’t break the brass chains.  “I’m so sorry” the girl sobbed helplessly kneeling by the beast’s snout and hugging it with all her might. “I’m sorry.”  The young princess did not return to the castle. She spent the night in the Dragonpit nestled against the side of her dragon. She cried until sleep overcame her. Vermithor covered her with his wing.  The next morning when the Dragonkeepers were ordered to bring the princess the dragon roared fiercely not allowing them to approach. The girl woke immediately.  “Princess” one of the men spoke standing at a distance the dragon permitted. “The queen summons you to the castle.”  “She is not the queen” the princess muttered sniffing. She stood and wiped her face with her hands. She felt tears welling up under her eyelids again. Vermithor sensed her emotions and abandoned his aggressive stance laying his snout flat on the ground. The girl smiled sadly and hugged the dragon one last time.  “Geros ilas uēpa raqiros” she said raising her head and looking at the bronze giant. She tenderly stroked his scales. Bitter tears once again wetted her cheeks but she wiped them away with a clenched fist. “Nyke jāhor māzigon arlī skori issa jēda māzigon se hēnkirī īlon jāhor zālagon ry lī qilōni gōntan bisa naejot īlva.” (Farewell old friend. I will return when my time comes and together we will burn all those who did this to us.)  She walked away not looking back. She heard the dragon’s roar and cry the clanking of chains and the flapping of wings. But she left the Dragonpit alone.  At the castle gates two carriages and about four dozen knights waited all on horses and in shining armor. Alicent waited by one carriage accompanied by the Hand of the King. Ser Criston also looked like he was being sent on a journey probably to make sure than the princess will not run away. However neither Aegon Aemond nor Helaena were among the crowd. The girl felt like spitting in her mother’s and the Hand’s faces. She could only guess that her siblings knew nothing about this. No one could convince her that Aegon had agreed to break the engagement. He might be foolish and reckless but he loved his sister sincerely. And Helaena? She would never have let her go.  Alicent wanted to say something reached out to her daughter but the girl didn’t even look at her. She got into the carriage and slammed the door. She would return and burn them all.  For several days until the first stop the young princess didn’t say a word to anyone. She didn’t eat or drink much which did not go unnoticed by several of her maids who had been sent with her. Fearing the princess planned to starve herself to death they tried to persuade her to eat at least small amounts. Sometimes they succeeded sometimes not.  As a result the girl lost a lot of weight during the journey. Her dresses became too large her eyes sunken and her hair once like glowing gold now resembled spider silk. The princess stopped spending the journey in tears only when the entourage passed Harrenhal. She remained silent and the feasts thrown by the lords to host her were always the first she left apologizing and explaining a headache. No one blamed her.  As the entourage moved further the days grew shorter and the nights colder. Winterfell was near but the approaching winter was even nearer.  The Targaryen princess reached the northern capital after over two moons.  At the maid’s suggestion the girl donned a thick fur coat and as soon as she stepped outside her carriage she was greeted by piercing cold. She had seen snow on the journey but there was much more of it here and it still fell from the sky. Lead-colored clouds hung low and snowflakes swirled in the wind falling onto the icy ground. They also fell on her snow-like hair which the frosty wind blew kissing her cheeks in greeting.  Cregan Stark the young lord of Winterfell and her future husband also came to greet her.  The young man was the textbook definition of a Northerner. He was only a little older than her but his sharp features made him appear more mature than he actually was. The Wolf of the North was over a head taller than her with broad shoulders and a well-built physique now covered under a thick fur. The wind tousled his shoulder-length brown hair and his toughened skin was impervious to the cold. Not like the girl’s cheeks now rosy as petals of a fresh bloomed flower.  “Princess” he spoke his voice deep and marked by an accent. “I welcome you to Winterfell.”  “My Lord” she forced a smile though she knew it must have looked more like a grimace. The Dragon Princess was aware that she would have to endure many more forced smiles and artificial courtesies.  The Wolf of the North however did not require any courtesy from her. He knew why the girl had been sent to him and what was expected of her; he had even heard rumors of a broken engagement. He decided not to pressure her and let her get used to the new place to the North. After all a Dragon had ended up among a pack of Wolves.  The wedding did not wait for the girl to get accustomed to Winterfell; it took place just a few days after her arrival at the Stark stronghold. The Dragon Princess had exchanged only a few formal sentences with the Lord of the North before she had to call him husband. The Godswood where the wedding was held had seen many a forced marriage. The girl had even come to terms with the bedding but the Young Wolf announced that it would not take place.  “Perhaps one day a spark of affection will ignite within you and you will come to my arms of your own accord” he said when he saw the questioning look on her face.  The night after the wedding the marriage was spent apart. Every subsequent night was as well.  Days passed and the young princess gradually came to terms with her new reality. She knew this was her life now that she was the wife of the Wolf of the North and the Lady of Winterfell. The choice she had been forced into might not have pleased her but it did not mean it was a bad one.  After some time the girl began to spend more time outside her chambers. She abandoned reading and took up sewing helping the servants mend linens and clothes. She insisted on mending her husband’s clothes herself asking that no one else do it for her. Although it was not her duty every morning and evening she fed the animals. The young princess missed her dragon dearly but she found joy in spending time with horses feeding chickens or petting rabbits.  One of the servants once ran terrified to inform Cregan that the princess was endangering herself with the direwolves. The Lord worried quickly went with her to the scene only to find there was no reason for concern. The girl sat motionless on the ground allowing the animals to sniff her. Two wolves wagged their tails and one even lay down beside her. Cregan’s heart swelled at the sight not because of her interaction with the animals but because for the first time he saw a smile on her face. He could have sworn it was genuine.  The marriage however still did not see them spending much time together nor talking much. This did not mean the Young Wolf was not interested in his wife; quite the opposite. Both morning and evening he would ask the servants how the girl was doing. After some time the young princess began to do the same.  “What is he like?” she asked one day while she and two Winterfell servants were mending clothes. Though she did not ask directly the women knew she meant Lord Stark. They exchanged glances and only smiled. Did her question mean that the Dragon Princess was beginning to warm to the Wolf Lord?  “He has a very big heart my lady” one admitted. “At first glance he may seem intimidating but he is a gentle giant. Lord Stark is very kind.”  The girl lowered her gaze focusing on her work. She smiled slightly.  “I think he is a good man too” she admitted.  “That does not mean he can be trifled with” added the other. “He is kind when someone gives him the same. But he is a wolf my lady. He can bite if provoked.”  Indeed Cregan appeared to be a man of steel nerves who could turn that steel into a sword with which he could take a life without a second thought.  When the princess had finished her duties she dressed and went outside to spend some time in the stables. In the courtyard a few men were preparing for a journey saddling horses. Among them was her husband.  “My lady” he smiled at the sight of her. Each of the men bowed slightly.  “Are you going somewhere my lord?” she asked stroking his horse’s muzzle.  “Hunting” he announced fastening a crossbow to the saddle. “I will return before nightfall.”  “Could I accompany you?” she asked without much thought. The young man’s lips twitched upward. The unexpected proposal pleased him.  “You would do me a great honor my lady.”  And so the Wolf and the Dragon set off together side by side. They rode at the front accompanied by four men. No one questioned the princess’s participation.  When they reached the depths of the forest they tied the horses to a tree and continued on foot. At a certain point they all split up but the Wolf and the Dragon stayed together. They were silent but it was not an awkward silence. Their mutual company was enough.  “Look” he leaned toward her whispering. “There between the trees. Beyond the fallen trunk.”  The girl quickly found the point he indicated and smiled at the sight of a deer. The stag was large and its antlers were even larger. It calmly stripped moss from the fallen tree.  Cregan silently removed the crossbow from his shoulder. The girl felt a pang in her heart. Of course she thought. They hadn’t come for a stroll.  The Young Wolf noticed her troubled expression. He knew what saddened her.  “I never let them suffer longer than necessary” he assured. The girl quickly nodded causing a tear to roll down her cheek. She quickly wiped it away with her hand.  Cregan drew the arrow and raised the crossbow aiming at the deer. A moment of silence a whoosh of air and a dull thud. The stag fell to the ground. The young man glanced at his wife’s face one last time and moved ahead. When they reached the deer it was already dead. Blood flowed from its mouth and the once-living body was now motionless. Cregan approached to retrieve the arrow but the girl beat him to it. She knelt by the dead animal and gently ran her hand along its neck stroking it soft golden fur. For a moment she gazed at the deer absorbing its beauty. Tears welled up in her eyes again so she quickly grabbed the arrow pulled it out and stood up handing it to her husband. Cregan took it in silence.  Although neither of them spoke for the rest of the hunt an understanding formed between them a sort of alliance. The culture and customs of the North were so wild and distant for someone from the South. The young princess however knew that Winterfell was her home now. And if it was her home she had to learn its customs. Even if they were far from her own beliefs.  That evening despite the darkness the Wolf Lord could have sworn that the scales of the Southern Dragon glistened with a snowy sheen.  A few days after the first closer interaction between the young marriage Cregan decided he would like to spend some time with the girl again. He knocked on her chamber door and when she let him in he entered. The girl was sitting by the fireplace stuffing pillows with feathers but she smiled at the sight of her husband.  “My lady” he nodded to her lightly returning her smile.  “My lord” she replied reaching for a needle and beginning to sew the pillow. “Something brings you here?” she asked after a moment when he silently observed her deftly working fingers.  “I would like to introduce someone to you” he replied causing the girl to frown slightly in surprise.  “Do we have guests?”  The young man nodded and reached for her fur. Seeing his gesture encouraging her to stop working she set her task aside and stood up. She walked over to him and turned allowing him to help her dress. Shortly afterward they went outside.  “Who are these guests? Did we know they were coming?” she asked glancing at her husband.  “We expected them but we didn’t know when they would arrive” he explained.  They passed the courtyard which was empty. There was no sign that Winterfell had visitors. The girl remained silent until they entered one of the sheds. This particular one housed the direwolves. She was about to ask what this was all about when she heard squeaks and whimpers. As she connected the dots the frown disappeared from her brow and her violet eyes lit up.  “No way it can’t be.”  Cregan smiled and gestured for her to come closer. Around the corner on a bed of straw lay a she-wolf. Four pups were latched onto her teats and one of them with nearly golden fur was sleeping a bit further away.  The young princess was genuinely moved by the sight. Cregan smiled as well not just because of the litter but because of his wife’s joy.  “They were born this morning” he announced. “Four females and a male.”  The male turned out to be the pup lying away from the pack. He was bigger than the rest and had a bronze coat a color familiar to the girl. When the little wolf woke up and stretched Cregan approached and petted the she-wolf’s head silently praising her for a job well done. He picked up the pup that was away from the mother and held him in his arms then handed him to the girl. The young princess cradled him stroking him gently.  “So you’ve returned to me as a direwolf” she said softly more to herself than to her husband.  Cregan looked at his wife questioningly. The young princess felt his gaze on her.  “My dragon has a very similar color” she explained scratching the wolf pup behind the ear. “They call him the Bronze Fury all because of the color of his scales.”  “In the skies is he truly a fury?” he asked watching her interaction with the pup.  The girl laughed softly and shook her head. “Maybe once when my great-grandfather rode him. Now he’s an old beast. Sometimes I felt he preferred a nap over a ride with me.”  Cregan smiled at her words. He noticed that she found joy in animals especially direwolves and dragons. While he couldn’t provide the latter he was glad he could bring her happiness with the pups.  “He’s yours now” he declared when she kissed the pup between the ears. “The Targaryens have dragons the Starks have direwolves. It’s time for you to have your own.”  The girl looked again at the pup she was holding and smiled even more. Her heart swelled with emotion.  “Thank you” she said looking at her husband. Cregan returned her smile.  “What will you name him?”  “Vermithor” she said without hesitation. “I feel he’s a dragon in a direwolf’s body.”  To the servants’ concern they spent several hours in the shed out of sight of everyone. They sat on the straw among the pups talking about dragons direwolves flights in the clouds and hunts in the forests. For the first time since they met and got married they had the chance to learn something about each other.  “I’ve never seen a dragon” Cregan admitted. His sword lay by his straightened legs and he leaned his back against the rough wall.  “I wish you to never have to” the girl replied. Her legs were crossed and in them like in a nest slept little Vermithor. “Dragons never bode well.”  “But still they obey you” he looked at her. “How do you manage that?”  “You can’t control them completely; they are still wild beasts” she noted. “But the Targaryens have managed to do so to some extent for thousands of years back when the home of dragons was Valyria.”  “Dragons respond only to the old language right?” The young princess nodded in confirmation. “Just as I’ve never seen a dragon I’ve never encountered that language.”  “Zyr sindighy iderēbion kes as qogralbar” she said and the Young Wolf smiled. “Se valzi rijinyso sizi vys̄oron” (It is a very rough language in my opinion. And also not the easiest to learn)  “If I were a dragon and heard something like that I wouldn’t hesitate to follow orders” he replied making her laugh. Cregan also smiled sincerely. He never thought he’d hear the language of Old Valyria but even more he didn’t expect to hear such sincere laughter of the Dragon Princess.  Winter began to settle more and more into Winterfell but the biting cold was defied by the spark of affection that blossomed between the Wolf and the Dragon.,2024-07-12 16:53:13 GMT

They are relatively intelligent but they are still beasts.  They bond with men… some men… and the why and how of that and how it came to be will eventually be revealed in more detail in THE WINDS OF WINTER and A DREAM OF SPRING and some in BLOOD &amp; FIRE. (Septon Barth got much of it right). Like wolves and bears and lions dragons can be trained but never entirely tamed. They will always be dangerous. Some are wilder and more wilful than others. They are individuals they have personalities… and they often reflect the personalities of their riders thanks to bond they share are.

Unless maybe their rider was obsessed with the shiny stuff and even then…   …   My dragons are predators carnivores who like their meat will done.

And when the girl gave herself into her mother’s arms the news reached her that Princess Rhaenyra had given birth to a prince… The two babies were born minutes apart with Jacaerys Velaryon being the eldest of the two. A boy with brown hair and brown eyes a bastard in the eyes of the green queen. Instead Alicent’s newborn daughter was an embodiment of Valyrian traits in person her scarce hair was as pale as snow and the first glow the queen saw in Deianira’s eyes was amethyst.  King Viserys took the news of the Parthians as a divine sign sent by the gods and perhaps it was… The man Targaryen went to his firstborn’s quarters to meet the future heir…leaving his wife and daughter alone for most of the day. When King Viserys finally approached his queen he found a sleeping Alicent hugging the baby. But he dared not do anything to wake them up. The next day the man ordered the newborn children to share a wet nurse in order to strengthen their bond and try to repair the growing rift that separated their family. He also offered a deal to the princes’ mothers a betrothal between the two children…so Deianira would be the queen consort and Jacaerys the king when his time came to rule.  Princess Rhaenyra was more than delighted with the idea but Alicent refused the offer unable to even imagine her little daughter in the hands of a bastard. And so the years passed in the red keep… The Green Queen’s hatred for her stepdaughter and ex best friend became as ardent as the flames of a dragon and whenever her youngest daughter was belittled by the presence of Prince Jacaerys her tolerance for the bastards diminished. Rhaenyra’s dishonorable continuation of childbearing did not improve the situation. Alicent spent her afternoons talking to her children warning them about her half-sister and her bastard children especially to her eldest child Aegon.  In this way Deianira cultivated a resentment towards her nephew Jacaerys. Who stole all the attention of her father there were even several onomastics where the king forgot his youngest daughter… Without remembering many times that both children were born the same day. But the worst of all those days was the morning when Jace and Nira turned six onomastics old. King Viserys as every year had made a feast for the future king…but on that occasion he had not even noticed to congratulate his daughter as well. Deianira watched as her father spent the afternoon playing with the boy and sitting on the throne put Jacaerys on his legs. Proclaiming that that would be his seat when he grew up and that that day was cause for celebration because he was with them.  After that the relationship between father and daughter only deteriorated Nira was fed by anger towards her father for months and months which led her to develop rebellious and violent attitudes. The last straw for the king was when during an argument at dinner Deianira threw a fork into Jacaerys’ face. Stabbing the tips of the utensil in the forehead and leaving a small scar on his skin. Viserys tried to talk to his youngest daughter but Princess Rhaenyra told him that she should be severely punished for her behavior towards the future king which caused a dispute between both mothers…each trying to defend their respective children.  The fight did not stop until Ser Criston interfered suggesting to the king that the princess could improve her behavior and calm her anger through disciplined training practicing alongside her older brothers Aegon and Aemond. A proposal that the king thought carefully and ended up accepting. In this way the life of the white haired princess changed completely she spent every morning training with her nephews and brothers her afternoons doing recreational activities with her sister Helaena and her nights reading or learning High Valyrian next to Aemond. Both children were very close so much so that Alicent thought about brethroting them…but she never did it.  That specific morning the youngest girl was with her older brother trying to speak in their father’s language with the dragon keepers the men nodding or denying the questions the princess asked them. It was not until Aegon arrived with their two brown nephews that Deianira’s mood changed.   “Why do these two had to come?” The girl whispered to Aemond who pinched her upon hearing her.  “Be kinder they are our family” he told her and she headed towards Aegon. Nira frowned and approached barely unwilling to do so.  “Good morning Deianira” the youngest child said seeing her aunt walking by her feet the princess nodded.  “Good morning too Lucerys” she says and tries to smile but her grimace gives her away. Then she looks at her eldest brother “Aegon.” she says in the form of a greeting but ignores Jacaerys.  The brown haired boy rolls his eyes when he sees her attitude.   “Jacaerys is also here Nira” murmurs Aemond.  “I know…” she says. And then she does not speak again. Jace is angry to see her behaving so childishly but he does not pay attention.  The princess get into the pit next to the elders and from the bottom of the huge cave comes the dragon Vermax…a green animal with golden almost orange horns. Apparently it was a male dragon because every year it grew abruptly as if it stretched and enlarged when no one was looking. Deianira and Aemond were the only ones without a dragon of their own the prince’s egg had not hatched and the princess’s dragon had perished a few days after birth as it was very weak and small…even it´s wings were thin so thin that if it had survived it would never have been able to fly.  The dragon keepers incited the eldest Velaryon boy to approach their dragon and he went towards the beast somewhat fearful. The animal was unleashed and headed for its future rider.  “Call Vermax Prince Jacaerys” one of the man’s indicated  speaking High Valyrian.  “Attention!” Jace exclaimed but he stepped back as the dragon approached him quickly as if to attack him “Stop Vermax!” Jace said and Vermax obeyed the man beside him smiled faintly.  “Well done” the elder murmured then some caretakers brought a small lamb Deianira opened his eyes as they approached him towards the round.  “Aren’t you going to…?” the girl’s words were interrupted by her older nephew who ordered his beast to stop because the dragon had turned to the innocent animal. Vermax growled but he did as it´s rider told him. “You must keep control over your dragon my young prince” a young dragon keeper translated the words of an elder because the prince´s were not yet so advanced in the language except Aemond and Deianira who understood each word “As Prince Aegon had it with Sunfyre. Once Vermax is attached to you it will refuse to take orders from anyone else” he said. The dragon let out a desperate grunt seeing the pale animal Jace turned to the leader the excitement on his childish face evident from afar.  “May I?” he questioned and received a nod from the brown the brown haired prince turned around to face his uncles and aunt. Aegon had bored looking everywhere but not there Aemond looked with a touch of interest and Deianira had a grimace of disgust. That expression was almost characteristic of the princess. Or at least something Jacaerys always noticed when he was around. And always no matter what the boy wanted to impress her. He still didn’t know why but he wanted her to respect him.   Which always ended up going wrong.  “Dracarys Vermax!” Jace shouted and the dragon spewed fire through it´s mouth burning the lamb alive Nira uttered an almost inaudible exclamation and clung to Aemond’s arm. Not out of fear but out of indignation. Was it difficult to sacrifice the animal before giving it to a dragon? Could they not spare him the suffering of a painful death? Deianira hated cruelty to the innocent especially to animals.  The lamb shrieked in pain as the embers clung to it´s body and the princess forced herself not to look away. Vermax went to the corpse of the animal that was once white and devoured it with a few bites then the dragon keepers took the dragon back to it´s pit leaving the princes alone. Nira tightened the grip she had on her older brother’s arm.  “Aemond Deianira” Aegon called them “We have a surprise for you two” he said and Nira rolled her eyes knowing that nothing good could come from her mother’s firstborn. But she said nothing because she noticed the glow of emotion in Aemond’s eyes.  “What is?” the white haired boy asked. Lucerys said it was something very special with a mocking tone and the girl looked at the boy with annoyance. Thinking how far he’d fly if she kicked him at that precise moment but at seeing him run away she preferred to suppress her desires.  “You two are the only ones who do not have a dragon” Aegon spoke.   “It is your fault you chose the worst eggs for us” Deianira murmurs feeling how her brother took her back and began to move with them at his side.  “True it is your fault” Aemond agrees remembering that their eggs had been chosen by Aegon before their births.  “Well just…shut up” the eldest prince interrupts them feeling attacked “I feel bad about my bad choices okay? Well…we all felt a little bad so we found something for you two” the younger white haired boy frown frowned unable to believe him.  “You…find a dragon seriously?” he asks his tone full of uncertainty.  “You can’t even find your high Valyrian notes how will you find a dragon?” Deianira asks half mocking him and half skeptical.  “The gods provide little sister” Aegon whispers “The gods provide”  Aemond and Deianira watched as Luke approached…next to a pig with a harness made of brown strings and false feathers that pretended to mimic two wings.  “Admire the Pink Dread!” Aegon exclaims bursting with laughter the laughter of the two bastards boys fills the ears of the princes. Aemond feels humiliated his heart sink in his chest while Deianira feels only anger. It’s like a hurricane is about to break loose in her stomach “It has room for two mounts but be careful… the first fly can be difficult”   Nira clenches her fists but does nothing yet. Aegon and Jacaerys begin to make sounds mimicking a pig and the princess feels an immense urge to throw herself on her brother and tear apart the hairs from his head one by one and with the disgusting bastard of her sister…the words could not describe how much she wanted to hurt him. She wanted to see him bleed.  A few minutes later Aemond was still petrified beside Deianira the children were gone and the girl was looking at her brother.  “Now they will know who I am” the princess declares her cheeks red of anger and her jaw clenching she sighs before coming out of the pit as soul being chased by the seven devils Aemond sighs too as she leaves…it was as if a black cloud settled on her head.  “This will end up badly” he whispers giving up then he turns around and makes up his mind starting to creep into the depths of the dragon pit.  Aegon held his nose while it bled in droves. Beside him sat Deianira who had her shoulders down awaiting for her punishment. Jacaerys covered his eye with his hand feeling it begin to swell. Lucerys was the only one who was intact Nira had not been able to jump on him as her hands and feet were busy beating the two elders.  The first to arrive the room was Rhaenyra she looked at Jace stunned and worried.  “Who did this?!” she asked desperately kneeling to see her son’s face his right eye was bruised. Deianira smiled at him.  “It is a gift of mine dear sister” she says looking at her half-sister who hardened her gaze when she saw the delicate features of the girl intact.  The crown princess shouldered Nira tightly and at that moment Alicent entered the room and at the sight of the scene ran to separate her daughter from the hands of Rhaenyra.  “Enough stop!” the green queen shouted and held her child in her arms. Then her gaze landed on Aegon “What happened Aegon?”  The teenager rolled his eyes.  “It was your precious daughter mother” he says blood dripping from his nose some parts were drying up on his skin leaving crimson spots “Deianira attacked us for no reason!” The girl tried to get out of Alicent’s arms wishing to throw herself on Aegon again.  “You’re a liar Aegon I swear I’ll…-!&quot;she shouted but a voice rose over hers.  &quot;Enough!” the king exclaimed drawing everyone’s attention towards him an Aemond all covered with what seemed to be dust was by his side. The boy walked into Alicent’s arms taking refuge on his mother warmth.  “These disputes must end we are family!” the king yelled.  “Father” Rhaenyra spoke and Alicent took her younger child under her grip as she intuited what the white haired woman next words would be 2Princess Deianira has come too far attacked two princes this time she is…uncontrollable2  Alicent sighed smiling powerless and shaking her head softly.  “I know my daughter has had impulsive reactions before but I don’t think this was for no reason” the redhead says looking at her lord husband.  “Aemond was locked in the dragon pit… ” Ser Criston Cole whispered. “The princes were found fighting outside the place” he ended. Viserys looks at Aegon then at Jacaerys asking for explanations with his gaze.  “We were quietly coming out of the pit father and Deianira rushed over us” Aegon explained faking a face to try to get his father pit “She had that mad expression she has everytime she lose her mind”  The silence seized the room and Aemond broke it. His eyes burning with locked tears.  “They gave us a pig!” he shouted his voice weak and shaky the adults present in the room looked at the child and Deianira placed her gaze on the ground feeling the sadness of her older brother “They said they had a dragon for us they mocked and left us there.”  Rhaenyra looked at her younger half-sister and then at Jacaerys disappointed to learn the things her son was doing in her absence.  “A blow over a joke?” the crowned princess asked but her voice sank into the depths of her throat. No one had words for what happened.   Viserys was the first to speak after a while.  “Apologize and forget the situation” the King proposed but Deianira shaked softly her head  “How many situations can we forget father?” she murmured “Are you going to keep pretending that this family hasn’t been broken for years?”  Aemond took his younger sister’s hand trying to shut her up.  “What did you said?” Viserys asks approaching his daughter who does not look down or flinch.  “What you heard” Deianira says her amethyst eyes on her father piercing deeply on his soul “One day there will come a situation that no member of this family will ever forget and there’s nothing you will can do about it.”  The man could not say anything at the words of his offspring yet hardened his expression.  “Go to your quarters Deianira I have no desire to see your face today” he speaks his cold and heartless tone of voice makes Alicent feel as her chest sinks into her bones.  “Viserys…she´s is your daughter” the queens whispers but her voice breaks the king looks at his wife and understands that his words were too harsh. But he wasn’t going to back down.  “Don’t worry about me Mother” Nira tries to reassure her “I stopped seeing the king like my father long ago…”  After this the young princess crosses the doorway and leaves letting the tension in the room rise. Rhaenyra looks at Alicent and then at Aemond but not a word comes out of her mouth. And so the gap continues to open further separating the house of the dragon.,2024-07-12 17:30:07 GMT
16,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'daemon targaryen'  'otto hightower'],tearsofthedrag0n,The irony of the whole Otto Vs Daemon is that neither are wrong nor right about one another.   Otto was ambitious and put himself first.  But so was Daemon - maybe he wouldn’t have actively betrayed Viserys but his very way of doing things constantly destabilised the realm.   Both allowed there insecurities of being a second son drive there ambition - for Daemon it made him unstable and entitled in his actions for Otto it made him a power hungry vacuum that consumed everything he could.   Both had good and bad qualities that could have served viserys well if they actually worked together and put aside personal ambition.,2024-07-12 17:28:56 GMT

warnings: fluff  my etsy shop: camelot’s scribe | letters from your favorite character  ⋅•⋅⊰∙∘☽༓☾∘∙⊱⋅•⋅  the sun had barely risen over dragonstone casting a soft golden hue across the island fortress. the distant sound of waves crashing against the rocky shore created a soothing rhythm one that you had come to associate with home. as you made your way through the winding corridors of the castle the faint smell of the sea lingered in the air mingling with the scent of burning candles and freshly baked bread.  in the heart of dragonstone your mother rhaenyra targaryen sat by the large wooden table in her chambers poring over maps and letters. her presence was commanding her silver-gold hair cascading down her back and her eyes the same striking violet as yours filled with determination and love.  “good morning mother” you greeted her entering the room with a small smile.  rhaenyra looked up her stern expression softening as she saw you. “good morning my sweet dragon” she replied her voice warm and melodic. “come sit with me.”  you crossed the room and took a seat beside her. despite the weight of her responsibilities rhaenyra always made time for you her child. it was a promise she had made to herself and one she never broke.  “how are you feeling today?” she asked reaching out to gently touch your hand.  “better” you replied though the concern in her eyes told you she knew better. “i was hoping we could spend some time together today.”  rhaenyra nodded a knowing smile playing on her lips. “of course. i’ve finished most of my duties for the morning. what would you like to do?”  “can we go for a ride on syrax?” you asked your eyes lighting up at the thought of flying with your mother on her magnificent dragon.  rhaenyra’s smile widened and she stood up offering her hand. “i think that sounds like a wonderful idea.”  together you made your way to the dragon pit where syrax awaited. the great golden dragon let out a low rumble as she saw rhaenyra approach her eyes gleaming with recognition. with practiced ease rhaenyra helped you climb onto syrax’s back before mounting herself.  as syrax took to the skies you felt the familiar rush of wind against your face the exhilaration of flight filling your heart. rhaenyra’s arms wrapped securely around you her warmth and strength a comforting presence.  “you know your father loved to fly” rhaenyra said her voice carrying over the roar of the wind. “it was one of the things we bonded over when we were young.”  you turned to look at her curiosity piqued. “will you tell me more about him?”  rhaenyra’s eyes softened and she nodded. “of course my love. your father was a brave and noble man with a heart full of passion and fire. he loved deeply and fiercely much like you.”  as she spoke you felt a sense of connection to a past you had never known a bond that transcended time and space. the stories of your father’s bravery and love filled you with pride and a deeper understanding of your own heritage.  hours passed as you flew together sharing stories and laughter. when you finally returned to dragonstone the sun was beginning to set casting a warm golden light over the castle.  later that evening as you prepared for bed a knock on your door interrupted your thoughts. rhaenyra entered holding a folded piece of parchment in her hand.  “i wrote something for you” she said her voice soft and filled with emotion. “i thought it might bring you comfort when i’m not around.”  you took the letter from her your heart swelling with love and gratitude. “thank you mother.”  rhaenyra kissed your forehead her touch tender and loving. “goodnight my sweet dragon. sleep well.”  as she left the room you unfolded the letter and began to read:  my dearest child  in the quiet moments when i am alone with my thoughts my heart often turns to you. i see in you the strength and spirit of our ancestors the fire of the targaryens burning brightly within your soul. it is a fire that will guide you

will forever be with you. be brave my sweet dragon and let your heart guide you. trust in yourself for you have a strength within you that is unmatched.  with all my love mother  tears filled your eyes as you read the letter each word a testament to your mother’s love and devotion. you folded it carefully and placed it under your pillow a precious reminder of the bond you shared.  as you drifted off to sleep you felt a sense of peace and comfort knowing that no matter what challenges lay ahead your mother’s love would always be there to guide and protect you.  ⋅•⋅⊰∙∘☽༓☾∘∙⊱⋅•⋅

20,House of the Dragon,['rhaenyra targaryen'  'aegon ii targaryen'],aroacegodess,I think one of the reasons for Aegon’s hatred of Rhaenyra is the love she gives to her sons. where he certainly got affection but not much else from Alicent. him and all his siblings (Helaena Aemond and Daeron)    Rhaenyra’s sons can confide in her she will give them advice and above all maternal love.    Let’s remember that Aegon and Rhaenyra are almost 16-17 years apart I’m just saying that Aegon would have liked to have Rhaenyra as a mother rather than Alicent.  It’s just my opinion my darlings! 🐲❤,2024-07-12 18:14:15 GMT

Y/n was the first-born daughter of Rhaenrya Targaryen and Laenor Velayron unlike her brothers who shared the likeness of Ser Harwin Strong. Y/n was a striking resemblance to Rhaenrya with silver hair lilac eyes and a duplicate personality of Laenor. Y/n was the gift and surprise from Rhaenrya and Laenor’s first and only time of consummation on their wedding night to please King Viserys—his first grandchild—a true Targaryen and Velayron. When discussion arose about marriage at the family dinner Queen Alicent looked between her sons and at Rhaenrya standing from her chair and raising her glass. “We are both mothers seeking what’s best for our children and safeguarding our families. Viserys and I have decided that we would like to extend a marriage proposal between yours and Laenor’s daughter Y/n and Aegon. We believe they will be a suitable match and a balanced King and Queen together someday.” Alicent spoke.   Rhaenrya looked at her daughter with questioning eyes Y/n gave a reassuring nod. Aemond’s fist tightened on the table. Y/n’s lilac eyes gazed over him and his face hardened with anger. She would have preferred to marry Aemond not that she had anything against Aegon; she got along with both brothers. But she felt at one with Aemond as she always had; she could feel the heat of his gaze burning into her. She could also feel Aegon’s hand brush hers his fingers lacing around her delicate palm. “Mother what excellent news indeed. Don’t fret sister. I’ll do my best as her husband and King” he grinned at Rhaenrya. Aegon chuckled looking at his younger brother’s distaste at the news. “Oh look Aemond is not happy” he whispered in Y/n’s ear while he sipped his wine and Y/n looked down. “Aegon don’t anger him” she whispered back looking at the older Targaryen. Aegon smiled leaning back on his chair. Rhaenrya nodded. “Thank you Your Grace that is a splendid match.” She too raised her cup. Daemon rolled his eyes looking at Y/n his dark eyes translating his words. “Are you sure?” the corner of Y/n’s lips quirked in a smile and she nodded softly. “I’m sure” Daemon winked and ate some grapes. The room filled with laughter and music as the Targaryen and Hightower families were a happy family for once.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; As time passed Aegon and Y/n spent their days together flying on their dragons Sunfyre and Moonfyre. Both dragons were siblings. Sunfrye was named ‘Sunfyre the Golden’ for his gleaming golden scales and pale pink wings. He truly was a beautiful dragon and a beautiful comparison to Y/n’s Moonfyre. The older female dragon is slender in shape with glistening violet scales and opal wings. Aemond would watch from afar; his jaw clenched his fingers twirling a coin anxiously. He should be the one flying with her on their dragons. He hated hearing their laughter echo through the halls of the Red Keep. Aegon’s arm wrapped around her waist her hand delicately on his arm and their exchanged eye contact. Y/n would feel the burning fire of Aemond’s gaze. The dragon was growing restless and more tiresome of the display of affection between his brother and the woman he should be betrothed to. Y/n’s eyes would occasionally drift from Aegon to Aemond; the sparkling lilac would dance with the sun’s reflections or fires dancing flame. Sweeping lashes cast a sultry gaze her cupid’s bow lips parting briefly. Aemond would smirk in response his tongue swiping his bottom lip drinking her in. He couldn’t take it anymore.  Storming into his mother’s chambers he breathed angrily “What must I do?” He questioned Alicent who looked over her shoulder. “Do what Aemond?” She replied to her son her green dress flowing in the mid-day summer breeze. “Aegon is not worthy of Y/n. A much more beneficial match would be with me Mother.” Aemond grunted putting his hands on the table with a thump. Alicent blinked a soft sigh escaping her lips. She turned to face her youngest son who was walking around the table. She put a hand on Aemond’s shoulder. “Why has this arrangement made you this way?” Aemond’s eye darkened. “I know my brother is not easily satisfied with just one woman. He is always finding himself in the Streets of Silk. He would not be faithful to Y/n; she would be left alone. We all know how dangerous it is for a woman to be alone with her thoughts. She and I are closer. We share the same…” Aemond paused sitting on the chair and pouring a wine. “Interests shall I put it.” Alicent sat in front of Aemond smiling sadly “The King and I have spoken countless times. Your brother needs someone to balance him; he’s sometimes an imbecile. That is why Y/n will help correct what we can’t. They can bring out the best in one another so we chose Aegon. It was nothing untoward you Aemond.” Alicent explained watching Aemond grip the cup tightly his knuckles turning white before releasing his grip and nodding. A smile on his lips. “Very well Mother. That is all I needed to hear” he stood up leaving the chambers. Alicent rested her head on her hand rubbing her temples. “Don’t do anything stupid Aemond” she whispered.   One morning Y/n was ready to fly with Aegon on their dragons when a maid told her he was still sleeping. He had overindulged in wine the night before and was in no condition to go flying. Y/n sighed heavily slumping on the window frame. Aemond moved from the shadows and approached Y/n from behind. “Just because my brother is in no condition to fly does not mean I am not” His smooth voice made Y/n smile. She turned around and stood up her eyes meeting his. “Why do I have a sneaky suspicion you have something to do with this?” She teased Aemond and chuckled his hands behind his back. “I am responsible for many things but my brother losing himself in his wine is not one of them” he stated Y/n nodded. “Well no matter then. If you believe Vhagar can withstand an early morning flight then let’s fly” she smirked. Running down the hall Aemond grinned and chased after her.   The dragon pit roared to life as Vhagar and Moonfyre awoke from their nightly slumber; the two female dragons nudged one another’s heads gently together in greeting. Vhagar’s size was exceedingly larger than Moonfyre’s but that never deterred the younger and smaller dragon from the Queen of all Dragons. Their riders ensured a special bond between themselves would rub off on their dragons. The she-dragons stretched their wings moving off the ground seeing their riders approach them. “Vhagar will have no issue keeping up with Moonfyre. Don’t dismiss the Queen of all Dragons” Aemond whispered in Y/n’s ear his lip ghosting her neck his hand pressed to her stomach. Y/n’s lashes fluttered up meeting her cousin’s heated gaze. “I made no such accusation Aemond. I have faith in Vhagar; after all her rider is more than capable.” She murmured their lips an inch away. Aemond’s eye fell on Y/n’s lips fingers hovering over her cheek. A hum rumbled from his closed mouth. “Careful little one” he breathed sending a shiver down her back. The dragons rumbled. Both Y/n and Aemond looked over with apologetic looks the anxious dragons ready to fly. Y/n smoothed her hand over Moonfyre’s delicate scales; the beast rumbled her eyes closing at the touch of her rider. “Se vēzos iksis bāne tubī moonfyre. Kesi daor sagon hen bōsa. Aegon se Sunfyre kessa daor sagon joining īlva tubī. Aemond se Vhagar issi” (The sun is warm today Moonfyre. We will not be out long. Aegon and Sunfyre will not be joining us today. Aemond and Vhagar are.) Y/n spoke in Valyrian. Aemond watched in awe listening to Y/n’s angelic voice. His Adam’s apple bopped his hands gripping the reins tightly. Looking away he leant down laying his gloved hand on Vhagar “Vhagar ivestragī Moonfyre jemagon se ñuhoso” (Vhagar let Moonfyre lead the way) Moonfyre let out a roar and took flight. Her violet body glittered in the sun’s rays and Vhagar’s large wings lifted her off the ground taking her to the air and following the younger dragon. “Māzigon ūndegon īlva Vhagar!” (Come catch us Vhagar!) Y/n’s voice carried through the sky. Aemond grinned urging Vhagar to fly faster; the Queen roared following the command and chasing after Y/n and Moonfyre.  Laughing Y/n leant back and adjusted the reins guiding Moonfyre to sweep down the younger dragon making a sound of glee. The two dragons flew in harmony playfully chasing one another and their riders enjoying the carefree moment to themselves. Finding land nearby Aemond told Vhagar to land Moonfyre following closely behind the dragons rumbling and chittering to one another. Aemond climbed down Vhagar walking over to Moonfyre his arms stretched to help Y/n down. Placing his hands on her waist and guiding her down Y/n slipped falling into his arms. He smirked “Ziry bē vestragon hae ao jeldan nyke naejot ūndegon ao byka mēre” (It almost seems like you wanted me to catch you little one) Aemond breathed softly his nose nudged Y/n’s affectionately. Her hand pressed on Aemond’s chest feeling his heartbeat. “Aōha prūmia iksis beating adere” (Your heart is beating fast) Y/n whispered. Aemond’s hands gripped her coat tightly “Gaomas ziry surprise ao?” (Does it surprise you?) He replied with a hint of amusement Y/n shook her head lightly before moving away towards Vhagar. “You still fly so beautifully Vhagar no matter how old you are.” she pressed her head to the giant beast’s head. A deep rumble vibrated through Vhagar’s body her bright emerald eyes gleaming at Y/n’s praise. Aemond spoke hushedly to Moonfyre the young dragon taking flight. Y/n spun around looking at Aemond. The Prince smiled “Don’t worry Vhagar and I will protect you.” He wrapped an arm around Y/n’s waist and the two walked together through the forest. “Are you happy about your marriage arrangement with Aegon?” Aemond questioned his gloved hands behind his back Y/n observed the Prince. She could hear the tension in his voice. Stepping closer to him she put a hand on his chest. “Sometimes I know Aegon can drown himself in his cups and amongst other things. But your mother hasn’t shown Aegon much love. And our father and grandsire well for so long he’s never once given any of his children a-” she stopped speaking walking ahead. Aemond frowned following behind before grasping her waist and pinning her to a tree.  Y/n let out a breath “I only mean to say Aegon is the way he is because of his growing up. I don’t blame him for finding solitude in his wine and late-night adventures in the Streets of Silk. Aemond your brother is not what people say he is. And if I am able to help him as his wife then-” Aemond’s nose flared and he pressed his body to hers firmly. “Answer my question properly.” He whispered his voice rumbling. Y/n stared into his eye. “Are you happy about your marriage arrangement with Aegon?” Aemond questioned her again. Y/n blinked softly his head pressed to hers and their lips brushed. “Gaoman jaelagon īles ao” (I do wish it was you) Y/n told him. Aemond’s lips quirked into a gentle smile “Kostan gīmigon iā ñuhoso naejot dohaeragon ao byka mēre” (I may know a way to help you little one)  Y/n breathed tremulously; she and Aemond stood silently before his lips captured hers in a heated kiss. “Aemond” Y/n breathed between the broken kisses. The Prince hummed in response his kisses trailing along her jaw down to her neck. Wrapping a leg around Aemond’s waist pulling him closer their mouths tangled in a passionate kiss Aemond’s hands cupped her face. “He can’t have you” he panted his hips rolled against Y/n’s roughly. The young Princess moaned her hands gripping Aemond’s shoulders for support. “I won’t let him have you. Do not worry little one I have a plan.” he smiled.  When Vhagar had flown back to King’s Landing Aegon walked onto his balcony his eyes narrowed in anger. “Aemond” he growled drowning the rest of his wine and leaving his chambers. Aegon marched down the steps when the Prince and Princess entered the castle. “My love I was worried I could not find you when I came to your chambers. I see my brother kept you company. I do apologise; I lost myself in the dornish wine again.” Aegon apologised. Y/n smiled holding Aegon’s hands and shaking her head. “No need to apologise. I am no stranger to the taste of dornish wine myself. Aemond wanted to take Vhagar on a fly and he offered to accompany Moonfyre and me” Aegon nodded with a smile.  “Yes my brother is always so accommodating and there to save the day” Y/n looked between the brothers sensing the tension building. “I feel a little tired. I might take a rest in my chambers. I’ll see you both for dinner this evening” She kissed Aegon’s cheek and looked at Aemond bowing her head before leaving the brothers. “Yes my sweet do rest. I wouldn’t want my betrothed to be tired later” Aegon eyed Aemond. The younger brother smirked when Y/n was no longer in sight. Aegon pushed Aemond back. “How dare you she is to marry me. ME! Don’t you try anything Aemond. Mother chose me not you. Must you always be such an overbearing fucking cunt trying to overshadow me? What did you do with her?” He asked his younger brother Aemond remained stoic and silent. Aegon narrowed his eyes. “I asked you a question brother” He spat Aemond smirked. “Nothing you need to worry about.” He answered before walking away up the stairs. Aegon threw his arms up. “That is not an answer Aemond!” He shouted. His voice echoed through the halls. Aemond chuckled to himself walking through the Red Keep to his chambers.   Dinner that evening had been tense; Aegon and Aemond glared at one another. Y/n was seated between them; she tried to remain neutral and keep them both cool-headed but to no avail. Alicent sensed something was wrong and she knew her children too well. Haelena mumbled to herself speaking in her riddles. “A dragon will no longer be pure.” Y/n sipped her wine when Aegon spoke up. “So brother you never answered me earlier when I asked what you and my future wife did on your morning flight. Care to tell me now?” He asked Aemond with a harsh gaze. Aemond sighed. Alicent mumbled “My sons keep some peace please” She ate some meat. Aemond smiled mockingly. “I simply felt Y/n needed some company and if her drunk betrothed couldn’t attend to her. Then there was nothing wrong with such matters is there?” Aemond counter asked looking at Y/n. Aegon swallowed thickly closed his eyes slammed his hand down and charged at Aemond. The two brothers engaging in a fight “Aegon! Aemond!” Y/n shouted trying to stop them but neither of them responded. Aemond grabbed Aegon and threw him on the table breaking it underneath him. Alicent and Haelena gasped “Aemond!” Alicent’s voice rose gripping her dress skirts and marching around. “Both of you childish boys go to your chambers! NOW! I am tired of this” She ordered. Her sons both shared a heated look before departing the dining room. Alicent sighed Y/n brushed her dress. “Your Grace may I be excused?” Y/n asked softly. Alicent smiled nodding. “Of course sweetling” she answered Y/n curtsied and left the room walking through the Red Keep and finding her chambers. Walking inside she sighed heavily and turned around beginning to untie her dress before stopping. Aemond was sitting at her desk on her chair his leg crossed over the other.   “Aemond” She spoke in a warning tone; he raised his brow. “He deserved it” He murmured. Walking over she inspected him for injuries; his hand gripped her wrist placing a tender kiss on her pulse. “I am fine little one” he whispered Y/n climbed onto his lap. “You mustn’t fight with him. It will only make things worse” She said. Aemond raked his fingers through loose strands of Y/n’s silver hair. “You were worried about me; I do find it most endearing.” His deep mischievous blue eye sent a shiver through her body goosebumps forming on her skin. Aemond pulled her by the waist onto his lap. Y/n placed her hand on his chest and leaned down to lay her head on his. “Sometimes I feel like you deliberately start fights so I do worry about you” she said quietly kissing him softly. Aemond moaned his palms gripping her dress and sliding up to her waist. Sweeping her up and resting her on the desk Aemond’s hands slid under dress skirts his bare hands coming in contact with her thighs. Moaning into the kiss Y/n’s arms looped around his neck her body falling back slightly. Aemond parted her legs and standing between them Y/n’s fingers carefully unclasped Aemond’s eye patch revealing his sapphire-jewel eye. “Ao mazverdagon tolī handsome each tubis ñuha dārilaros” (You grow more handsome each day my prince) Y/n smiled admiring his facial features. The Targaryen Prince smirked his thumb sliding along her bottom lip slowly. “Se ao continue naejot tempt nyke lēda aōha alluring ways.” (And you continue to tempt me with your alluring ways) Aemond admitted with a hushed voice making it seem like people were listening to their conversation. Y/n’s lilac eyes fluttered delicately her pouted lips parted and her chest rose and fell unevenly. Aemond’s eye wandered over her body; ever entranced by her she was almost like a nymph or goddess.   “Gaomagon ao drējī jaelagon bisa? lo ao jaelagon naejot sagon lēda nyke kesan dīnagon ao isse se ways hen uēpa Valyria. Se kesan fulfil tolvie mēre hen aōha jorrāelagon aōha desires se dreams. Ñuha prūmia belongs naejot ao; ziry va moriot ēza. Ivestragon nyke iksan skoros emā longed syt. Kesan tepagon jeme yno” (Do you truly want this? If you wish to be with me I will marry you in the ways of Old Valyria. And I will fulfil every one of your needs your desires and dreams. My heart belongs to you; it always has. Tell me I am what you have longed for. I will give you all of me.) Aemond pleaded. Y/n could hear the vulnerability in his voice her lips grazing with his both of their soft pants of breath mixing. “Kessa Aemond. Nyke tepagon ñuha prūmia body se soul naejot ao willingly. Mazverdagon nyke aōha ābrazȳrys gō se laesi hen sīkuda. Claim nyke hae aōhon gō gods. Nyke mērī desire ao” (Yes Aemond. I give my heart body and soul to you willingly. Make me your wife under the eyes of the Seven. Claim me as yours before gods. I only desire you.) Y/n confessed a high-pitched moan fell from her open lips when Aemond rolled his hips grinding his hard-clothed cock onto her wet undergarments. Her head lulled back as she leaned on her elbows for support. Aemond grinned kissing her upper chest exposed from the low neckline of her dress. A trail of fire following his kisses woke up her throat and neck. Continuing to rock his hips Y/n whimpered at the overwhelming sensations. “Aemond” she breathed her fingers digging into his leather coat; the Targaryen prince chuckled into her skin his tongue swiping out to lap at her pulse. “Shh ivestragī nyke raqagon ao” (Shh let me enjoy you). His velvety voice made her back arch from the wooden desk into the warmth of his body.   One of Aemond’s hands disappeared between Y/n’s legs his knife cutting her undergarments effortlessly. Y/n gasped feeling the coolness of his knife’s blade come in contact with her wet folds. Aemond teased her entrance with the hilt of his knife gently moving it up and down her arousal coating the tip. Y/n’s hips moved against his knife hilt her hazy mind filled with lust. Aemond pulled away from kissing her neck and raised his head looking at Y/n’s closed eyes and parted lips the string of moans falling making him grin. Removing his knife he raised it to inspect Y/n opened her eyes noticing Aemond’s playful smirk “Ao vestragon naejot emagon vēttan mirrī mess hen ñuha egry byka mēre” (You seem to have made a little mess of my knife little one) He remarked with a wink his tongue flattened as he licked her arousal of the hilt. Moaning at the taste his eye closed Y/n felt her cheeks turn crimson and hot at watching Aemond lick her wetness. Throwing his knife down he spun swiftly picking Y/n up off the desk and carrying her to the bed. Laying her down he spread her legs eagerly Y/n tried to work quickly on unlacing her dress so he wouldn’t destroy the material. “Aōha sylutegon ēza pālegīon nyke rather savage nyke apologise” (Your taste has turned me rather savage I apologise) Aemond growled crawling between her parted legs and wasting no time and diving in. Y/n moaned loudly her fingers raking through his hair gripping the roots tightly spurring him on.   He turned into a feral man desperate to ravage her until he had his fill. Aemond’s hands held Y/n’s hips to the bed her body arching jolting writhing underneath her lover’s tongue. A thin sheen layer of sweat built underneath her chemise the air thick with the sounds of Aemond’s greedy lapping of his mouth devouring her cunt and her chorus of moans. Aemond swiped the point of his tongue from her entrance to her clit. His lips latched and sucked on her swollen pearl delicately. His devoted attention and mix of fast and teasing pace made Y/n’s thighs quake with pleasure. “Aemond!” She gasped sharply feeling his teeth graze her clit. Humming into her cunt the vibrations send pleasure coursing through her body. “Nyke dōrī jaelagon naejot henujagon bisa delicious orvorta. Kesan spend ñuha tubissa se bantior worshipping aōha lovely orvorta ēva ñuha mōrī jelevre” (I never want to leave this delicious cunt. I will spend my days and nights worshipping your lovely cunt until my last breath.) Aemond grunted pushing Y/n’s legs up Aemond pressing his nose to her clit his mouth enveloping her folds losing himself in her scent. Her taste. “Nyke’d happily ivestragī ao ñuha zaldrīzes” (I’d happily let you my dragon Y/n whined her hips rolling against Aemond’s face earning a moan of approval from her lover. The fire building in her lower belly became more evident her fingers gripping Aemond’s silver locks harder. “Aemond I feel something. Please don’t stop!” She cried out. Aemond flattened his tongue licking broad stripes up her wet folds. Blowing air on her clit Aemond smirked “Māzigon syt nyke byka mēre; jaelan aōha pleasure” (Come for me little one; I want your pleasure) Aemond’s smooth voice made her whimper feeling his mouth latch back on her cunt once again his focus solely trained on her reaching her peak.  Feeling her heels dig into Aemond’s back she gripped the bedspread. “Aemond…I…” she tried to speak but was cut by a broken moan. Her body convulsed the last flick of Aemond’s tongue sending her over the edge. Savouring every drop once satisfied with his work Aemond pulled away his chin and lips glistening with her wetness. Y/n giggled lightly at the sight before pulling him down for a passionate kiss their tongues dancing together Y/n’s legs wrapped around Aemond’s torso pulling his body to hers firmly. His palm cupped her cheek the other focusing on removing her chemise; pulling away from the kiss Y/n assisted in removing her thin material clothing while Aemond undressed hastily. Both silently admire one another. Aemond kissed her knee tenderly trailing up her thigh to her stomach and body. Draping a leg around his waist he lowered his toned body onto Y/n’s feeling her bare skin touch his. Both let out a gentle sigh at the contact. Aemond kissed under her breasts sucking the skin gently before paying attention to her nipples with love. Moving from her breasts Aemond kissed Y/n’s jaw nibbling lightly proceeding to press his lips to hers once again.  Smiling into the kiss Y/n slid her hands down Aemond’s body. “Remind nyke bona eman naejot repay se favour hen pleasing ao lēda ñuha relgos hembar jēda” (Remind me that I have to repay the favour of pleasing you with my mouth next time) Aemond laughed at the comment nodding his head “Iksan sure nyke won’t jorrāelagon naejot; kesā sagon begging naejot kostilus nyke gō nyke sesīr jiōragon se chance naejot remind ao” I’m sure I won’t need to; you will be begging to please me before I even get the chance to remind you) Aemond growled his tongue swiping her bottom lip his eye darkened with fiery lust. Y/n smiled brushing her nose with his “Whatever you wish if you want me to beg then I will” she whispered his lip curled into a snarl his carnal desire flowing through his blood hot with the fire of the dragon and lining himself at her wet entrance. His hands gripped her waist. “Jaelan naejot sagon gentle lēda ao syt se ēlī jēda. Yn iksā verdagon ziry impossible syt nyke naejot withhold nykēla. Ao seductress she-dragon” (I want to be gentle with you for the first time. But you are making it impossible for me to withhold myself. You seductress she-dragon) Aemond hissed pressing his head to hers. “Iksan vaoreznuni ñuha zaldrīzes” (I’m sorry my dragon). She whispered pecking his lips gently feeling the dragon’s body relax his calm demeanour surfacing his cheek rubbed against hers. “Ȳdra daor. Nyke dōrī jaelagon naejot rȳbagon vestrā vaoreznuni. Daor while īlon share īlva bed” (Don’t. I never want to hear you say sorry. Not while we share our bed) Aemond murmured he kissed her cheek resting his weight on his forearm his other hand guiding the head of cock in between her legs. Releasing a shuddering breath at the feeling of her tight walls accommodating his shaft. Y/n gasped softly tears pricking her eyes. Aemond leant down kissing them away sheathing himself fully inside. Pausing to let her adjust to his size he intertwined one of his hands with hers lacing their fingers. “Ao ivestragon nyke skori kostan dīnagon byka she-dragon. Nyke ȳdra daor jaelagon naejot ōdrikagon ao” (You tell me when I can move little she-dragon. I don’t want to hurt you) He purred with a smile Y/n stared into his eye nodding her head permitting him to continue. Aemond moaned lowly his body thrusting up feeling his cock hit Y/n’s sweet spot. Her body wriggled underneath him. Aemond hummed soothingly feeling her body relax under his touch; the sinful sounds falling from her lips made his cock twitch inside her warm walls.   “Faster ñuha zaldrīzes kostilus” (Faster my dragon please) Y/n mewled urging Aemond to move his thrusts growing faster as she asked. “Gaomas bona feel sȳz ñuha zaldrītsos. Īlē vēttan syt nyke? Daor syt Aegon. Nyke” (Does that feel good my little dragon? You were made for me. Not for Aegon. Me.) He grunted his jaw clenched at the thought of Aegon fucking Y/n. He would never get that privilege. Y/n was his. And now he could prove it; he had claimed her as his own. Just like a dragon claims their mate. Y/n nodded at Aemond’s words. “Yes it feels amazing. Aōha orvorta iksis filling nyke sīr deep ñuha zaldrīzes” (Your cock is filling me so deep my dragon). She grinned pushing him off her and rolling him onto his back. He smirked his tongue licking his lips watching her cunt swallow his cock her hands laid on his chest. “Kipagon aōha zaldrīzes pār. Gūrogon skoros ao jorrāelagon hen nyke” (Ride your dragon then. Take what you need from me). Aemond praised his head laid back on the pillow his hands on her hips. Mesmerised by her taking control Aemond groaned at the sight of his love mounting and riding him. “F-fuck kesan daor mōrī olvie longer buried iemnȳ aōha orvorta byka she-dragon” (F-fuck I will not last much longer buried inside your cunt little she-dragon.)  Aemond snarled thrusting up Y/n’s body which faltered slightly as she fell forward. Aemond sat up capturing her lips in a searing kiss. Throwing her head back and arching her body Aemond kissed her breasts his palms supporting her lower back. Their bodies were covered in layers of sweat the air smelt of sex and the sounds of their moans echoed in the chambers. “Aemond my dragon I’m close” She whispered her lips brushing his. Aemond nodded pulling her closer their bodies glued to one another. “Come with me little dragon; let me feel you come undone around my cock.” He panted feeling her walls clench around him her lilac eyes wide her hand cupping his face little gasps emitting from her lips. Aemond felt her body begin to contract in pleasure; pulling her close he grunted “Sīr gevie skori aōha fucked hen va ñuha orvorta” (So beautiful when your fucked out on my cock) Y/n whined kissing Aemond moaning into his mouth as she came around him. Aemond bit her bottom lip gently growling when he felt his cock twitch as he coated her cervix with thick ropes of his cum. “I love you Y/n” Aemond confessed Y/n felt her heart skip a beat and a bright smile appeared. “I love you too Aemond” she replied kissing his lips. Holding her face in both his hands Aemond’s body faltered as he fell back on the bed Y/n giggled into the kiss her hips rocking gently riding out her high. Aemond’s hips turned uneven as he finished. Y/n pulled away from the kiss and she and Aemond breathed heavily. Blissed smiles on their faces. “Is that how it always will be?” she asked him her fingers dancing over his chest. Aemond’s lips quirked into his famous smirk. “Many many times my little she-dragon” he purred.  Alicent asked her children and Y/n to come for breakfast the following day. When they were all seated Alicent spoke up “Aegon we must discuss your and Y/n’s marriage. Aegon nodded with a smile. “Yes Mother I understand you are most anxious to have this marriage done sooner than later” He sipped his wine. Aemond laughed tapping his fingers on the table. Aegon rolled his eyes. “What now?” He asked. Alicent sighed looking between her sons. “Please do not fight again. It’s too early in the morning for such unpleasantries” Alicent warned Aegon and Aemond as Haelena whispered to herself “The dragon is no longer be pure” Aegon caught on to his sister’s riddle pointing to her. “What what do you mean by that? You said something similar last night. A dragon will not be pure” Haelena stared into her older brother’s eyes before flickering her gaze to Aemond. Aegon looked at Aemond with a confused look. “She means that I bedded Y/n last night and with that I intend to marry her and make her my wife.” Aemond smiled looking between his brother and mother. Alicent closed her eyes. “Aemond tell me you did not…” her voice fell quiet. Aegon shook his head. “No no. No no you didn’t. You are lying. You did not fuck her!” He shouted trying to deny what he had just heard throwing his cup on the table. The doors opened as Y/n walked through; sitting beside Aemond sensing tension in the room she frowned. Alicent rested her fingers on her lips. “Y/n sweetling did Aemond bed you last night? You can tell me you are in no trouble” She asked Y/n with a smile Y/n looked at Aemond with wide eyes. “You couldn’t help yourself could you?” She shook her head and looked to Alicent. “Your Grace while I was honoured you believed me to be a match for Aegon in marriage for so long I have loved Aemond. And he too reciprocates my feelings. We want to be wed in the ways of Old Valyria. If you and his Grace the king would allow it so” Y/n spoke. Aemond stretched forward to hold her hand in his. Alicent smiled at the two nodding. “Of course preparations will be made immediately.” Y/n felt relief wash over her as she looked at Aegon who stared at his cup his fingers tapping the rim. “Aegon may I speak to you privately?” Y/n asked the older Targaryen. He looked up at her his eyes softened; he nodded wordlessly following her to the balcony overlooking King’s Landing.   Aegon let out a shaky breath sniffling slightly. “What about my brother confirmed your desire for him?” He asked softly his eyes looking straight ahead Y/n sighed a smile gracing her face. “Everything. Aemond has held a special place in my heart for so long. You both have. Don’t think you haven’t made an impression on me Aegon” Y/n teased him. Aegon gazed at her a beautiful smile appearing on his lips. “You do. You have such a beautiful smile Aegon. You should show it more often” she said nudging his shoulder. Aegon laughed. “But Aemond and I. I can’t explain it; there is just-” she started when Aegon placed his hand on hers. “I understand. You don’t have to explain yourself or Aemond to me. Although there is something I want to ask” he told her leaning on his arm and looking inside before meeting Y/n’s gaze again. “Did he know how to fuck you properly?” He questioned with a wolfish grin. Y/n shook her head with a smile and walked away. Aegon laughed. “I shouldn’t have asked-” He started when Y/n turned to face him. “As it so happens I am finding it hard to stand while talking to you; that is a good sign yes?” Y/n winked with a smirk.   Aegon’s face turned smug as he downed the last of his wine. “OH THAT IS MORE THAN A GOOD SIGN!” He shouted running behind Y/n. “AEMOND YOU SLY BASTARD A CELEBRATION IS IN ORDER!”,2024-07-12 18:14:00 GMT

Blood that runs deep like the weirwood roots in the grounds of the godswood.”   A sweet memory flashes across Aemond’s mind. One where Aemond is climbing the heart tree in the courtyard under the light of the full moon. Helaena is watching him her hands holding a firefly carefully. And she’s smiling watching it light up laughing joyfully. Her incandescence is infectious and it makes Aemond smile too. The fresh scar across his eye still healing stretched taut but not paining him at that precise moment for the first time. For who could ever feel any amount of pain seeing her smile? Her lilac eyes light up brighter than ten thousand fireflies?   He wishes she would smile for him; that her lilac eyes would burn brighter than a hundred thousand fireflies for him.  He needs her to see to truly see.  “Too much blood spilt. Your hands will never be clean no matter how many times you wash them. They will always be stained with crimson with our blood.” Aemond reaches out to cup Helaena’s cheek through her mourning veil but she recoils from his hand pulling from his touch for the first time in her life. “You have cursed me. You have cursed us brother.”  Tears of anger of grief pool in Helaena’s beautiful eyes and Aemond’s hand itches to wipe them away. But instead he grips the hilt of Blackfyre with one and the catspaw dagger with the other hand thinking of the sacrifices the blood he’s spilt—all for her. For them. So they could be free of their brother. So Aemond may finally be hers and Helaena finally his.  “His son’s blood” Aemond breathes out through his flared nostrils deeply anger swirling inside him thinking of his nephew of his brother’s dead son. A son that should have been theirs. “Jaehaerys’ blood may be on my hands. But Aegon’s—our brother’s your husband’s.” Aemond spits the word husbandseeing Helaena’s nostrils flare angry tears fall down her lovely face. “His blood is on both our hands sister. I killed him for you for us. We are both unclean but we may atone for our sins together. As one. As husband and wife Helaena.” Aemond pleads with her his holy words his prayer thinking he would get on his knees for her. Worship her everyday for the rest of his days but his pride his blood is burning hotly with dragonfire having finally achieved his worth as a second son. And all it took was one word one stab to his brother’s heart with their father’s prized dagger.  Aemond can still recall Aegon’s raspy voice his last shallow breath the word brother upon his lips light as Helaena’s kisses peppering his. And he shall have more of those kisses her lips her tongue her body her cunt her heart and soul. Her. For she owes him all of her for he’s given all of himself to her.   “We shall marry under the eyes of the Seven sister. After my coronation when the Septon anoints and places the conqueror’s crown on my head you shall proclaim your loyalty your love for all to see that you are mine. For mother to see that I should have always been your husband.” Aemond smiles his lone eye sparkling with triumph matching the gleam in his sapphire eye but it’s gone the moment Helaena’s open hand collides with his cheek his bottom lip splitting open on his teeth.  “I belong to no one.” Helaena hisses and Aemond touches his lip his tongue tasting coppery iron shocked that she would strike him so fight back. Her wrath and defiance resentment towards him should wake the feral dragon in him but it does something else; stoking the embers of desire of lust deep within. He wants this version of Helaena. His sister who matches the violence simmering under his skin. Someone with the same strength fire and blood.   He wants her to spill more of his blood for she’s the only one allowed to do so.  “Yes you do Helaena. You are mine. All of you. Your body and soul your heart and spirit your cunt.” Aemond licks his lips his eye greedily traversing over her curves hidden beneath the dark green gown itching to rip it to cut it from her body with his dagger. Maybe draw her blood wound her savor and lick it clean.   “No!” Helaena proclaims gritting her teeth her fist now colliding with the side of his scarred cheek. And Aemond laughs deep and the sound echoes off the walls of her bedchambers. “I belong to me alone Aemond Targaryen!” She screams at him hot tears spilling from her eyes like the blood from the wounds Aemond inflicted upon their brother.   Aemond’s cock swells longing to taste her tears to taste all of her. Helaena bares her teeth at him her hands begin to reach for his throat and he growls deep and feral in his chest when they tighten constricting around him.   “Kill me sister.” Aemond rasps her small hands not large enough to do so but he wants her to try. He wants her to see that they are the same for she has the same murderous look in her eyes mirrored in his own eye this very moment. “Kill me and then we will both be kinslayers with our blood stained upon our bare hands. Take my life for your son’s your husband’s. Our brother’s.”  Helaena lets out a feral cry releasing her hold from his throat and Aemond’s inhales and exhales deeply oxygen filling his lungs his cock throbbing with urgency.   He stares deeply into her pained eyes once more and she slaps him across the face again and again harder each time before his fire is a raging beast one untamed as feral as she is.   “Enough fighting me!” He grunts his face burning with her burst of anger her prints imbedded into his skin grabbing her wrist but this only encourages her to struggle against him to attempt to fly away far from him. Hel’s fire just as bright brutally blazing beneath her pale flesh. But Aemond is stronger bigger faster.   And he needs to fuck her have her tight little cunt wrapped around him like her small fingers until he’s spilling his blinding rage inside her succumbing to the sweetness of his sister.  “You are mine and I will have you Hel!” Aemond says possessiveness dripping from his gritted teeth. He tears the dark green veil from her face her braided hair and a lovely look of shock and outrage wash over her features. He kisses her fully on the mouth hard rough no sweetness to be found in this kiss. Because this is about control about his claim. His claim to what is rightfully his.   But his sister’s teeth are as sharp dragon claws and she bites him in the same place his lip is split and Aemond hisses angrily beyond aroused for her.  “N-no! I will never be yours!” She cries out and Aemond grabs her other wrist spinning them around until her back is facing the wall. He presses her against it his fingers constricting around her wrists a tight shackle upon them.   “Never Helaena? Are you so sure about that sister?“ She is trapped caught in the maws of a predator now forever entangled in her brother’s web. Aemond rubs his erect cock against her stomach letting her feel what her delicious volatility does to him before he drags it downward to the apex of her thighs. Helaena gasps staring wide eyed at him her eyes pleading with him. “No. Please.” She begs fresh tears falling down her face terrified. Aemond wonders if she ever begged their brother like this? The thought alone makes his cock ache with intense lust a need so vast to empty inside her.  “Yes sister” Aemond laps up her tears with his tongue leaving his blood streaked in their place across her cheeks. “I need an heir and you need a son.” He towers over her encompassing her petite frame wholly removing one of his hands from around her wrist but keeps the other one around both her delicate wrists in a bruising grip. His immense veined hand threatening to break her entirely.   “A king must have a son and the Seven will bless this holy union with one.” Aemond bunches up Helaena’s skirts prudently desperate to feel her naked folds against his calloused fingertips his hands forever stained in their kin’s blood shall now be stained anew with her sweet elixir her honeyed juices.  Aemond’s hand travels over her stocking covered thighs searching for naked flesh but Helaena isn’t done begging him defying him when she clenches her inner thighs together denying his fingers access to her sacred center.  “Please do not Aemond.” She pleads with her pretty voice her eyes shining with more tears. Aemond’s patience is running thin “spread your thighs apart sister or I will show you the same mercy I showed our brother” he whispers low in her ear feeling her shiver “towards his daughter.”   “You wouldn’t!” Helaena panics trying to pull from Aemond no doubt trying to flee to her daughter. To keep her safe from suffering the same fate her brother and father have. “Jaehaera is blameless! She has done nothing!”  “And you must keep her safe sister. Now behave for me and I promise that no harm will befall your sweet innocent princess.”   Aemond’s lips once again lock onto hers and he swallows down her soft sob his hand insistently pressing against her core. Helaena parts her thighs allowing him access to that intimate part of her he’s coveted ever since his brother was allowed to sample her first.  “Helaena” Aemond gasps when he cups her cunt feeling how utterly drenched her small clothes are. “You’re soaked sweet girl.” His mouth waters wanting to see to smell to taste all of her sweet musk for himself. But his cock demands her cunt and he can no longer deny himself the feeling of it pressed against her her wrapped around all of him.  Aemond’s impatient ripping her small clothes from her body unlacing his leather breeches fiercely freeing his cock. “Were you ever this wet for our brother sweet sister?”  Aemond doesn’t give Helaena time to answer grasping his cock pushing her legs apart wide and pressing himself inside her from crown to root in one swift harsh thrust. He hisses loudly gutturally watching her beautiful stunning flushed face; the way she gasps quietly biting her bottom lip between her teeth her eyes fluttering shut.   Aemond wonders if it is from pain or pleasure? Both?  Because he’s never experienced such an exquisite fiery heat a tightness almost too unbearable to encapsulate comprehend. He never wants to leave; never wishes to part from her sweet body ever.  A body he longs to see coveting the dark green gown covering it entirely from his wandering eye.  Aemond unsheathes his father’s dagger from its sleeve keeping his cock still sheathed inside his sister heart skipping a beat. She opens her eyes suddenly gasping concern shadowing her face. “W-What are you doing?” She questions him squeezing him tightly for a moment her hands clenched into tight fists not daring to touch him but threatening to do worse.  “Fuck stay still before I cut you!” Aemond grunts imagining her milky skin painted with blood; licking cleaning it up. Her chest expands with air as she breathes in deeply in and out of her lungs before staying completely frozen watching him with worried eyes as he slices through her silk dress easier than flesh. She gasps again shivering the fabric falling away like a second skin until he’s cutting through the front of her bodice leaving her in just her shift.   He eyes a speckle of blood just above her right breast near her heart dripping down towards her peaked rosy nipple. And his veins roar with dragonfire hungering longing to taste to satiate his inner predator.  The dagger clatters to the stone and Aemond undoes his sword belt letting it fall to the floor next to her tattered gown. He grips Helaena by her ass his fingers digging into the plump flesh finally making her moan. “Wrap your legs around me Hel.” Aemond whispers against the crook of her neck and she heeds his command her legs winding tightly around his torso at the same time he latches on her pulse with his lips directly onto the slight scar left behind marking the spot her blood was spilt that fateful night her son was slain. He groans against her flesh his tongue gliding down to suck at the slice just above the roundness of her breast.  “Aemond” Helaena speaks sweetly breathless without disgrace disgust or shame; shuddering against him now her hands touching him of their own accord. And it makes him wickedly wanton when her fingers begin threading into his hair tugging desperately onto his silver strands.   “Helaena” he hisses his lips kissing the top of her breast her heartbeat thundering underneath him staggeringly. “Helaena” he says again repeating it needing her to hear him “my sweet sweet sister.” He thrusts in and out of her cunt shallowly sucking her hardened nipple into his mouth through the sheer shift. Helaena’s fingernails dig half moon indents into his scalp and he hisses biting down onto her sensitive nub.   “More harder” Helaena hisses back her nails scraping against his scalp and this time she draws blood; his blood now staining her hands. “Fuck me Aemond” her walls flutter around his cock menacingly choking him. And he’s a slave to her demands craves it more than he can fathom.   But he needs to hear the words he craves cannot live without before he succumbs to her his sister his future wife and queen—the mother of his children.  “Say it Helaena” Aemond rasps against her breast throat thick with emotion head pounding with the overwhelming lust that storms inside him. “Say it” he murmurs against her skin his tongue trailing upwards traveling the familiar path towards her plump pomegranate red lips. “Say it sister. Say the words and I will fuck you.” He kisses her lips gingerly then her fevered cheek finally sucking her ear lobe into his mouth seductively. Helaena whimpers her grip on his silky hair softening as she melts against him like molten gold. The sun curving against the crescent of the most lustrous resplendent silver slivered moon.  “Yours brother I am yours.” She confesses and there is nothing but verity vulnerable honesty in her honeyed voice and Aemond growls slamming her back against the wall of his bedchambers his hands tearing the shift from her body fondling groping every inch of her nakedness selfishly. Her teats her ass her hips the curve of her belly. “Mine mine mine.” He chants over and over again afraid he’ll wake up from this dream to the nightmare of Helaena his sister belonging to their fool of a brother. A whoring brother who could never please his sister—not like Aemond can always will.  “Time to fuck you sweet Helaena. Time to show you what it’s like for a king to fuck his queen.” Aemond lifts one of Helaena’s plush thighs over his shoulder hearing her yelp his other hand gripping onto the front of her neck with a gentleness Aemond didn’t know still resided in him.   His eye follows to where they’re conjoined cock connected to cunt and he withdraws half way before thrusting inside her watching hypnotized by how selfishly her orifice swallows him whole devours him so. “I am yours Helaena. Yours sister.” Aemond kisses her lips hungrily his tongue penetrating her mouth while he penetrates her body. Over and over again. Both siblings’ breaths growing shallower his cock fucking into her at a maddening pace.  “More please harder” Helaena pleads seizing a hold of his wrist that’s just holding her throat. “You promised my king” Helaena sucks his bottom lip between her teeth soothing over her tongue and Aemond understands her meaning that she needs the pained pleasure everything that he can offer.   “You’re so tight Hel so feverish and wet. All for me mine until death parts us.” Aemond promises meaning every word with a volatile thrust his adrenaline threatening to burn him hotter than dragon fire consume him from the inside out. His fingers curl around her throat tighter threatening to leave a beautiful array of blossoming bruises as he bottoms out into her cunt roughly brutally hearing her growl low in her throat. His dragon goddess through and through.  &quot;I’m going to come inside you sweet wife. I’m going to give you a son my son our son.” Aemond rasps sweating feeling feverish like he might collapse with how badly he needs this. Every muscle bone and vein aching wearily but he fights through the pain the exertion needing to experience her pleasure her entire being coming undone around him.  So he clutches onto her throat tighter choking her demanding her climax her cunt to choke him tighter cling onto and milk his seed from his body.  “Our son.” Helaena’s shaking her head yes her small breaths labored; little moans and broken gasps escaping her lips. “Choke me my queen take my seed!” Aemond cries his body beginning to shake to tremble his knees threatening to crumble into dust burnt to ash. “Take all of me selfishly for yourself sister. For I am selflessly yours H-Helaena!” Aemond swears groaning loudly when he watches her eyes roll back into her skull her cunt extravagantly vice tight around him stealing his seed his intense pleasure form him. “Gods! Fuck Helaena! Give me everything!” He curses his flames bursting at the seams unspooling and unraveling aggressively as he filthily fucks into her sopping squelching cunt through her climax until Helaena’s putting her hands back around his neck luring her towards him with her sweet plump lips near his.  “Yes yes Aemond everything…my brother. Myhusband.” she rasps out feral her throat parched and Aemond quenches her thirst feeds her his festering fire let’s her drink of his sweet possessive poison giving her everything. All of him for eternity.   Helaena kisses him passionately profoundly blistering vehemence and viciousness lingering on her teeth and tongue.  Aemond hisses both dragons devouring consuming the other selfishly collapsing onto the floor conjoined two bodies as one.  A brother and a sister tangled in one another broken and bruised by the other sewing and stitching the other together…selflessly.,2024-07-12 20:04:51 GMT

(handjob fingering.)  a. note: link to the original request.  They’ve been keeping him from you.  ‘He needs his rest m&#x27;lady.’  That’s all you ever hear.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Well damn rest to the seven hells. Aegon needs you; without your love and support how is he ever supposed to get better?  All evening you’ve stood watch just around the corner from Aegon’s bedchamber on the second floor of the keep under the guise of overseeing the hanging of a new tapestry along the hallway toward the grand staircase.  Once you hear the last maester leaving Aegon’s room and shuffling along for the night you hurriedly dismiss the servants hanging the tapestry and begin to creep down the corridor.  Finding the door unlocked you sweep silently inside.  The room is dark the only illumination the light of the moon slipping in through the windows. Aegon is lying down breathing steady beneath the sheets as you sneak over and settle yourself gingerly on the bed beside him making sure not to rustle any of the bedclothes.  His eyes open instinctively staring amazed up at you clearly not expecting visitors this time of night.  Aegon whispers your name like a prayer. “What are you doing here?”  “I came to see my husband. Am I not allowed to see how his recovery’s going?”  If you’re being honest Aegon looks awful the mottled skin of his cheek purple and red in the low lighting. There are more burns further down and across his shoulder. You ache to hold him but don’t want to hurt him.  You clear your throat. “I just needed to see you my love. It’s been so long….” You reach out avoiding the burn on his cheek as you pet a lock of hair back from his forehead. “Don’t you miss me?”  He watches you carefully. Of course he misses you more than he cares to admit. And he is touched by the gesture even if he’s unwilling to show it right now.  “I miss you” he admits quietly. “More than anything. But I assure you I’m fine. No need to waste your time fussing over me.”  He tries to sit up biting back a pained groan.  “Don’t” you urge pressing him back against the sheets with a hand at his unmarred shoulder.  It’s been a long time since you’ve slept together - the maesters have been keeping Aegon in this room to rest and heal. Even during the day you’ve been forbidden to see him; everyone claims it’s better for him to be alone and &#x27;clear his mind.’  But what about you? It’s been torture not having him beside you at night not holding his hand at meals or at court.  And what about him? Has anyone even asked Aegon what he wants? What he needs while he’s like this?  “What can I do for you Aegon? What do you need?”  “You” he says with no hesitation “to lay here with me.” He pats the space on the opposite side of the bed. That’s what he needs - the woman he cares for most.  “Just…. be careful of my leg. It’s broken if they hadn’t told you….”  You hurry around to his unburnt side climbing carefully back on the bed so as not to disturb his broken leg. “I know…. does it hurt badly still?” You ask quietly tucking yourself against his side.  He wraps his good arm gently around you and rests his chin at the crook of your neck. Your touch soothes him and he’s missed it more than he can say.  “Only when I try to move it. The burns still hurt like all seven hells though….”  You nod - closer now you can see the burns all over the side of his body trailing down beneath the covers. The maesters had told you his injuries were extensive but you didn’t realize just how badly until now.  “Oh Aegon -” you cut yourself off on a choked sob. “Why did you do it? Why did you leave me to go to that wretched battle?”  His heart aches just hearing the sound of you crying. He pulls you as close as he can with one arm.  “Shh….” He shushes you running fingers through your hair. “I had to go. I couldn’t let what they’d done go unpunished. The people need their king to fight for them.”  You sniffle. Not wanting to get snot and tears all over him in addition to his other tragedies you calm yourself with a hand at the remaining smooth skin of his stomach. “I just can’t believe they’ve kept you here away from me. It’s been so difficult Aegon….”  “I know my love I know….”  He pulls you against his chest and lets you rest your head there against his beating heart seemingly the only thing that had not been damaged in the battle.  “It’s been difficult for me too…. I thought of you every day….”  It comforts you to know Aegon has been thinking of you even as sick as he is.  You lick your lips fingers circling gently over his stomach. “You have? Have you been able to…. pleasure yourself at all?”  A shiver runs through him and he lets out a shaky exhale. “Only once. I tried a few times though….” His voice is a whisper as he speaks his body reacting even to the simplest of your touches.  You kiss his shoulder in sympathy. “You must be so pent up. I mean…. I know I am” you say suggestively.  “Yes” he breathes. He is desperate. The touch of your lips to his shoulder is enough to send heat shooting straight down. “You don’t even know…. but….” He swallows thickly. “I don’t know how I would….”  He turns his face from you in shame.  “Shh Aegon it’s okay.” You turn his face back toward you cradling him gently just below the heated scrape of burn. “I wouldn’t expect that right now…. You need to heal more before that. But there are always other ways to make sure you get your release …”  His eyes one darkened by the brindled skin surrounding it fix on you. They are both however hungry and wanting. “Other ways?” He whispers.  You nod smiling sweetly at your husband. “Yes many other ways. I can think of two off the top of my head that won’t be too taxing for you…. shall we try them?”  Aegon mirrors your nod. “Try them yes. I’m desperate. I’ll do anything as long as you’re the one doing it….”  With another kiss to his shoulder you let the very tips of your fingers trail just beside the jagged line of burns along Aegon’s body making sure not to hurt him. You want to tease to make this as good for him as possible.  You’ve been apart for a month at least; if Aegon is anywhere near as tense as you are he will appreciate this.  But just as your fingers are about to traipse under the sheets Aegon stops you with a grunt. “Darling…. one thing first.”  You gaze curiously up at him.  “Are you still…. Do these bother you?” He gestures to the slowly healing burns along his face and side. “Do you still find me as handsome as you once did or am I….”  He can’t seem to find the words to finish.  You shush him yet again pressing a loving kiss to his lips. “You will always be the most beautiful man in the world to me Aegon. No matter what.”  “You…. you still find me…. pleasing to look at like this?”  You lean up on your elbow fingers now taking their time trailing over his stomach up to his uninjured shoulder over his unburnt cheek and back down. “Oh Aegon…. I’ve missed you so. Is that the real reason you’ve refused to see me? You’re afraid I’ll find you ugly?”  He closes his eyes as your fingers wander over him his breath hitching in his throat at the pleasure of your touch but the question makes him pause.  “Yes” he admits without any attempt to lie. “I don’t want you to look at me and feel nothing but disgust…. I’m not….” He swallows and opens his eyes gaze blazing into you “I was afraid you would think me hideous.”  Gods the fact that you can’t throw your leg over him and just fuck yourself down onto him to show him just how handsome you still find him is driving you mad….  “Why don’t you let me show you hm? Just how attractive I still find you?” You kiss him again his neck this time dry fluttering kisses along his pulse point which has quickened.  Exhaling with a shudder as your lips trail across the sensitive skin of his neck he whispers “Yes…. please.” His eyes are pulled to the tenting in the sheets below.  “You still get hard for me so easily” you reply with a pleased smile gaze also drawn down toward his midriff. “Give me just a moment.”  On the bedside you had spied some oil the maesters had been using to treat Aegon’s wounds. With the vial in hand you retreat back into Aegon’s side slowly pushing the sheets down to reveal his hardened manhood.  You hiss sitting up momentarily to see where the burns wrap around his hip coming dangerously close to his erection. “Will it be okay for me to touch you?”  His breath catches eying the path of the sheets as you remove them.  “It’ll be fine. Please touch me. I want your hands on me need them on me please….” He pleads his eyes darkened with want watching you as you continue to examine the extent of his burns.  “Only be gentle….“ he sighs softly.  &quot;Of course.” You nod fervently bending to press a kiss to his belly.  Curling against his side you reach with the vile to drip just a few spots of oil onto his hard cock. You watch them rain slowly down licking your lips at the sight.  “Gods I missed seeing your cock. Is that weird…?”  Aegon’s length twitches as the oil hits it. He watches you closely moaning at the mere sight of you here with him after so long.  “Not weird” he reassures you. “I-I’ve missed you so much your touch your…. your everything. It’s all I’ve thought about for weeks and the only thing that’s made this bearable.”  Reassured by his sweet words you press your lips to his side. With just one finger you stretch and start to run that finger slowly over Aegon’s slick cock spreading the oil making sure it doesn’t drip too close to his burns. “Aegon…. oh gods …”  You’re trembling wanting him so bad but unable to properly have him.  A shiver runs through his body at the touch of your finger and he gasps for air as the sensation washes over him.  “Oh gods…. yes please….” he mutters. “Don’t stop please.”  He desperately wants to reach out and touch you to give you as much pleasure as he can but with his broken leg and burned body he’s helpless to do anything but let you work.  “I-I’m sorry I can’t…. for you.”  “it’s alright” you mutter mouthing at his side so hungry for him.  That one finger continues to stroke and tease your beloved’s cock which is twitching up into your touch. “Is this okay? Does it feel good?” You query staring up at him.  “Yesyesyes” your husband mutters breathlessly hips canting up into your touch. “It feels so good…. so good…. don’t stop please.”  That tensing in his stomach tells you he won’t last for much longer.  You know you shouldn’t tease your poor injured husband too much but you also know by now when he’s about to climax. And you really want to draw this out for him.  “Don’t cum” you plead taking your finger away. “Not yet my king.”  Aegon groans miserably; he was so close. He tries to hold himself back from the edge but it’s damn near impossible when your hand had brought him almost to the brink.  “Please” he pleads with you “I-I’m so close please don’t stop please I need….”  “I know” you mutter straining up to kiss him properly. It’s a searing kiss your lips biting into his as your slippery finger slowly circles the base of his cock avoiding his burns. “It’s going to be so good when I finally let you finish Aegon….”  He practically melts against you desperately returning your kiss. Your ministrations have slowly come to make him forget all about the pain for the first time in a long while. Everything right now is just you.  “Please” he manages to mutter between kisses. “Please I need to finish I need you so badly…. please…. please let me finish.”  You shush him yet again letting him catch his breath for a moment. “I know it’s been so long Aegon. So long since we’ve seen each other let alone touched each other. I know it’s hard for you to hold back. But can you try? For me?” A thought crosses your mind and you look worriedly at his strained face. “It doesn’t hurt does it?”  Aegon loves you and the resolute look that overtakes his face tells you he’ll try for you. “It’s alright it doesn’t hurt.”  You kiss him again sweetly knowing how hard he’s trying for you. “Thank you my love.”  Being careful not to jostle his leg you push the sheets down further and let your finger swirl delicately over the top of his thigh. “Is this okay? I know your legs have always been sensitive….”  He stifles a gasp; it’s all so much almost overwhelming his restraint.  “S-Sensitive yes but…. it’s alright. It feels good.”  Aegon’s good arm tightens around your shoulder and you bite your lip around a moan. Part of you doesn’t want Aegon to know how wet you are - he’ll see it as his duty to do something about it. And right now that’s just not possible.  “Aegon? Do you mind if I light a candle? I want to be able to see better when you spill for me.”  He’d known it would be difficult for you too like this. And unbeknownst to you he feels a small sense of satisfaction that your voice sounds just as strained as his. Even though there’s nothing he can do about it.  When you ask about the candle he nods. “Y-yes go ahead….” he says between breaths a flush of heat across his unmarred skin.  With another quick kiss you dart off the bed fumbling with the matches on the night stand. The series of half-melted candles finally lit you turn back to the bed but are stopped by Aegon’s uninjured arm his hand planted firmly on your stomach.  “Aegon…?”  “Pull your gown up” he croaks.  You shake your head trying to press past his grasp but Aegon is still surprisingly strong. “Please” he gasps tugging at the loose material around your thighs.  Acquiescing to his request you tug the folds of your dress up and rest a knee at the side of the bed letting Aegon reach under with curious fingers.  Your undergarments are soaked when he presses his hand against them and you whimper grabbing for him to steady yourself.  “There it is” he moans a satisfied smile plain on his face. “So you do still desire me….”  “Of course I do Aegon…. how could I not? Every day without you is like a knife to the heart. My ladies’ maids urge me to bring a serving boy in to help satisfy me but they don’t know…. they don’t know you’re the only one who has ever been able to.”  His fingers continue their journey between your thighs running along your sensitive center. The feel of you only serves to make him harder.  “And you don’t know” he gasps “how much the thought of you being…. with someone else nearly kills me…. you are mine.”  “I’m yours Aegon. I wouldn’t ever have asked anyone to share our bed with me. Ever.” Desperate now to be rid of your clothes you rip yourself out of them tearing the seams of your gown in your hurry.  Nonplussed you bring Aegon’s warm fingers back to your dripping cunt letting him touch to his heart’s content.  Aegon cups his hand underneath of you fingers slipping wetly through your swollen sensitive folds.  “Every night” you tell him voice trembling. “Every night I’m like this for you. I’ve missed you so….”  Aegon looks tortured the tips of his fingers seeking that tight leaking hole. Slowly two digits begin to work their way inside of you. “So tight my love. So tight without me stretching you out every night aren’t you?”  You sob fingers clenched painfully hard in the covers as you struggle to stay upright. One foot is still on the cool stone floor your other leg stretched out beside him on the bed so he can continue to finger you. “Yes Aegon! it’s actually quite…. a struggle now to take your fingers.”  “I’ll be gentle then….” He keeps those digits working slowly inside of you just stroking at your insides to get you used to him.  “Thank you Aegon….” Having not forgotten about him you steady yourself better with one leg on the bed and lean over to take Aegon’s oily cock in hand properly now stroking him lovingly.  At your touch Aegon inhales sharply. His free hand comes to grip the pillows behind his head as your hand moves over him. “Ah darling I’m trying to…. stay mmh focused on you…. but you’re making it so difficult….”  With your clean hand you stroke his hair messy against the pillows. “You don’t have to focus on me Aegon. This was supposed to be for you. My poor boy….” You sigh gaze roving over his injuries.  “But I want to please you too….” He protests although the words are almost lost in the moan he lets out after body jerking with pleasure.  He gazes up at you as you comb your hand through his hair fingers stuttering inside of you. “I-I’m still your sweet boy?” He gasps.  “The sweetest boy” you can’t help but respond twisting your hand around his fat leaking head. “If you just…. keep your hand there Aegon I can….”  With his wrist against the bed his fingers still pointed up into you you start to roll your hips effectively fucking yourself on his fingers. “I can’t wait to do this to your cock. W-When you’re a bit more healed I’ll come in here and bounce on you until we both cum okay?”  Aegon’s eyes are nearly black with desire as he digs his toes into the sheets and starts to cum. His orgasm blindsides him and he cries out letting you work your hips over his hand as his cock begins to spurt all over your fingers and his own stomach.  “That’s it my king…. let it all out. Let me milk all of it out of you…. you’ve been pent up for so long haven’t you?”  “Ye-es” Aegon chokes and as the last rope of his cum hits your wrist you fall into your own climax as well.  Cunt spasming around his fingers you brace yourself over him clutching whatever unmarred parts of him you can reach. “Aegon! Oh Aegon…. Gods you’re doing such a good job…. ”  Aegon’s fingers move slowly coaxing you through it as his chest heaves. His heart is still pounding with the pleasure of his orgasm taking in the gorgeous sight of you climaxing above him.  “You are so beautiful my queen” he mutters looking at you with desire in his eyes and a hint of pleading. “…. can I ask for something?”  Panting with exertion you turn your face toward him still grinding your orgasming cunt down against Aegon’s thick fingers. “Anything my king.”  His body is exhausted but there is one thing he wants more than anything in that moment. He needs to feel you against him skin to skin.  “I….” he starts breathlessly. “I want you to lay down. Right here right beside me. I…. I need to feel you against me.”  Pulling yourself free from his fingers you whine at the loss but do as he’s requested. Laying down beside him tugging the sheets over both of you sweaty and covered in the essence of each other.  “Did that hurt at all my love?” You mutter kissing along his shoulder. “Was it okay?”  Aegon’s eyes flutter as he feels your lips against him again. Feeling your body pressed against his and just knowing you’re there brings him more comfort than he can say.  He reaches out with his uninjured arm pulling you harder into him as he buries his face in your hair against your neck.  “No it didn’t hurt my love. It was perfect it was more than okay.”  Out in the hall hurrying footsteps make themselves known just outside the door. The knob rattles but you had locked it behind you when you entered.  “My lord” comes the head maester’s voice. “I heard you cry out. Are you alright? Are you in pain?”  Aegon just manages to hold back an annoyed laugh. Of course they had heard the two of you it’s a miracle the whole damn keep didn’t. His entire body sags in irritation and he tightens his grip on you pulling you flush against him. He damn well isn’t letting go of you just yet.  “I’m fine Archmaester. Just a…. a bit of a twinge in my leg. Nothing to be concerned about.”  You giggle muffling the sound against Aegon’s skin. “Should I let him in?”  “Absolutely not” he mutters pressing a kiss to your forehead. “You’re mine and you’re not leaving this bed and you’re not letting anyone else in this room for a long time.”,2024-07-12 21:52:28 GMT

'hotd meta'  'hotd fandom critical'  'hotd leaks'  'hotd spoilers'],ride-thedragon,Because I’m seeing the discourse pop up. Fake Rhaena enjoyers do not have a valued opinion when it comes to the leak about her and Nettles.   “Rhaena gets a bigger plot.” Rhaena is literally a beckon of hope for her house by the end the only dragonrider with her dragon of house Targaryen by the end. She has the entire Vale plot which  as Rhaenyra thinks Tyraxes isn’t enough could easily be her playing the game of thrones and forming a close alliance and meeting her future husband.   “She deserves a dragon.” She has one. It’s one of the prettiest dragons in ASOIAF history. One that matches with her sisters.  “Nettles’ plot points can be transferred.” They can’t. It’s the worst part of the rumour and people acting as though they care about either characters. It’s literally impossible for the characters because of how different they are. Neither of their plots can be transferred one to one. Rhaena is a Sansa parallel in the Narrative Nettles is Daenerys’.  “It stops this conflict.” Any conflict in this instance with these two is point of the story. Their conflicts are there for a reason.  “Rhaena can still get Morning” Then WHAT WAS THE FUCKING POINT???? That’s actually insane. What would be the point?  To those people who say Rhaena is black she isn’t. I’ll link the multiple post as to why:  Here  And here  And Nettles specifically.  The bottom line is that Rhaena is Valyrian. She isn’t black within the written narrative even though her actor is. The way these two gentlemen are black she isn’t.   If she takes Nettles’ place it’s racism.   So you fake Rhaena enjoyers who probably have a Daemon daughter oc to revoke her in your canon who can go on for hours about Daemon and the Velaryon boys without one post about his actual children and who hate Laena for no reason can disrespectfully sit this one out. This change doesn’t affect you or your enjoyment.   Let’s not act as though the Nettles replacement theory doesn’t predate Rhaena’s introduction as a character on the show.  Either all the final girls are on screen or the point of the adaptation is lost before it can establish itself.,2024-07-12 21:08:19 GMT

They’re cardboard cutout dialogue delivery machines they do what the story requires of them at any given moment and then evaporate into thin air. Their actions aren’t internally consistent to a person with a mind and opinions and emotions of their own the explanation for why they do the things they do nine times out of ten boils down to “they had to hit X point on the skeleton chart of plots beat that needed to be fulfilled” with all the moments in between being “the writers wanted them to” people aren’t always objectively consistent but they are INTERNALLY consistent and it’s why these characters don’t feel like people they’re not and the writers aren’t interested in making us BELIEVE they are they’re interested in seeing them do what they want when they want it while checking off just enough requirements to still have HBO release it. If there is ever a frustration an incoherence a simple why about the choices made and narrative created nine times out of ten this is going to be your answer. Not only is looking for something deeper or better going to drive you insane either from frustration or powerlessness (trust me I’ve been there) the people in charge are relying on us to do so it’s why this fandom was the perfect place to be so self indulgent and egotistical we’ve been trained by the creator for twenty-odd years to believe there’s always a bigger scheme and grander plans. Not this time not here. And when people recognize this is the answer there’s no wild goose chase protecting the creators anymore there’s just criticism and the consequences of their own self indulgence and ego. Don’t drive yourself crazy looking for answers drive them crazy by demanding explanations.,2024-07-12 22:23:24 GMT

Also seeing Matt Smith playing such a dark character is fascinating to me. I’ll admit I haven’t seen him in anything other than Doctor Who. Most of the time I’m able to see Daemon as just Daemon but there’s this very specific tone that Matt Smith uses for righteous fury that I associate quite strongly with the Eleventh Doctor and every once in a while Smith will use it while playing Daemon. Especially when Daemon is emphatically making a case to do something that the Doctor would use that exact same righteous-fury tone to argue against. And it makes me think of that time Matt Smith said he’d be interested in returning to Doctor Who as The Master and how incredible he could be in that role.,2024-07-12 23:53:45 GMT

Born on Dragonstone to the prince and princess. An active and energetic boy but an angel who adores his family. Especially beloved of his aunt Rhaena who calls him ‘my little shadow’. Named for the conciliator his father desires to emulate. Comes to ride Caraxes upon Daemon’s death.   Princess Rhaenys Targaryen  Born three years after her older brother their third child and second daughter. Born on Driftmark while the couple were on a visit. Her mother in miniature an impulsive and curious princess. A lover of adventure and of dragons her grandsire’s favourite grandchild. Named for her lady great-grandmother who meant so much to her parents. Comes to ride Meleys as a teenager.  Prince Lucerys Targaryen &amp; Princess Laena Targaryen  The surprises of the family born after a tragic miscarriage a year before they came born three years after Rhaenys.

The favoured sibling of her younger sister. Alyssa eventually inherits Dreamfyre.  Princess Daenerys Targaryen  Born three years later Daenerys is the sweetheart of her family. Daenerys’ birth was a difficult one for the queen who had to give birth on Dragonstone without her husband’s help. But little Daenerys came into the world perfectly healthy. Not named after anyone in particular just a name they liked. Daenerys inherits Moondancer.   Prince Corlys Targaryen  Born two years later the final son of the king and queen. Corlys is the best swordsman of his brothers training under his father and mother from a young age. Born in King’s Landing with only his parents and a few maids in attendance.

That’s what they called him. Rejoicing in celebration as his brother patted him on the back after Vhagar mercilessly killed Arrax and Lucereys Targaryen. His nephew his kin. Aegon looked…proud? Alicent shaking her head as she makes her way to her chambers unable to look at him. His grandsire looked as though he was about to faint right that instant.   He didn’t mean to. He didn’t want to. He was just…  Just what?   There was no simple explanation to why he acted the way he did tonight on Storm’s End. He was angry furious even. But he a man who is the perfect picture of composure let his emotions get the worst of him. He was only trying to scare him with Vhagar a dragon that chose him. Vhagar chose him that night a dragon known for its great size and strength all over the Seven Kingdoms.   He should be celebrating with his brother; who called for a celebration a feast in Aemond’s name.   Kinslayer.   Kinslayer  Kinslayer.  Kin-  Soft thumbs invaded his hands plotting a coup and attacking their way into his palms a finger then another weaving through his hand and shooting pints of blood to his heart that thrummed erratically through his chest. He could feel it in his bones.   He took a breath then another.   In….hold…out.   He tensed his feet trying to dig them into the concrete ground of the grand hall. Drowning in the cold noises of the feast.   He doesn’t say anything or meet her eyes. Fearing what she might hold in them. Fear? Disappointment? Distaste? Does she see him as a monster now that he’s betrayed one of his own?   He never liked Lucereys but he knows she did. Oh even the sevens know how much she loves those boys ever since they were kids. She never held any distaste towards his nephews or his siblings. He never liked them but he loves her. God he loves her.   They don’t say anything to each other. Not for the rest of night. She keeps a hold of his hand squeezing it once pausing then two and three. A secret language- a code.   I still love you.   He kisses her forehead that night not a single word uttered even then his lips lingering as he cradles her head. Ever so carefully like she’s porcelain breaking at any given moment. Pulling her into his chest as he feels her tears escape onto his chest. Silent sobs and his heart chips and eats him from the inside not wanting him to see the next sunrise. But he stays still he stays because he knows he’s at fault. And she stays too. Her arms like ivy curling into him as he hugs her- squeezes her once then again.   I’m sorry.,2024-07-12 23:08:21 GMT

Also seeing Matt Smith playing such a dark character is fascinating to me. I’ll admit I haven’t seen him in anything other than Doctor Who. Most of the time I’m able to see Daemon as just Daemon but there’s this very specific tone that Matt Smith uses for righteous fury that I associate quite strongly with the Eleventh Doctor and every once in a while Smith will use it while playing Daemon. Especially when Daemon is emphatically making a case to do something that the Doctor would use that exact same righteous-fury tone to argue against. And it makes me think of that time Matt Smith said he’d be interested in returning to Doctor Who as The Master and how incredible he could be in that role.,2024-07-12 23:53:45 GMT

0,House of the Dragon,['nielsen'  'streaming ratings'  'the resident'],frazzledsoul,Delayed Nielsen streaming ratings are out for June 10-16. Bridgerton rules all with 3.4 billion minutes viewed (those are huge numbers for streaming). Nothing else of note here except that House of the Dragon just missed the Top 10 on its first night back with 741 million minutes viewed. We’ll see how it shapes up once there’s a full week to view.  I haven’t kept up with this lately because none of stuff that charted really interested me. Matt Czuchry’s medical drama The Resident charted about seven total weeks as opposed to four for This Is Us so I guess he won the Battle of the Gilmore Girls Boyfriends.,2024-07-13 01:36:35 GMT

The men refused to listen to the women and only looked alert when another man addressed them. But at the same time I’m still glad this show finally allowed Corlys to be taken seriously by his fellow nobles.  In season one there were some instances of the other nobles addressing Corlys in a dismissive manner. In the bts material it was even said that the nobles look down on Corlys. So yes the bar is literally on the ground but I’m still accepting this as a small victory.  Although I do find it annoying that it’s only halfway through the season that he finally attends a council meeting. Because in all the previous episodes this season whenever the Black council meets Corlys is conspicuously absent. He’s supposed to be a prominent member of that council even before he gets named Hand of the Queen. You can’t expect me to believe that he’s just been spending all his time either at the shipyards or in bed. The show could have featured Corlys in those other council scenes at Dragonstone. Once again these writers’ intentions to reduce Corlys’ capability as a competent politician is on display.,2024-07-13 01:31:11 GMT

Her…father had flown back to Pentos with his family a fortnight after her name day. Most of his time in Kings Landing had been spent trying to gain her attention. Much to his dismay she had ignored him and only spoken to him no more than four sentences at most. She stared at the dagger he had the blacksmith of the castle make.  “Valyrian steel. It was a gift from my father when I turned 11. I had the smith change the hilt to something more feminine. ”  The once black hilt was now inlaid with gleaming sapphires all of different sizes. It had been a marvelous gift if only the giver had been someone she actually liked. She had quietly murmured her thanks to him and then watched as he walked off to join his wife.  “If you don’t like it I’ll take it.” Aemond said  “You are mad if you think I’ll give my Valyrian steel to you.” She said  “I’m just saying…if you decide it is ugly I will take good care of it.” He shrugs  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Rhaella sighs. Aemond had been getting rather bold. When she asked Edric he had said it was apart of what boys did when they grew up. She wasn’t entirely sure she wanted Aemond to grow up. Sure she was already a year older than him and his 10th name day had been many weeks ago. All she knew was that once you became old you had responsibilities. Responsibilities that would keep them from seeing each other daily the way they did now.  “I thought you wanted to practice your Valyrian? Isn’t that why we are in the Godswood because it is quiet?” Aemond asked  “We are in the Godswood because you complained my room was boring and yours too stuffy for studying.” She reminded him  “Iykirī.” Aemond says to her rising tone  Calm down  “I am calm kirimvose.” She says a mocking tone dripping at the end of her sentence  Thank you  Aemond rolls his eyes and goes back to attempting to translate. Rhaella’s eyes fall to the bright yellow wildflowers growing next to her. Aemond’s hair catches her eye as it practically glitters in the sun. He has elected to leave it out of its normal half-up style and Rhaella has found it mesmerizing.  “You are staring again.” He says  “Your hair looks amazing today.” She compliments  “I need to cut it. It is annoying me.” He says his ears turning red at her praise  “I quite like long the longer hair on you.” She says picking a flower  “You do?” Aemond asks  “Of course. It reminds me of my own. Not to mention I am sure ladies of the court will love it.” She says  “I do not care what ladies of the court think of me.” Aemond dismisses  “I am a lady of the court. Do you not care what I think?” She teases  “That is entirely different…” Aemond says  “It is not.” She laughs  “It is.” He says  The days in Kings Landing had grown repetitive for Rhaella. Rhaenrya’s family had moved to Dragonstone three moons ago. Rhaella never understood why they had to leave just that they did. She missed the ever-mischievous Jacaerys and Lucerys and the pranks they’d play on Aemond and even Aegon on occasion.  Now her days were long filled with lessons and needlework. After Rhaenrya had left Ser Harwin had returned to his home at Harrenhal after an issue with Ser Criston. Queen Alicent had elected to stop Rhaella’s sword training and now she spent her days with Helaena hoping Aemond would come find her after his own training. Of course the most shocking part of it all was Ser Harwin and his father’s death in a terrible fire Rhaella could hardly believe she’d never be able to see the muscly curly-headed man again.  “My prince My lady.” A handmaiden interrupted their “studying” “The queen summons both of you to her chamber. It is urgent.”  Rhaella was never entirely sure what to think of Queen Alicent. Sure she was beautiful and graceful and Rhaella liked her curly hair. But her countenance had always been a bit drawn to her. Perhaps it was because she was Daemon’s child. It was no secret that the queen did not like her husband’s brother. Of course Rhaella didn’t even like the kings brother…  Driftmark was beautiful. Even the sadness of Lady Laena’s death could not dampen the ocean’s beauty. Seagull’s voice’s drowned out the voice of Vaemond Velaryon as he spoke of salt in Velaryon’s blood.  Rhaella looked at Baela and Rhaena who were standing close to their grandmother. She felt a twinge of sadness as she watched her half-sisters cry life without a mother was hard. She of course had no memories of her own but still life would have been easier had Lady Rhea lived.  The solemnness of the whole ordeal was broken when Daemon laughed. Rhaella could not understand what might have been funny at this moment. Surely he was sad that his wife had died along with what would have been their third child together.  Rhaella watched Daemon sip his wine. He was entirely alone staring at the open water while many congregated and gave condolences to Princess Rhaenys and Lord Corlys. She supposed she should offer her sorrows to him Queen Alicent said that it was the proper thing to say to those who have lost a loved one.  “Mother has engaged Aegon and Heleana” Aemond said suddenly coming up to her  “I am aware. My handmaid told me a week ago.” She said  “He does not even want her though.” Aemond said  He seemed almost upset. Surely Aemond did not love Heleana like that…Edric had always said husbands and wives had different love than that of siblings.  “You wish to marry her?” Rhaella asked ignoring the tightening in her stomach at the idea. She wasn’t even sure why she felt like this Aemond was free to marry whoever he wished he was a prince.  “I would do my duty.” Aemond said “ I just do not think Aegon deserves her.”  Rhaella had to cover her mouth at his statement. As far as she was concerned Aegon didn’t deserve any noble lady as a wife. Whispers of his activities flowed through the Red Keep like water.  “Do you want to walk along the coast line with me? I want to bring seashells home for my room.” Aemond said  Rhaella wanted to accept surely seashell hunting would be more enjoyable. Yet she felt drawn to staying as he eyes fell on Baela who had an arm around her sister.  “Perhaps later.” She said before walking away  “Lady Rhaella.” Baela greeted getting ready to stand  “Do not trouble yourself. I wanted to offer my sorrows and…prayers for your mother.” Rhaella said awkwardly she wished she was better at starting conversations. It had been over a year since she left the isolation of Runestone and yet her social skills were still subpar.  “Thank you” Baela said  Rhaena did not speak but offered a small sad smile.  Cool wind pushes her hair off her shoulders and stings her skin. Aemond is staring at her from the spot she left him at. His face seems to beg her to come back to save him from Aegon who is now talking his ears off.  “Have you spoken to our father?” Rhaena asked suddenly  She did not want to not after the disastrous name day celebration.  “I have not.” She said  “Perhaps she does not wish to speak to him Rhaena.” Baela scolded her sister  “I was just asking.” Rhaena sighed  “I do not know how to speak to him. Anytime I look at him it is like my throat closes up.” Rhaella said sadly “I don’t think he likes me.”  Many hours later Rhaella is awoken by Baela above her shaking her shoulders.  “It is the middle of the night.” She groaned scolding her younger half-sister “We can speak of Daemon tomorrow.”  “This isn’t about Daemon.” Jacaery’s voice says  Rhaella wants to bury her head under the blankets and never return. They were only a few years younger than her why were they all so annoying? All she wants is to sleep.  “Someone has stolen Vhagar!” Baela whispers  Vhagar? Her mother’s dragon? Who could steal a beast like that?  She rolls out of bed nearly tripping on her blankets while her cousins and half-sisters have already dashed out the door. Perhaps they’d be lucky and Vhagar had just chosen to go for a midnight flight dragons were mysterious creatures to her.  Loud shouts were echoing as she ran after them. What could they possibly be doing? When she finally reaches the long hall where they had stopped her eyes widened. Jace Luke Baela and Rhaena were all kicking and punching Aemond of all people. Her closest friend was on his back with his arms protecting his face.  “What are you all doing?” She yelled running to pull Jacaerys away  “He stole our mother’s dragon!” Baela said pausing her kicking to point at Aemond  “She was mine to claim. Not yours!” Rhaena said  “As I said you should have claimed her. She is mine now.” Aemond said from his spot on the ground  Rhaella isn’t sure what to think. She could barely wrap her head around what was happening. Aemond had claimed a dragon and the biggest living one at that.  “Jace can find you a pig to ride” Aemond says mockingly to Rhaena  “Stop!” Rhaella yells when her half-sisters resume their hitting and Jace wiggles out of her arms to join them and his little brother.  It all happens so fast Aemond who is bigger than everyone except her quickly overpowers their younger relatives. He throws Rhaena and Baela off him with ease and sends a hard punch to Jacaerys’ face. It is only when the smallest Lucerys has his neck being grasped by Aemond that her feet seem to work again.  “Aemond. Stop this madness” She commanded pulling at his hand around the little boys neck that refused to budge  Despite her slight height advantage Aemond was determined and Rhaella found herself unable to move him.  Perhaps it is the adrenaline of it all claiming a dragon being beaten by your cousins but Aemond spares her no more than a hard gaze before taking his spare hand and punching her directly in the nose.  It is like she has forgotten every lesson Ser Hawin ever taught as warm blood flows freely down her face and into the dirt she landed in. Her eyes water from the suddeness of it all and perhaps the pain that came with the impact of his fist.  “You will die screaming in flames just as your father did. Bastards.” Aemond says holding a large rock over Lucery’s head.  “My father is alive.” He wails  “He doesn’t know does he Lord Strong?” Aemond mocks questioning their cousin’s birthright.  Rhaella feels her heart drop to her feet when she sees Jace pull a small knife from its scabbard.  “Jace!” Baela calls  Rhaella’s head turns as she looks at her half-sisters next to her. She grabs Baela’s hand and squeezes tightly ignoring how her nose bleeds. She wants to get up and stop them yet fear and dizziness from Aemond’s hand keep her on the ground.  Aemond uses his size against Jace and raises the rock again this time meaning to being it down on his head. A handful of dust is thrown at her friend and a bit of it gets in her own eyes as pained screams fill the air. What has happened?  She rubs the dirt out of her eyes and sees Aemond on the ground clutching at his face. Deep red stains the dirt below him as he yells. Rhaella glances at the blade which is still clutched in Lucery’s hand.  “Aemond!” She gasps abandoning Baela to kneel next to him “Aemond move your hand I cannot help you if you do not…”  Aemond’s blood mixes with hers on her hands as she tries to look at the wound while he continues to wail. She moves his head into her lap and brushes away the silver hair that is sticking to his face and becoming slick with blood. Perhaps she could tear a bit of her night dress off to stop the bleeding. Then she’d help him back to the castle and find a Maester.  “Cease this at once!” Ser Harrold’s voice fills her ears “Move away.”  His arms lift her away from Aemond who is still clutching at his face. She cannot see what the wound looks like from behind Ser Harrold but she can hear his gasp.  “God’s be good.”  Aemond’s eye is gone forever. Rhaella is sure of it as she watches Driftmark’s Maester slowly stitch his skin together. Queen Alicent sits next to Aemond holding his hand while he squirms each time the needle touches his skin.  “The eye is lost Your Grace.” the Maester confirms her suspicions.  “I will have answers as to what happened” Viserys says clearly angry  Rhaella did not expect everyone to begin speaking at once. Rhaena and Baela are pointing and shouting at Aemond while Jace argues directly with Aemond despite Rhaenrya holding his arms. She isn’t sure what to say or if her voice will even be heard. Instead she lets her eyes scan the room where they land on Daemon. Her father leans on the door and watches the scene unfold the way she is. His eyes meet hers and she can tell he is taking in her appearance. Surely she is still covered in blood from her nose which has thankfully stopped its bleeding.  “Enough!” the king’s voice silences everyone “I want the truth.”  “What more is there? Your son has been maimed” Alicent says “Her sons are responsible. Prince Lucerys brought a blade to the fight he meant to kill my son.”  That was a lie the blade was never Luke’s and Rhaella was sure her cousins didn’t mean to kill.  “My sons were attacked and forced to defend themselves.” Rhaenrya says stepping in front of her sons “Vile insults were said about them.”  “What insults?” Viserys tiredly asked  “The legitimacy of their birth” Rhaenrya said  The room fell silent as Rhaenrya addressed the rumors that had swirled around her family for so many years. Rhaella remembered the first time she had heard people muttering that Jace and Luke were bastards. Perhaps it was true they looked nothing like Ser Laenor yet Rhaella did not see why it mattered. Laenor had always seemed like a wonderful father to them.  “He called us bastards” Jace said stepping from behind Rhaenrya to address the king.  Rhaella peers around Alicent who is blocking her view of Aemond. She is surprised to see a small smirk on his lips.  “This is treason. My sons are in line for the Iron Throne. Aemond must be questioned to learn where he heard these words.” Rhaenrya says.  “My son has lost an eye.” Alicent says  “Aemond. Where did you hear these lies?” Viserys asks  A long pause ensues and her friend does not speak.  Only the crackle of the fire is heard as Aemond opens his mouth.  “It was Aegon.”  Rhaella along with everyone else turns to stare at the older boy.  “Me?” He breathes clearly not expecting to be involved in it all.  “Where did you hear of them?” Viserys asks walking to him.  Aegon avoids eye contact with his father and stares ahead a decision that didn’t seem smart to Rhaella.  “Aegon! Tell me the truth of it!” Viserys suddenly yells making Rhaella jump  “We know father. Everyone knows…Just look at them.” Aegon says slowly glancing over.  Rhaella looks at her younger cousins whose brown hair looks even darker than normal in the poorly lit room. The lack of the Valyrian features on their faces was plain as day.  “And you?”  Rhaella suddenly feels eyes on her.  “What did you see?” Viserys asks walking towards her cane thumping being the only noise.  “I…was a few moments behind Baela and Rhaena. When I arrived they were kicking and punching Prince Aemond who was on the ground.” Rhaella says trying not to stutter “He pushed them all off and then insulted Jace and Luke while holding a rock above their heads.”  She glances around the room and finds Daemon staring at her a look of interest is on his face as she continues.  “I tried to stop him from strangling Luke but Aemond hit me and then the blade was brought out and he…was cut by one of my cousins.” Rhaella says  “Lucerys cut him. He took my son’s eye Viserys.” Alicent says  Viserys looks down at Rhaella who meets his eyes.  “This interminable fighting must cease! All of you!” Viserys suddenly yells turning to face everyone once more “We are family…make your apologies and show goodwill towards one another.”  Surely that cannot be it? Rhaella cannot belive what is happening. She expected more an insult like the one Aemond said was surely worth a punishment not that she wanted to see him punished…she just knew what he said had been wrong even if his eye was gone because of it.  “There is a debt to be paid.” Alicent says  Rhaella looks at the queen. Tears are in her eyes yet Rhaella does not detect any sadness on her face.  “Do not allow temper to cloud your vision” Viserys says to his wife  The king begins to walk away as Alicent speaks again.  “If the king does not seek justice the queen will. Ser Criston bring me the eye of Lucerys Velyaron he may choose which eye he can keep a pleasure he did not give my son.”  “You will do no such thing” Rhaenrya sharply says  Rhaella can feel her heart begin to race. The tension in the room is enough to drive anyone mad as the king turns around.  “Stay your hand.” He orders  “You’re sworn to me!” Alicent suddenly yells  “As your protector.” Ser Criston reminds her.  “This matter is finished.” Viserys says “Anyone whose tongue questions Princess Rhaenrya’s sons legitimacy shall have it removed.”  Rhaella looks at Aemond who avoids her gaze in turn looking at his hands which are caked in his own blood.  Chaos is the only word she could use to describe what happened next. In a flash Alicent had grabbed the king’s dagger and was grappling with Rhaenrya all for Lucery’s eye.  Rhaella stumbles back as Ser Harold rushes into the fray barking orders at Ser Criston. Lucerys’ loud screams are what reach her ears as Rhaenrya and Alicent have their exchange.  “Exhausting isn’t it? Hiding beneath the cloak of your own righteousness?” Rhaenrya’s voice sends a chill down Rhaella’s spine “But now they see you as you are.”  The blade makes a cut swift and unforgiving as Alicent and Rhaenrya quickly move away from each other. Rhaella gasps when she sees Rhaenrya’s blood trickle onto the floor.  Aemond finally rises from his spot and he looks at her for just a second. His single eye is unreadable to her as he goes to his mother.  “It was a fair exchange.” He says “I may have lost an eye…but I gained a dragon.”  Three days later:  Packing is never something she has enjoyed. Her handmaid helps her fold her clothes neatly as if the ship will not mess them up in their journey back to Kings Landing.  “Rhaella?” A voice calls followed by a knock  “Yes?” She answers “Come in.”  Rhaena and Baela push her door open and enter her chamber.  “Our grandmother told us to come find you. She said we ought to ask and not her.” Rhaena said  “Ask me what?” She asks  “Say it.” Baela whispers  “You do it! I opened the door!” Rhaena said jabbing an elbow at her twin  “That is hardly a reason-”  Baela is cut off by Rhaena speaking again and Rhaella wants to laugh at them they are truly siblings. They quarrel the same way Jace and Luke do over food and toys.  “We wish for you to live with us. Our grandmother will be raising us and we want to know you as a sister not just a story our mother tells us before bedtime.” Rhaena says  Rhaella is stunned. She never imagined having a real relationship with them let alone living with them. It is truly all she has ever dreamed of they are the closest kin she has besides Daemon himself of course.  “What about our father…is he going to remain here?”  Rhaella does not want to interact with him regularly. How could she accept if he was always lurking in the halls?  “Our father will not remain here. We are unsure of his next move but he has already talked to us of staying here at Driftmark.” Baela says  “He may visit at times but…I believe he will be letting our grandmother raise us most of the time.” Rhaena says  Rhaella cannot tell if they are sad by this prospect. Perhaps they are not close to Daemon either. Is anyone actually close to him?  “I would have to return to Kings Landing. Most of my things are there. And my…friend Maester Edric. I want him to live with me. He has raised me as his own.” Rhaella says  “Our grandparents have already set aside a room for him. Yours is next to his.” Baela smiles  “You are both very kind as are Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys. Could you tell them I wish to think about it?” Rhaella asks  Baela and Rhaena leave with a nod of their heads off to tell their grandparents.  “Should I continue packing Lady Rhaella?” Her handmaid asks  “No I will finish it myself. Thank you.” Rhaella dismisses her she has much to think about.  Aemond’s face burns. Earlier the Maester had given him milk of the poppy and rubbed strange-smelling cream where his eye once was. His awareness has dropped he has bumped into countless things today and it was not even noon yet. They were set to return to Kings Landing today and he was going to get to fly home on Vhagar instead of sitting next to his mother on the ship.  He hasn’t seen Rhaella since the night he lost his eye he refuesed her visits despite all that has happened. He feels guilty about how he struck her after all her nose had bled so much. Aemond is still unsure of why he struck her. Was it the heat of the moment? Or had he truly meant it?  No. He’d never intentionally punch her hurting his one friend in this world was not like him. He decides to write it off as an accident in his mind as his door opens.  “Mother.”  “How are you feeling? Has the Measter given you milk of the poppy yet?” She asks  “I am fine.” He says deciding not to tell her how it feels  “Rhaella is going to remain here at Driftmark.” She says suddenly  “What?” He asks stunned.  “ I wanted her to return to her true home but your father would not have it. I asked Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys if they would look after her until she is of age to take Runestone and be married. They are already taking in your cousins. I believe it best that-”  “No!” Aemond shouts the chair toppled over as he quickly stands “She is my friend. I want her to return with us to the Red Keep.”  “I knew this attachment would be hard to break. I told your father that it was best to keep you separate and now look what it has done. You have only known her for a year and a half Aemond. And now you have been maimed and will never be whole again.” His mother says her eyes fixed on his missing one.  “It was not her fault my eye is gone. She wasn’t the one holding the blade!” Aemond argues thinking back to Lucery’s face as the blade cut him and how he struck her so that she was unable to get back up.  “Not her fault? Then why is it gone?” His mother stands to tower over him “If it wasn’t her fault she would have stopped Lucerys. Instead she sat there while you were injured permanently. ”  The firmness of his mother’s normally soft-spoken voice scares him as does the firm grip she takes on his arms slightly shaking him as she speaks again.  “She will never be on your side on your brothers. The way she looks at Rhaenrya’s bastards and Daemon she has chosen where she belongs even if she does not realize it yet. She will turn on you if you keep her close to your side. I am doing you a favor by removing her from your life.”  Aemond shakes his head unwilling to imagine what his mothers words are trying to create in his mind.  “Leave her here. Let the tides wash her away and your memories of her with them. One day you will help your brother take his throne and all will be right. She will become a problem if she remains at court with you.  Aemond looks upon his mother’s face which is hardened with determination that he see what she has said to him. His face burns as he opens his mouth and turns his eye to look directly at her.  &quot;You are wrong.”        Sorry for the lack of a chapter yesterday.

THOUGHT MITCHELL CORRECTED THE RECORD PRETTY QUICKLY ON THAT POINT.  “Not Vhagar” he said with a smile. “She’s still up there.”,2024-07-13 02:43:20 GMT

Daemon/Rhaenyra’s age-gap is close to 20 years apart. We had scenes of them with implied sexual tension even when Rhaenyra was only 14 in episode 1 yet no one seemed to have a problem with that.    Viserys/Alicent..we won’t even talk about the age-gap between these two because it’s just absurd but it is an arranged marriage. Yet again most people don’t seem to have a problem with this.   Aemond/Alys or Daemon/Alys the largest age-gap thus far considering Gayle Rankin claims that Alys is nearly 400 years old beneath her glimmer.   Lastly Aemond/Lucerys these two have the least of the age-gaps as they are only 3 years apart and yet people still call this the most “monstrous” of all the ships in show-verse. I get it Elliot who plays Luke is far younger than Ewan so the age disparity is more obvious than it should be in canon but so was Matt Smith and Milly Alcock when they portrayed Daemon/Rhaenyra…Let’s be real though the main reason people are offended by this pairing is because it’s a queer ship. Had Lucerys been a girl there wouldn’t be near as much affront. I know a lot of talented amazing individuals who have written for this ship..particularly aged-up Aemond/Lucerys and none of them deserve the hate directed towards them nor their work when there are far more disturbing ships in the show. Not everyone who supports this pairing condone fanart/works portraying the underage actor. So let’s stop acting like everyone who ships Lucerys/Aemond is demon spawn for seven hells sake. 🤝,2024-07-13 02:38:44 GMT

Princess Rhaenyra demanded to have the dragon’s head cut but as nobody ever tried nor dared to get close to the Cannibal it was impossible to do it. Thus her daughter took the matters into her own hands.  pairings: cregan stark x velaryon!reader (no use of y/n) platonic (familial) relationship between the targs/velaryon and reader  word count: 8.2k   warnings: cregan being harassed by a six year old tantrums mentions of death reader being young rhaenyra come back to life overall pretty chill?  author’s note: man do i love writing about reader annoying cregan.  previous | next | series masterlist  &lt;!-- more --&gt; You spend the month before your sixth nameday on Driftmark with your paternal grandparents and the other Velaryon family members.  There your grandparents shower you with gifts presenting you with a beautiful headpiece made of pearls and seashells that you fall in love with and a new array of clothes — all embroidered with diamonds and pearls most in the sea-blue colour of the Velaryon emblem.  “We started out as fishermen” Corlys tells you one day holding you in his arms and motioning to the vastness of the sea beyond Blackwater Bay. “Then we became sailors then explorers then merchants. Then we took what was rightfully ours– Driftmark and a title. But never forget where you came from little one. We owe the sea too much to discard it.”  You like the sea almost as much as you like riding dragons. You and your grandfather take swims together when it gets too hot taking your time to cool off before going back to the castle trying to hold in your laughter and hide from the wrath of Rhaenys who isn’t too fond of the idea of her granddaughter being wet like a dog. And since her husband isn’t getting any younger either and constantly complains about aching limbs then maybe he shouldn’t dive into Blackwater Bay like it’s a hot bath too.   When she isn’t preoccupied in reprimanding you and her husband for being childish your grandmother Rhaenys takes you on long rides on Meleys the Red Queen who has taken a liking in you and seeks your caresses every time you are near. You like the air brushing your face and hair and the enormous castle becoming almost small from how much high up you two are.   Your father and grandfather make sure to start teaching you all they know about boats and navigating through the sea. You ask them when your brothers will be able to join you all and they tell you that once they near their sixth nameday they’ll take them out to the sea too; teach them everything they know just as they’re doing with you. You cannot wait for Jace and Luke to be able to share this with you because the sea has never felt more like home than right now.   As you lean over the edge of the boat you let your hand brush over the surface of the water looking at your grandmother in complete awe. “We have to do this more often grandmother I can’t remember ever having this much fun in my life.”  She laughs then a rich sound coming right from her heart and pinches your nose eyes tender and loving. “Ah is that so my sweet? Then I’ll be expecting a lot of visits from you once you claim your own dragon.”   You perk up. “I promise the first time I fly on a dragon it will be to come here and visit you and grandfather.”  You catch your first fish that day — a little thing that could barely fill even the stomach of a child — and your grandfather takes you in his arms and promises that soon he will buy you your own boat — after all the feast for your sixth summer is only a sennight away. It’s also the first time you hold a real sword in your hands and as you almost — and by accident — cut off Corlys’ nose your father laughs his ass off and promises that soon enough he’ll start training you to be able to manage a real blow with the blade.  Two days later you all depart on dragonback for King’s Landing; and even if Corlys has always been hesitant about riding on Meleys with his wife your laughs while you sat in front of your father on Seasmoke definitely eased his nerves. It’s a relatively short ride to the Dragonpit as you leave in the morrow right after breaking your fast and by the late afternoon you’re already in the Crown Lands.   Waiting for you in the Dragonpit are your mother and the King a smile on their faces Viserys with his arms open waiting for a hug.   You get off of Seasmoke’s wing slipping like it’s some sort of slide as your father yells at you to please be careful then immediately call out for your grandsire while running up at him. “Ah my dear granddaughter!” he exclaims holding out his arms and catching you as you jump in them. He tries his best not to grunt from the effort. “Have you been good to your father Lord Corlys and Rhaenys?”  You excitedly nod snuggling into his shoulder and even if his knees and back are screaming for mercy since his health is getting worse and his muscles more frail he refuses to accept that his precious girl is growing up — so much that in a few months he won’t be able to pick her up anymore.   Rhaenyra raises an eyebrow at your apparent lack of care about her presence. “What am I chopped liver?”  You hold out a hand and pat it against her shoulder almost like you’re saying sorry. You still don’t budge from your grandsire’s arms. She doesn’t seem to hold it against you taking your little palm in hers and placing a kiss on it. She brushes your hair out of your face as you close your eyes yawning.   She chuckles. “Tired my love?”   You nod eyes teary from the sleepiness. Your mother then eases you out of your grandsire’s arms without too many protests holding you close against her chest. “Then we better go to bed as soon as we get back to the Keep sweetling.”  It seems you don’t like this idea. “Don’ wanna” you mumble barely squirming not even managing to formulate properly a sentence. “I wanna play with Jace and Luke and and… and train with them and dad. Grandma says she’s goin’ to teach me how to sew dresses for Emya and Melissa like auntie Helaena does and grandpa wants to take me with him to sail across the seas.”  Emya and Melissa are your favourite dolls — just two of the dozens you have the ones you gift to all the outfits Helaena sews for practice. Soon enough she’ll have to start learning how to do that too your mother thinks not without a pang of sadness in her heart. How time flies. “You’ll have time to sail with Corlys and learn from Rhaenys how to sew once you get older sweetling. About your father and your brothers… well they aren’t going anywhere any time soon.”   She isn’t surprised to see you pass out in her arms not even a few minutes later and by the time the carriage stops at the Keep you’re dead asleep. She lays you in your bed and tucks you in for the night thinking– My little girl soon enough will be a big girl. But then she ponders that you could never be too big for her to stop considering you her little girl.   The next day is spent catching up with your brothers; mostly Luke who apparently took your absence particularly bad and is now set on always having at least a hand on you — and that is when he doesn’t straight up wrap his body around one of your legs hence you having to limp through the Red Keep with your little brother chained to your leg.   Thankfully Rhaenys is quick to put an end to this madness demanding the prince to stop harassing you since you’re not going anywhere for a while. Lucerys departs from your leg — not without any protests — and lets you be even if in the next few days he’s still pretty clingy — not that you would ever mind. He’s still your little brother and you give him all the hugs and cuddles he wants even if sometimes you’d rather be by yourself or with just Heleana without getting interrupted every single minute.   When you bring it up to her she shrugs. “I would pay to have brothers like that you know. Be thankful for what you have.” Because my brothers are too stuck in their own misery to even care about me or notice my presence or absence.  You take her hand and squeeze it then hug her tight. “But you have me” you reply. “‘Tis not much maybe but I can try.” Helaena only shakily hugs you back not saying anything. She usually doesn’t like hugs but this one feels strangely comforting.   (You don’t know how much she cried that night thinking about how she wishes you were her sister and not a niece her mother despises. But it’s probably better this way because maybe if you were born as her sister you wouldn’t be as loved as you are — and she can’t even imagine you being in her situation always discarded by your family. Maybe you would become as careless as Aegon or as closed off as Aemond. Maybe it’s a blessing you weren’t borne out of Alicent Hightower.   Then she prays that in another lifetime you two are borne out of the same mother a mother as loving as Rhaenyra and she gets to be your older sister without having to ask anyone for permission to have a hug from you.)  The day of your name day finally arrives and with it the feast your grandsire has organised in the last two months. It is a grand affair with almost all the lords from the Seven Kingdoms present and your parents honestly have no idea where they’re going to put all the gifts you’ll receive.   You sit right beside your grandsire between him and your mother wearing the pearl headpiece your grandparents gifted you and an aqua blue dress that has been tailor made for the occasion. Every now and then a Lord gets up from his table to bring their felicitations to you and your family but you know it’s just a way to somehow get to talk to your grandsire about their matters.  Most of them are old and boring and Viserys dismisses them without even a spare glance towards their problems set on having a good time at least during your celebrations. You don’t pay them much mind either focused on the food and all the gifts that you’ll get to unwrap in the next few days — that is until a guy more or less of Aemond’s age comes over.   The first thing Rhaenyra does — after thinking what the hell do they feed children in the North for them to be this big? — is nudging her husband on the ribs and nodding towards the boy. “Looks like he got a new buckle. Let’s hope she doesn’t steal that one too.”  He’s grown since the last time she’s seen him. He should be ten maybe eleven summers old now but looks a bit older — northerners and their fucking genes. His dark hair is shorter he has a ceremonial dagger strapped on his belt and this time he definitely looks like a Little Lord.   “My King” he bows then nods to you and bows again. “My Princess I wished to congratulate you on your sixth nameday and excuse my father for his absence. Unfortunately he fell ill just before the departure to King’s Landing so he sent me in his stead.“ He raises his head and looks again at you “To a hundred of these days my Princess.”  You’ve got the same look you had when you first saw him as a babe even if Rhaenyra is sure that you don’t remember even seeing him. She isn’t even sure you know who he is but you’re already blushing and swinging your legs under the table.   “Ah you’re Lord Rickon’s son– Cregan am I right?” Viserys looks over to his daughter for confirmation and she nods. The boy nods too. “Yes Your Majesty. Unfortunately he had to stay in the North.”   “Yes yes ‘tis no problem” Viserys waves a hand at him “Send him my regards. Last year your mother died — and so did your brother the year before am I right? Another tragedy in the North is the last thing we want.” he grimaces at his bad phrasing which clearly sounded better in his head. The boy doesn’t react but he knows that if he wasn’t the King he probably would already have that beautiful ceremonial knife up his throat.   Rhaenyra coughs. “What the King means to say” she interjects “is that we wish you our deepest condolences and will pray so that Lord Rickon can get a fast recovery.”   Cregan bows his head and half-smiles. “Thank you my Princess.”   “Is it as cold in the North as they say?” you suddenly ask him tone full of child-like awe.   The boy winces and Rhaenyra just knows he’s getting flashbacks of that one time when you tried to make him bald. “Erm… yes it is. There’s snow all year.”   “One day I’ll make sure to bring you there” your grandsire briefly cuts in not wanting to bother the Little Lord any longer. He smiles at him nodding “I hope you enjoy the rest of the evening boy.”  Cregan doesn’t have to be told twice because by the time he’s finished bowing he’s already sprinting to the table he left earlier. You pout staring at him while he sits back down between some other northern lords and you hear your mother laugh. “Why the long face sweetling?”  You look up at her. “Is the North far away?” you do have geography lessons but something like distance is still a pretty hard concept to understand.   Rhaenyra raises an eyebrow amused. “The North or where the boy comes from?” You blush and keep your head down “Why where the boy comes from of course”  Your mother laughs. “I’d say that Winterfell is… maybe a little more than a moon by carriage far from here.” your face falls “But it’s a day or two by dragon.”   You perk up. “When can I claim Merrax?”  Rhaenyra almost falls out of the chair laughing at this. It seems that the first love is never truly forgotten even if you don’t even remember him. “Soon enough sweetling.”   Not much long after the bards pick songs you can dance to; your grandsire offers you his hand to open the dances even if he isn’t in the best conditions to do so and you gleefully accept. You share a dance with him even if it has to be cut short because of him not feeling the best and happily swap him for your grandparents who like to twirl you around until you’re dizzy.   You can’t even sit down before your brothers grab your hands and drag you to the dancefloor once again demanding a dance with their sister too and it’s only when the bards choose a slower song that you finally manage to sit down and catch a breath. That is until you see the boy.   Cregan Stark is about to retire for the night when he catches the scare of his life.   “I have a buckle like that too.”  He barely manages to hold back a yelp eyes snapping behind him just to see you bashfully looking at him hands behind your back and on your tiptoes. He presses a hand on his chest regaining himself. “Princess” he says but it sounds a bit breathless. “Yes I remember. I gave you that buckle six years ago.”   You tilt your head. “Ah really?”  He nods. “Yes at the feast for your birth. I remember it well.” I also remember how you terrorised me for a good part of the night.   You hum but don’t seem to have anything to say for now. He feels awkward because he would gladly take his leave right now if it weren’t for the fact that he can feel the eyes of the whole Royal Family on you two. He’s not sure he can go without having the permission to — your permission maybe — and the only thing his father advised him not to do was to cause a diplomatic incident.   (Meanwhile at the Royal table your grandfathers and Laenor are discussing the very thing happening before their eyes questioning what to do — and what you are trying to do.   “Maybe she just likes the buckle again” Laenor hushes. “Maybe she wants another one.”  “No no I’m pretty sure she’s asking him if he is already betrothed”  Viserys and Laenor send a nasty glare to Corlys “She’s six I surely hope not” mutters your grandsire worried about his little girl growing up and most of all getting interested in boys. Have you really already passed that phase where you think that boys are gross? Is he really getting that old?  “Ten Gold Dragons that she’s waiting for him to ask her to dance.” Rhaenyra cuts in. Rhaenys nods taking a sip of her wine. “I would bet a hundred coins on that one.”)  The music is slow and it almost drags the silence between you and the boy as you just stare at him. “I like this music.”  “Erm yes” Cregan grimaces. He fears he knows where this is going. “It is pretty lovely.”  Another moment of silence passes. “I also really like dancing” you add.   He sighs. There’s really no escape now. “Would you mayhaps like to dance Princess?”  You squeal girlish and childish and immediately take his hand to drag him with you to the dancefloor. You don’t know the dance too well and your steps are a bit clumsy but your enthusiasm definitely makes up for it. At some point though his feet are begging for mercy after being stomped on for ten minutes so he takes the matters in his own hands and lifts you up enough for your tiptoes to rest upon his feet so that he has to dance and you just have to stay balanced.  You giggle blushing and looking up at him grinning. He has the terrible feeling that he’s not getting out of here anytime soon.   (Viserys lets out a pained sigh thinking about his dear late wife. “She looks so much like her grandmother”   Corlys nods looking at Rhaenys. “She does.”)  People around you two are dancing and swirling too and they chuckle at Cregan sending him back to six years ago and making him feel a terrible deja-vu. At least she’s not pulling my hair anymore. He does have to admit that you’re a bit cute though — you look so focused looking at his feet and trying to memorise the steps as best as you can. But the fact that you’re cute doesn’t mean he wouldn’t have preferred going to sleep over dancing.   He finds his saviour in a servant who awkwardly stops your dance by bowing. “My Princess my Lord” the boy doesn’t mind correcting him on the honorifice since he technically is here in the name of his father. The servant’s voice has a certain urgency. “A raven has just arrived from Winterfell. It’s from Lord Rickon Stark.”   Cregan nods “I’ll come in a minute” he’s already out of the dancefloor but then you tug on his cloak big doe eyes staring at him. “But we have to finish our dance”   He sighs and from the corner of his vision he sees Laenor Velaryon coming to get you. “I’m sorry Princess I’m sure there’ll be another time for us to dance again” I hope not “But now I really have to go.”   Your lower lip trembles you let out a whine. Before he can even realise he’s about to witness a grade eight type of meltdown Laenor saves the day. He comes up behind you taking your arms in his hands smiling as sweetly as he can. “I can dance with you” he offers.   “But I want to dance with him”   Your father tries to suppress a cry of horror from the fact that you don’t want to dance with him — you’ve never rejected a dance with him before now. This is a first. He looks at Cregan trying his best not to glare at him understanding that this is not a situation he will get out of easily. “Would you perhaps be interested in becoming a ward here boy?” he asks barely managing to stop you from squirming in his grip. “She really likes you and you would have the chance to stay in the Crown Lands for the time being. It is a great opportunity.”  At this point he’s sounding desperate. Please stay here my daughter will throw a fit if you go away. It seems you have found yourself a new toy and unfortunately it’s not one of the new gifts that the lords brought. “You could be squire cupbearer– oof” you land a particularly harsh blow on his ribs and he loses his breath for a moment “Lord Commander of the City Watch anything you want.” he leans down so that he’s more to his height “Please.” he whispers all his desperation clear in his strained voice.   For some unknown reason you calm down in an instant. Laenor fears that if he looks at you you’re going to start complaining again so his gaze remains on the boy who now looks terrified. Evidently he has understood that he has to run and fast. “Um– I– I’m flattered” the Stark murmurs. “But unfortunately I’ve got duties up in the North as heir a– and um a letter from my father has just arrived. So please excuse me” he bows one last time before bolting out of the hall the servant in front of him.   Laenor sighs. He finally looks down at you disappointed and–  “Is that a knife?” you put it behind your back before he can see better and try your best to resist his wrangling with one hand. It does not take much for your father to take the dagger out of your hands and realise it was the ceremonial dagger Cregan was carrying around before. He pales. “Is that why you stopped whining? How did you even get this?”  You look away. “I don’t know. I just took it.” you blush “It was shiny”   It is of beautiful manufacture — the hilt is a direwolf much like the Stark’s emblem and out of his mouth comes the blade. Your father sighs. “This is bad sweetling. You don’t get to steal from others am I clear? Tomorrow you’ll apologise to Lord Cregan and you’ll give it back to him.”  You pout but it doesn’t last long. Because your grandsire comes up behind you waving a hand at Laenor. “Aw come on she’s just a child. If she likes it so much she can keep it. I’ll make sure to send the boy a dagger twice the worth of that one.”  Your eyes shine looking up at your grandfather. “Really? I can keep it?”   “Of course not–”  “Of course” your grandsire says and that’s all that matters because he’s the King. You snatch the dagger from your father and run to Jace and Luke to show them your prize.   Rhaenyra comes up to her father and husband Laenor sulking and Viserys grinning. “May I ask why my firstborn is parading a dagger that I saw the Stark boy wear earlier to her brothers?”   “She liked it” her father simply says. “Was I supposed to just leave her heartbroken by the boy? She had to have some kind of compensation at least.”   She rolls her eyes “Father that was not heartbreak. That’s the kind of reaction she has when we take away her dolls.” your mother shivers “May the Gods help us all the day her first heartbreak comes through.”  Rhaenyra surely didn’t think your first heartbreak would have come so soon.   “How is it possible?” she seethes arms crossed and a glare that could kill.   The dragon keeper falters. “Well– you see my Princess the Cannibal landed a few hours ago in the pit. We didn’t give it much thought since he always comes and goes but then we noticed that a few hatchlings were missing and–”   “And you realised he ate them” Laenor sighs. He’s already preparing himself for the world-shattering tantrum you’ll throw once you’ll know that Merrax was fucking eaten.   The keeper nods. “Yes. And he has um… let’s say usurped the hatchling’s cave. We secured the other younglings but if he were to discover them we wouldn’t be able to stop him. He’s a wild dragon and second in size only to Vhagar so–”  “I want his head” Rhaenyra declares. “And if I have to storm into the Dragonpit and kill him myself to do so then I will.”  “My Princess please reconsider” the keeper cries out. “The Cannibal is one of the oldest dragons and is thought to be one of Balerion’s offsprings– one of the only ones to have survived. Killing him would be like… like erasing a part of your family’s history!”  “Erasing a part of my family’s history?” Rhaenyra booms. “Erasing a part of my family’s history?! He’s already making sure of it! How are our children supposed to claim dragons if he eats them all? He’s an abomination! Nobody ever even dared to give him a name and he’s one of the only offsprings of Balerion left just because he ate his own siblings in the cradle some even before they could hatch!”  “Nyra calm down” Laenor chastises. “Yes it is a tragedy and I don’t even want to think about how our daughter will react–”  At that she laughs bitterly “Ooh she’ll be pissed!”  “–Yes she will but you know what? At least she hadn’t bonded yet with Merrax. She can still claim some other dragon or– or– another dragon could hatch before she is of age to claim one.”   “She is in the age of claiming one!” his wife rages. “I was seven summers when I claimed one and I made sure that she would be able to surpass me and become the youngest dragon rider at only six– but of course the fucking Cannibal had to eat her dragon!”  “Princess Helaena’s hatchling was eaten too” the keeper whispers. “And even though he hatched at birth she never bonded with him and is instead bonded to Dreamfyre. Dragons are put in cradles in hope of the bonding process being easier in the future but still not all dragons that hatch in the cradle become bonded with the ones they shared it with. The young Princess still has options.”   “I don’t care that she does I want the Cannibal dead!”  It is quite late in the evening after the feast so all children should be asleep but you are not. You are in your aunt’s chambers near to your own playing with your dolls as Helaena hums songs and sews new dresses for you.   “And while the dragon’s scales were as red as flames” she sings quietly “the maiden’s eyes were as blue as sapphires…”   The singing is easily tuned out by the screaming match that is happening outside probably down the hallway or in the gardens. You can hear the voice of your mother enraged and your father who’s just trying to calm her down.   You rise from the floor leaving your dolls there opening the door of the chamber and peeking an eye out. Ser Harrold Westerling stationed in front of the door is quick to notice you even as your mother screams and rages. “Princess” he whispers kneeling down. “You should be asleep. Please get back inside”  Meanwhile your mother cries out “Merrax is dead! And with her another four dragons died all because you’re too scared of a stupid wild dragon! Why should my daughter suffer because of your cowardice? I’ll slay the Cannibal myself if you don’t dare to do so!”   Both you and the knight stop in your tracks. Your breath hitches. Merrax is… dead?   You’re just a child — you are yet to grasp the concept of death. You know the late Queen Aemma your grandmother is dead. She died giving birth to your uncle Baelon — who died too. You are a child surrounded by death yet not touched by it. You know the names of people who have died relatives and not — Alysanne Aemon Balerion Aemma Baelon — but they were all before you were born. You’ve never suffered a real loss.   “What… what does it mean?” you ask Harrold trembling. “Where– where did Merrax go? To Old Valyria?” your grandsire while telling you about Balerion the largest dragon in the world that he once rode said that when dragons died they went back there. “We can– we can search for her right? We… we must.”   Your mother is none the wiser about your presence down the hallway cursing in High Valyrian and threatening the dragon keeper. Your father instead notices. “Nyra” he calls her placing a hand on her shoulder. “Stop.”  She does annoyed but once she sees your little trembling form coming out of Helaena’s chambers she feels her blood freeze. There’s no way of breaking the news gently now.   She dismisses the dragon keeper rushing to get you; Laenor takes you in his arms bidding his goodbyes to Harrold and Helaena holding you tight to his chest while walking towards your chambers. You’re awfully quiet shaking like a leaf eyes barred open despite the late hour.   Reaching your chambers Laenor sits you down on the settee by the fireplace kneeling down in front of you with Rhaenyra and holding your hand. Nobody is saying anything and it scares you. Somehow it makes it all feel more real. You whimper because it just can’t be. “I– where… where’s Merrax?”  “Sweetling” your mother starts. “There’s a wild dragon known as the Cannibal that has been eating our hatchlings for centuries. We don’t know how old he actually is– some say he’s an offspring of Balerion your grandsire’s late dragon and Vhagar. That would make him one of the two only dragons still alive to this day to have seen Old Valyria before the Doom– that’s why us Targaryens were always adamant about getting rid of him.”  You know about the Cannibal — so why is she telling you this? “The other reason is that nobody has ever managed to approach him” your father adds. “He eats everything that gets near him and often wanders to Dragonstone from King’s Landing and vice versa. That is to say sweetling… there’s nothing we could have done to save her.”   That is not true Rhaenyra thinks but it is best if the guilt rests on us rather than upon her.   “What does it mean?” you babble. “Merrax… where…”  “Merrax has been eaten sweetling” says Rhaenyra ripping off the bandaid. “The Cannibal has taken her.”  You shake your head eyes filling with tears. “But– but she was mine!”  “We know sweetling–”  “She was born with me for me! She was my dragon– she had just started to eat from my hand!” now tears flow down your face as you weep cheeks blotchy and an angry red. “Am I supposed to live like Aemond from now on? Without a dragon bullied by Aegon and rejected by every hatchling? Why– what will grandsire think of me? He was the last rider of Balerion and his only granddaughter’s dragon died before she could even bond with her!”  Your cries are now inconsolable and you reach for your parents falling into their arms on the floor with them. “Your– you gave me your riding clothes from when you were my age and had them tailored just for me but I can’t wear them without a dragon! I’ll just look stupid!”  Rhaenyra coos brushing your hair back from your face and kissing your temple. “Calm down my sweet. You shall not become like Aemond — you had not bonded yet with your dragon. And as much as Merrax’s death pains me too ‘tis not the end of the world. There are other hatchlings and adult dragons without a rider who are just waiting for the right Targaryen to claim them.”   She kisses your eyes and cheeks wiping your tears. “And I’m sure at least one of them is waiting just for you.”  You have a plan. ‘Tis not really smart but you are six summers old and have a dream. A dream that your mother always reputed you capable of — becoming the youngest dragon rider surpassing her. You’re not about to let that dream go just because a stupid grandpa of a dragon ate your hatchling.  Until the Cannibal is back on Dragonstone your mother refuses to let you go to the Dragonpit insisting that he’s already stayed for too long — surely he’s about to go off his way again right?  (Apparently not. Helaena who wasn’t forbidden from going to the pit said that the dragon keepers are worried: it seems the Cannibal is taking his time — waiting for something or someone.)  The plan is secretly going with Heleana to the Dragonpit right before supper. As she visits Dreamfyre you should be able to seek one of the hatchlings — and maybe one of them will take pity on you and allow you to ride them.   The first part goes pretty well. You get in the dragon riding attire your mother had gifted you and that she once wore — black with red embroidery displaying the Targaryen emblem on your chest — and just get in the carriage right next to Helaena. Ser Criston Cole the knight assigned to her for the afternoon doesn’t even spare you a glance; he never does that’s why you chose today of all days to come with your aunt.   She is nervous fidgeting with her hands and playing with her rings. “Are you sure it wouldn’t be wiser for you to stay in the Keep?” she asks worriedly. “It doesn’t matter if for a while you won’t have a dragon. I claimed mine just last year and I’m older than you.”  You don’t reply — you’ve been rather silent in the last few days unlike your usual self. Rhaenyra finds it even worse than your tantrums — she wishes you would just get it out and scream instead of remaining as silent as a ghost your ramblings now an almost distant memory. They all just wish you could be the same as before the feast before Merrax was eaten.   The ride to the Dragonpit is short but awkward and you wonder how your mother will react once she realises you sneaked out. It probably won’t take her much longer to notice your absence so you have to either be quick or hide in the Dragonpit for the night if you wish to ride a dragon before your seventh name day.   As you exit the carriage a dragon keeper welcomes you and Helaena; he looks confused as to why you’re here but quickly shakes it off guiding you two towards the caves where the dragons rest. He hesitantly sends a glance to you “The hatchlings are also there — Dreamfyre has her own clutch and with the Cannibal near we prefer to keep them with their own parents so they may be protected.”   You nod as he guides you into one of the caves a pretty light-blue and silver dragon chained in there. With Dreamfyre there are four hatchlings all much similar to her all sleeping and chained.   The keeper frees Dreamfyre from her chains and she immediately darts to Helaena gently nudging her with her snout. “Rytsas issa hāedar” Hello my girl she says. You know the basics of Valyrian — your mother made sure you knew enough to be able to claim and ride a dragon even if it’s not as fluent as you’d like. You just understand it better than you speak it.   You watch the hatchlings as they start to rouse; there’s a pretty one with blue and red scales that you intend to approach–   Then you hear something.   A low rumble coming from another cave one that shakes the whole pit. “The Cannibal” the dragon keeper mutters spitefully. “What a monster.”   Well that’s too bad because you’ve already lost interest in the hatchling you saw earlier and now your eyes are set on another possibility. The Cannibal.  No one ever managed to claim him and all that tried are long dead. He can’t be killed as the other dragons know better than to get near him and there’s no amount of gold that could convince any man to try. Yet he’s the one who killed Merrax the one to have killed the dragon that should have been yours; he owes you a debt and it has to be paid.   The dragon keeper is too preoccupied with Dreamfyre and her hatchlings to notice your absence and you are quick to snatch one of the torches on the walls to guide yourself through the various caves. You can feel the Cannibal’s presence somehow; it haunts the pit hanging like a weight over the caves and suddenly you understand why the dragons have been so uneasy since his arrival. The air is heavy and smells of burnt flesh smoke lingering between the corridors.   The rumbling that you heard earlier is heard again and you know that he’s near. And he is — only two caves away you find him.   He’s of a pitch black colour and is covered in spikes which — much like his tail — fade in a deep green. Some of his scales at the light of the fire shine of the same colour too; now you understand why he’s thought of being the son of Balerion and Vhagar because if it weren’t for the torch revealing his green shades you’d think he was the Black Dread come back to life. Two horns rest above his eyes tipped backwards and almost pointing at his wings. He’s massive and it’s clear that this cave wasn’t meant for him as it’s definitely much too small for his form. It was meant for the hatchlings — the hatchlings he ate.   He opens his eyes roused from his sleep and two gigantic emeralds stare down at you almost mockingly. He makes no move towards you nor tries to eat you so maybe that’s a good sign.   “You’re the Cannibal” you whisper stupidly. “You’re the one who killed Merrax.”  He barely grunts in response maybe uninterested in you maybe in assent.   You then understand that if you truly want to claim and ride a dragon then you must gather all the courage your little body can muster up and use it. “You ate Merrax” you state more firmly all the anger you’ve felt in the last few days finally getting the best of you. “Ao enkagon nyke iā gēlȳn.” You owe me a debt.   This time he props his head up; he looks entertained almost as if he’s betting on what you’ll do. You can’t hurt him — you’re but a child — and you surely can’t kill him. So what are you going to do?   There’s a rack of rope near the entrance of the cave probably used for the hatchlings when they were still alive. You put down the torch leaving it on the sand of the pit and roll up the rope holding it between your arm and shoulder. The Cannibal has no saddle so you’ll have to find a way not to fall off of him. Your mother’s going to kill you if you do — but let’s see if you live enough for her to be able to do that.   The climb to reach the top of the Cannibal’s neck looks hard but you’re stubborn and would rather die than let him go away with the fact that he ate Merrax. If you can’t kill him then you’re going to bother him for the rest of your life. So the only thing you can do is start climbing.   He seems confused by your doing as you’re clinging to the spikes and scales trying to reach the top of his neck. He shakes it somewhat in a gentle manner and you fall on your butt not from high enough to actually hurt but from high enough to have a bruised ego.   “What is wrong with you?” you scream out angry. “You killed my dragon the last thing you can do is replace her!”  Your voice dies a little by the end because the Cannibal has gotten up and leant down opening his left wing almost inviting you to mount him. You’re completely weirded out but surely enough are not going to reject his offer.   Quickly getting up with the wing serving as some sort of stairs in a matter of mere minutes you find yourself on top of the Cannibal who looks like he’s just waiting for you to say something. “Okay okay” you mumble to yourself. You’re not scared — well not of him but of your mother. Oh once she hears about this you’ll be grounded until you’re ready to be wed.   With the rope you tie yourself to the dragon using his spikes to hold the cord firm onto his body. You give him a pat on the scales adjusting to the feeling of being so high up. “Um… iōrās?” you order him to stand but it sounds more like a question.   He does follow your demand though standing up straighter ready to get out. “Whoa– alright.” you hold onto the spikes tighter “Well I have to name you first big guy.”  He turns his head to look at you almost confused. “I can’t just keep calling you the Cannibal because I won’t let you eat any more hatchlings.” At this he grunts in disapproval but you go on telling yourself that he surely doesn’t understand the common tongue and just wants to go against you. “My mother calls all her dragon’s hatchlings with names ending in ax because her mount’s name is Syrax. So I could call you something like… I don’t know Rhaerion?”  He grumbles and you grimace. “I don’t think you deserve your father’s name though. You eat baby dragons while Balerion was loyal and obedient.” You search your brain for names Valyrian or not that would suit him before having the idea of a lifetime.  You know some basics of High Valyrian enough to make a dragon fly always says your mother. Helaena is pretty good at it Aemond is almost fluent and your brothers are still learning it. Your uncle Aegon instead is completely ignorant of it except for cursing words. He likes to call anyone an orvorta but he has a favourite cuss word usually used for your brothers — and while it makes you mad that he refers to them in such a way you have to admit that it is a name quite fitting for your dragon.   “Your name shall be Nādrēsy” you tell him. “That is until you redeem yourself. Then I may decide to find you another name maybe a kinder one.”   He roars shaking his head looking at you in disappointment. You can hear the dragon keepers shout your name in the corridors having finally noticed your absence — or maybe your presence since you shouldn’t have been there since the beginning. You hold onto the dragon’s spikes as hard as you can preparing yourself for some movement.   “Jiōragon hen hen kesīr Nādrēsy!” you order with the same tone your grandsire uses while holding court. Get out of here.   He does as you ask moving on all fours with steps that make the Dragonpit shake. You see two keepers in front of you frozen in fear but it’s not long before they start screaming and running away.   You get to the entrance of the Dragonpit and from where you sit you see a group of gold cloaks standing not too far away behind Ser Harwin Strong — who apparently barely notices the dragon behind him too preoccupied in screaming in Ser Criston Cole’s face about how “it’s all his fault that the princess is missing” and how “the King should have his head”.   While you never liked Cole too much as he seemed to despise you for no reason you didn’t wish for him to be beheaded because of you. So you stop Nādrēsy and cupping your mouth with your hands you scream “Ser Harwin! I’m here!”   At first the Lord Commander doesn’t understand where you are looking around and sending a glance at Cole that says this doesn’t end here but once he sees you all the blood drains from his face as well as from the face of Ser Criston and the other knights. “Princess!” he screams hysteric. “Get off of there it’s dangerous! Your mother has been searching for you and she’s worried!”  But it seems that you already can’t hear him returning all your attention to your dragon. “Gaomagon ao gīmigon skoriot Driftmark iksis?” you ask him. Do you know where Driftmark is?  You have all the intentions of keeping the promise you made to your grandmother about your first flight being one to visit her and Corlys on Driftmark. They had just gotten back a couple of days ago but you’re sure that they would still be happy to see you. Right now you don’t think about your parents too euphoric of finally having a dragon of your own as you are — and that will probably cost you another two years you’ll have to spend grounded.   Nādrēsy roars loudly opening his wings and taking flight.   Not even ten hours later you find yourself on Driftmark under the worried glance of your grandparents who upon hearing your story are asking themselves if Rhaenyra has already thrown herself into madness. You happily show them your new acquaintance who unexpectedly purrs when you caress his snout and doesn’t look like the Cannibal who ate countless of hatchlings.   “That’s… that’s marvellous sweetheart” Rhaenys is a bit shaken but still tries to be supportive. “Does your mother perhaps know that you’re here?”   “Of course not! She would throw a fit otherwise.”  All their fears are confirmed to be true and your grandmother immediately asks a servant for paper and pen to write to King’s Landing. And as you tell them how you renamed the Cannibal Corlys pales thinking that with you being daughter of Rhaenyra you could have chosen something way worse. He’s just grateful that the common folk doesn’t know High Valyrian.   Two days later a raven comes from Driftmark finally putting at ease the concerns of the whole court and stopping Rhaenyra and Laenor from getting any more grey hairs.   To King Viserys I Targaryen his daughter Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and her husband Ser Laenor Velaryon.   The Princess (who you have been searching for I assume) has just landed on Driftmark. She is safe and sound thankfully and she rode ten hours on a dragon known for his wilderness without a saddle secured on him only by a cord. She renamed the Cannibal (funnily enough if you wish to know his name now is ‘Nādrēsy’) who is now eating all the whales and sharks of the Narrow Sea that he can see from the island. We managed to put a saddle on him so that the next time she’ll ride him the chances of falling off his back are minimal and I will accompany her back to King’s Landing on Meleys myself as soon as she takes a good rest and is able to get on the dragon again. Me and my husband took the liberty to give her an earful about her recklessness and irresponsibility but we’re sure you’ll choose a considerate punishment for her behaviour once she returns to King’s Landing.    Yours truly Princess Rhaenys Targaryen.  Rhaenyra puts down the letter taking a deep breath telling herself that violence is not the answer. Unfortunately all she can think about is giving you two slaps at a time until the number becomes uneven.   Laenor sighs rubbing his eyes. They both haven’t slept much in the last two days too worried to even think about stopping the research for you. “Well at least she’s alive.”  To their grand surprise Viserys bursts out laughing. “See?” he says to his daughter. “That’s what you put me through when you were young. Ooh you’re in for at least twelve years of worrying and suffering. Rhaenyra my dear daughter I’m glad to announce that your daughter came out just like you.” he then rises from his seat laughing like a madman. “My granddaughter is the youngest dragon rider in history!” he screams feeling as young as he hadn’t felt in a while. “Oh boy I’ll have to organise a whole other feast for this!”  Meanwhile Rhaenyra just stares at the letter; she’s not surprised you sneaked out because that’s what she would have done in the same situation and she has to admit that there are some similarities between you and the way she was before having you. There’s just one thing that almost makes her think that you really are a younger version of her come back from the past to haunt her for all the scares she gave her father during the years.  “Bastard” she mutters. “My daughter out of all the proper names she could have chosen called her dragon Bastard.”,2024-07-13 02:30:31 GMT

The original scene was much shorter: Emma and Olivia two very talented actors who know their characters well expanded it. They weren’t just wasting time or suddenly lacking in talent and insight. They knew what they were doing and it connects all the way back.   So let’s go all the way back! Where do we begin? Episode 1x01 King Viserys wants a son and male heir; he has wanted a son for so long that Rhaenyra his 14-year-old daughter says (ep 1x01) “For as long as I can recall it’s all he’s wanted.” What has this done to her? Well for one thing it has made her mother who has difficult pregnancies in ill health for most of her life. This ill health means that Aemma did a lot of lecturing (and trying to keep Rhaenyra from flying and doing other risky things while she was sick) and not a lot of getting to spend quality time with her daughter. A distracted father ruling the realm and a mother sick with trying to give him the male heir he prioritizes above his wife and daughter.  Who has been there for Rhaenyra? Alicent. Alicent was hers. When Rhaenyra flies on her dragon experiencing freedom from all her worries and power and joy she wants ALICENT to be there with her high above the sea looking out over the city:  source: 1x01 script  When Rhaenyra had to have a difficult conversation with her mother it was Alicent she looked to for comfort and emotional support – in an act a cut scene from the script *explicitly calls “flirting”*. Rhaenyra relies on and longs for that “disarming kindness” she says Alicent has.  And it was Alicent’s lap that Rhaenyra flirts about loving to lie upon. Alicent is so much to Rhaenyra that she dreams of running away together just the two of them and Rhaenyra’s bonded dragon Syrax.   Alicent was her cherished girl her comfort and her chief supporter and advisor. She was Rhaenyra’s heart’s rest. And yes - it was a friendship blossoming into flirtation and desire as the two matured. They were on the cusp of something. They were the world to each other.   source  Emma and Olivia get it and have always gotten it. Rhaenyra has this gorgeous yang or solar energy that finds balance with Alicent’s yin or lunar energy. They’re a sun and moon couple balancing each other’s strengths and weaknesses. With Alicent the sword of Rhaenyra’s intense energy has a sheath. A resting place. Her fire has a hearth. And Alicent isn’t drained by people (like Viserys would later do…) who just take and take and take – hurting her and draining that “disarming kindness” of hers until she’s broken and ruined inside. Rhaenyra gives and cherishes in a way that made Alicent feel whole and appreciated.   Rhaenyra goes from being angry (angry the way a jilted lover would be - calling Alicent a “whore” for what she felt emotionally imo as Alicent cheating on Rhaenyra with her father) to instantly deeply protective and possessive once she learns more. See the cut scene after Viserys reveals his engagement to Alicent:  script pages source photo source  Rhaenyra is ready to take on the whole Seven Kingdoms to protect her girl!  Rhaenyra liked being the focus of Alicent playing the “lady beloved” role - reading soothingly to her supporting and encouraging and admiring her teasing her for being naughty advising her about her political situation. She found rest and comfort there - and then Viserys took her mother cutting her open to get his precious son out. And then in his remorse and grief he took comfort in Rhaenyra’s girl (who was forced to give him that precious kindness of hers by her father) and her father *stole her girl too*. Not only did he steal her girl he put her own status as heir into question by having a firstborn son with her - after wounding Rhaenyra deeply by chasing a son as far back as she could remember!  All the “she should be over it” stuff about Alicent… if Rhaenyra were a male character people would recognize the wound of having his crush stolen out from under him by his old man at the same time his old man refuses to fully back his status as heir - it’s archetypal! It’s gd Greek. Your old man trying to keep you from the girl you want from your desires and destiny as an adult.   Rhaenyra makes total sense in the Sept scene - she has the primal wound of a girl who is an HEIR - who wanted to have things and act and possess and stand tall and be the lover to a girl’s beloved in a way only boys are allowed in this society… and whose father took her girl away from her as well as making her feel uncertain of her status in a deeply wounding way. Rhaenyra correctly locates emotionally her rupture from Alicent as where it all went wrong. The Sept scene is about all of that emotionally and it makes total sense. It is also about Rhaenyra’s sheer desperation and comprehension of the horror coming… and the most heartbreaking longing to return to a time when Alicent’s heart was her home.   Alicent’s heart was Rhaenyra’s home. And her father stole the girl she loved. He took her and savaged and used and broke her and made her give birth to children she didn’t want (at least not with him) from decades of sex she did. not. want. because even men who think they’re nice in this society are allowed that - to cut a wife open for a son to use a girl young enough to be his daughter. He vacillated between wounding and affirming Rhaenyra never fully able to honor her as his heir because she was not a boy. And he couldn’t even conceive of her feelings for Alicent because this is a deeply homophobic society - but he was also even seeing it in a platonic light selfish and inconsiderate of her feelings for her best friend.   He kept putting his feelings and needs first over his wife over his daughter over her best friend.   I don’t care if nobody else gets it - the way Emma plays it? They get it. They’re an extremely talented actor who wasn’t going “ooc” in the Sept - they were playing *that*. My father inflicted these primal wounds on me because my coming of age was more like a boy’s–like things that should be allowed girls but are denied them– and he thwarted me and yet I love him. And I love Alicent and I long for her heart though it’s full of poison and broken things now. Why does it all have to be like this? Why does it have to hurt so much?   The Sept scene is entirely in character for both of them. It is not “fanfic.” It is not OOC. It is the broken heart of this tragedy bleeding before our eyes.,2024-07-13 03:27:28 GMT

Daemon/Rhaenyra’s age-gap is close to 20 years apart. We had scenes of them with implied sexual tension even when Rhaenyra was only 14 in episode 1 yet no one seemed to have a problem with that.    Viserys/Alicent..we won’t even talk about the age-gap between these two because it’s just absurd but it is an arranged marriage. Yet again most people don’t seem to have a problem with this.   Aemond/Alys or Daemon/Alys the largest age-gap thus far considering Gayle Rankin claims that Alys is nearly 400 years old beneath her glimmer.   Lastly Aemond/Lucerys these two have the least of the age-gaps as they are only 3 years apart and yet people still call this the most “monstrous” of all the ships in show-verse. I get it Elliot who plays Luke is far younger than Ewan so the age disparity is more obvious than it should be in canon but so was Matt Smith and Milly Alcock when they portrayed Daemon/Rhaenyra…Let’s be real though the main reason people are offended by this pairing is because it’s a queer ship. Had Lucerys been a girl there wouldn’t be near as much affront. I know a lot of talented amazing individuals who have written for this ship..particularly aged-up Aemond/Lucerys and none of them deserve the hate directed towards them nor their work when there are far more disturbing ships in the show. Not everyone who supports this pairing condone fanart/works portraying the underage actor. So let’s stop acting like everyone who ships Lucerys/Aemond is demon spawn for seven hells sake. 🤝,2024-07-13 02:38:44 GMT

Not much but just enough that the heels of her boots sank into the soil like it was sand on a beach slowly her incrementally as she ran as fast as she could through the woods. She’d begun running at sunset. It was almost fully dark now the indigo skies creating large dark shadows that seemed to mock her as she hurried past branches and jumping over babbling brooks.  This began do to a sudden unrestrained thought. Ben Blackwood had been sneering at her by the creek claiming that the rock she was sitting on was on Blackwood land and that meant she was not only trespassing but also now was Blackwood property as well while leaning down and making that stupid face at her.  It had been an idea that came so suddenly and clearly Elma could’ve done nothing else.  Once his face was within two feet of her she’d risen up her fist and socked him on the nose.  Then she’d laughed right in his pained startled face. Very quickly that surprise had turned into furious outrage so she’d had to move quickly. Elma had shoved him into the creek as hard as she could not even turning back to see him splashing against the water before she’d begun sprinting away.  And now she was running through the woods. With Bloody Ben not far behind her.  She could hear his breath and the sound of his grunts which were coming closer and closer. It was that it would take time after she ducked a branch before she heard it snap the savage Blackwood breaking the twigs off rather than take the time to dodge them as she had.  Anticipation had riled her unimaginably. Her heart was pounding in her chest she could hear every thud within her ears.  Thud thud thud. The soft upturned soil sinking and spitting out every time boots sank into it.  Elma was starting to tire her legs were protesting every movement now and her breath was becoming so loud. She was almost considering stopping letting him catch her - after all if she let him catch her it was not like he had won. She’d have just chosen to let the game end.  And it was when she was considering slowing after she’d jumped over a rather wide stream that she’d noticed it: the sudden lack of noise.  So her legs halted in place the soil making way to moss as she struggled to silence her own heaving breaths even having to cover her own mouth as she turned to look behind her.  Nothing. There was no one.  And it was no longer just dark it was black now. Night had fully fallen over her and worser now she couldn’t see Benjicot behind her. Had he stopped? Decided that she was not worth the trouble by chasing her all through the woods? And decided that actually leaving her alone with no weapon or light would be punishment enough for hitting him?  It was just as she was starting to become truly actually afraid when she heard a snap of a twig.  Elma gasped.   And then she was taken hold of and that soft soil she’d been so frustrated with cushioned her fall as she fell face first into the dirt and moss.   “Spread your fucking legs.” Ben demanded lowly into her ear.  She obeyed mindlessly out of breath from the force of his throw.  Immediately he shoved himself between her thighs pushing up her skirts from behind and pushing her small clothes out of the way with little care for her before his cock was shoved inside of her wet cunt. Then he began to fuck her. He did so hard and fast his hips hammering against her without any other preamble not even touching her any further other than merely holding her hard against the dirt.  The angle wasn’t quite right for her to feel pleasure but that didn’t seem to matter. Every thrust she became wetter and wetter until squelching noises joined Ben’s heavy grunts as he used her.  His hips soon changed the pace from hard and fast to now just hard as if he were trying to bruise her from his thrusts alone.  And he may have succeeded - as her rear was feeling more tender when he finally came inside of her his cum shooting well inside of her cunt until she could feel it spilling out.   When he pulled out of her she realized she was trembling.   Benjicot must’ve realized it too because after a few moments he laid himself against her wrapping one arm around her waist and the other loosely under her neck while he lowered his face into her hair.  The pressure felt good.  But not as good as the kiss that he pressed against the back of her hair holding her warm and safe against his body.,2024-07-13 04:50:55 GMT

Sometimes Y/n cares sometimes she doesn’t but if there’s one thing she never cares about it’s the thick black gloves that her husband wears when he goes flying.  WARNING: 18+ mdni!

Word cont: 2.900 k  Author’s note: Okay I was just casually scrolling through Aemond’s tag when this idea came up and yes I was writing the bottom half of the fourth chapter of The Gossip but I HAD to write this story! @peachysunrize I hope you like it I added some inventions from my head in the middle of it 💕💕. English is not my first language so be kind if you can.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Y/n Arryn was a respectable and well-regarded lady throughout Westeros there were men fighting for her hand as soon as she was old enough to marry. Proposals came from the North the Rech and even Dorne but the one that was of most interest to Lord Arryn was the one that came in a black envelope with red edges sealed with the Targaryen family crest.  The hand of the king had proposed marriage between Y/n and his grandson Prince Aemond Targaryen. The young woman felt her heart come to her mouth as soon as her father told her what he had decided she would marry Prince Aemond in two moons.  The first time Y/n set foot on Kings Landing she was terrified the idea of marrying a man she barely knew making her thoughts cloudier than water. And when she met Prince Aemond this terror increased even more something she didn’t think was possible.  He was as scary and taciturn as they had told her he barely gave her a look and only said two words of courtesy other than muttering every now and then while looking down on everyone as if he were from a race superior to mere mortals.  Y/n’s fear became even more overwhelming after she met Aegon Aemond’s older brother. Her heart ached as she listened to the gossip around the fortress about how he cheated on his wife how he was always drunk and how he spent more time in the brothels than in the fortress. Sadness took over her and she imagined how terrible life itself would be from now on.  How wrong she was.  Things began to change on the night of the wedding when the prince vehemently denied a bed ceremony. Y/n was so nervous the fear of the nuptials was already consuming her combined with the fact that other people would be watching it made her tremble until Aemond denied the ceremony and ripped that fear out of her.  The remaining fear was quickly extinguished when Aemond gently laid her on the bed and made her cry with pleasure in a way she never thought possible. Her hands tangled in his silver strands of hair as he touched her in places that made her blush with embarrassment as she remembered the other day.  From then on little by little she got to know her husband and every day she became more grateful for that. He still had that stoic and arrogant air but now Y/n could see behind it she saw the small acts of importance he gave her daily.  How he made a point of having at least one meal a day with her how he asked how her day had been how every now and then she would wake up after a passionate night and find an arrangement of beautiful flowers on the table in her room. And each of these things from the smallest to the largest warmed her heart until it was completely melted by her husband to the point where she couldn’t wait to be with him.  Little by little Aemond spent more and more time with her and when they weren’t tangled in the sheets so close together that you didn’t know where one began and the other ended they were sitting in the gardens talking or reading together in some quiet place or even just quietly enjoying each other’s company. At a certain point the only one who could receive more attention from Aemond than Y/n was Vhagar since he almost always went on long flights with the dragon.  That afternoon in particular Aemond was taking much longer than usual and Y/n was waiting for him impatiently as she walked around the room. He had promised to arrive before sunset so they would have time to walk around the garden but now the sun had already set and the maids had even lit the candles.  The loud noise of the door suddenly invaded the room and Y/n promptly got up to wait for her husband as soon as he entered her field of vision Y/n arched her eyebrows ironically.  -Did you decide to show up husband? - Moons ago Y/n wouldn’t have spoken to him in such a way in her wildest dreams but now she was so familiar with him that she often didn’t have as much politeness when speaking.  -I’m sorry wife. - He said removing the belt with the dagger and sword and throwing it on the couch. -Vhagar was a little sensitive this afternoon she tends to want to fly longer distances when she is like this.  Y/n just made a humming sound with her mouth instead of responding a habit she had picked up from Aemond without even realizing it. However Y/n couldn’t help biting her lower lip lightly when she saw him still wearing his riding clothes she had never said anything to him but seeing him returning from the flight always affected her mood and it was almost automatic so that she got excited.  -Wife… - Aemond murmured approaching Y/n from behind and holding her firmly by the waist. -Are you by any chance jealous of Vhagar… a dragon?  His voice was incredulous and Y/n burned with embarrassment. Before she could respond Aemond laughed something that rarely happened which made her blush even more as she tried tried to free herself from his arms.  -You don’t need to be embarrassed I find it very flattering that you feel such appreciation for me to the point of feeling jealous. - He arched his eyebrow still smiling. - No matter how unreasonable it may be.  -Husband.. - Y/n complained grumpily looking at her feet.  At that point she was no longer red only from the small misbehavior but also from the thin rough texture of her husband’s riding gloves against her sensitive soft skin. That was always a problem she couldn’t help but sigh every time she saw Aemond arrive wearing those damn gloves. And when he ripped them off and threw them haphazardly on the table? She felt a pressure between her legs that made her want to jump on him.  -What is it? Why are you all bristling wife? - Aemond rubbed his hands against her arms and Y/n shivered even more making him arch his eyebrows again.  -They’re your gloves husband. - She said looking at the floor. – They are rough.  -I can take it off if you want. - He spoke still gently stroking her arms but after speaking he noticed that his wife lowered her eyes and didn’t respond and then approaching her lips to her ear he spoke in a low voice almost making her sigh. - You don’t want me to take it off do you?  -Do you like rougher things dear wife? - And with the question he ran his hands down Y/n’s body and slowly pulled the fabric of the dress up and accumulated them on her hips making Y/n gasp as she felt the rough gloves passing over her thighs and squeezing them. slowly. Aemond couldn’t help but smile when he noticed his wife’s reactions to the roughest touch.  -Come here my dear I’ll show you how much I missed you. - He said pulling her more and more towards him sitting in one of the armchairs in the room while he placed her on his lap facing the large mirror and guided his hands to his wife’s knees slowly separating her legs now being able to see the moisture that had formed in her intimacy.  -I haven’t even touched you yet dear wife and you’re already so wet for me. - His delicious voice sounded in her ear as he slowly moved his hands up her thighs making her desperate for him to get to where she needed him most. The sight of his gloved fingers running up her legs made her roll her eyes with desire.  Aemond smiled mischievously and Y/n held her breath not knowing where to look. His smile intensified as he brought his fingers to her cunt and at this point Y/n was barely breathing with desire.  Slowly he guided two fingers to her entrance and rubbed gently pulling some of the moisture concentrated there and taking it to the pearl which he began to rub languidly eliciting sighs and moans from Y/n.  -You look so beautiful when you open your legs for me. - He murmured brushing his lips gently against the shell of her ear making her let out a louder moan. - So beautiful making these perfect sounds when I’ve barely touched you yet.  He then moved his fingers down and with a smooth movement that made Y/n roll her eyes he penetrated just one gloved finger into her cunt. The sight of his finger disappearing inside her as he admired her with that look of pure adoration made her want to cry with desire.  -Very good beautiful girl. - He sighed as he slowly moved his finger teasing her knowing very well that she needed more. - You always welcome me so well. How about another one?  He had barely asked and Y/n was already nodding her head practically begging for him.  -Such a needy lady my wife is. - He murmured as he inserted another finger inside her making her moan his name with praise. - I can’t leave our bed for a few hours because it becomes a meaningless mess.  Aemond guided his free hand to the front laces of Y/n’s dress and pulled them tightly loosening her wife’s neckline more and more until her breasts were exposed to his pure delight who guided his gloved hand to her erect nipple. of her gently pinching him as he admired her reflection in the mirror.  Meanwhile he moved his fingers slowly inside her and the feeling of the rough fabric of her husband’s gloves against her own soft and wet insides made Y/n see stars and sigh in contentment with the double stimulation. As Aemond fucked her with his fingers he found that spongy spot that took her body out of orbit and when she moaned uncontrollably he smiled even more mischievously against her neck leaving kisses and bites there pinching her nipples even more.  -So good husband. - Y/n sighed leaning on his shoulder.  -You don’t know how much I want to fuck you right now. -He murmured biting her ear and sucking it while he nuzzled his nose in her hair.  Aemond penetrated her third finger making her whimper but unlike before where he caressed her gently he now started to get into a rougher rhythm still slow but with force. And Y/n in turn just clung to his arms as she threw herself back leaning against her husband’s clothed chest and moving her hips in search of more friction.  -So desperate my wife throwing herself against my fingers like a beautiful filthy whore. -He brushed away a few strands of hair that had fallen across her face when he said that so that Y/n could see herself better in the mirror and the sight of her made her moan even louder.  His gloved fingers moving in and out of her cunt his palm firmly massaging her mound the fabric of the gloves slightly moistened and a white ring forming at the base of the fingers contrasting strongly with the dark color they possessed. The contractions of pleasure of her cunt crushing Aemond’s skilled fingers as he smiled and bit her neck working even harder to coax pleasure out of her he loved the feeling of her silky walls squeezing around him.  The way he curled his fingers and then moved them in and out made every nerve ending in Y/n burn. The roughness of the fabric was driving her crazy and she wanted so much more she wanted to be set on fire.  -Husband. - She moaned arching her back and pressing herself even more against him while turning her neck slightly to face him taking one of her hands to his hair and removing the eye patch in the process. - I’m so close… so close. Please.  -I like it as much as you implore my dear. - He guided his other hand to her chin and squeezed it tightly forcing her to keep her eyes exclusively on the mirror’s reflection the rough fabric of the glove making her gasp while the sight of Aemond’s now uncovered sapphire eye made her moan. - But I want you to keep your hungry little eyes on your pussy.  -See how wet she is for me how well she takes my fingers you are dripping my dear wife. - The movements became faster and stronger and Y/n felt some tears run down her cheeks as she moaned uncontrollably at the sight of Aemond’s gloved fingers buried so deeply in her soaked cunt.  And when he accelerated the movements of both his fingers inside Y/n and his palm against her sensitive pearl Y/n cried and screamed as she came against his hand shuddering with pleasure.  Aemond was lost at that scene. He couldn’t take his eyes off his wife’s cunt writhing against his fingers as her juices oozed out between his fingers. Her face full of pleasure as she screamed and begged for his name was another thing that could easily kill him in that instant he would certainly die happy with that scene.  -Look at the mess you make my dear. - He said after removing his fingers from her trembling cunt. - Clean up for me like the good wife I know you are.  Aemond guided his hand to Y/n’s lips and she lazily sucked on his gloved fingers. The taste of the fabric mixed with her own taste further numbing her mind still clouded by the orgasm.  And Aemond could no longer contain himself when he saw that expression of contentment on her face as she sucked on his gloved fingers. And he quickly took her off his lap and bent her over the carpet still facing the mirror making her gasp from the abrupt movement.  Y/n had barely balanced herself and Aemond had already undid the laces of his own pants and guided his cock to her sensitive pussy. They both moaned senselessly as soon as he penetrated her completely. And he quickly brought his hands to the top of her dress dragging it down and leaving her breasts completely free for him to massage and squeeze as he pleased.  He fucked her so well and Y/n lost her breath with each firm thrust from Aemond and panted with pleasure as she whimpered for more with tears in her eyes.  She raised her head looking towards the mirror again and the sight of his hand massaging her hips and squeezing her nipples as he fucked her while still wearing those damned riding gloves made her eyes roll with pleasure and she begged for him with Even more willing looking into his eyes and sighing when finding that blue glow that she had learned to love so much.  -I love that look you have when I’m inside you. - He groaned rolling his eye with pleasure as he fucked her and Y/n lowered her face once again. Aemond then guided his hand to her chin forcing her to look at the mirror again he wouldn’t miss a second of that passionate look that his wife directed just at him and that made Aemond’s heart race.  -No my dear you keep those shining eyes on me while I fuck you like you deserve. - And removing his hand from her chin Aemond went up to her hair and pulled it back holding her firmly and keeping her gaze fixed on the mirror.  -Aemond please. - She whimpered enchanting him with those eyes that made him lose his head and once again he guided the tips of his gloved fingers to the top of her thighs and caressed her forcefully making his wife gasp and moan as she collapsed in front of him who held her. by her hips as he fucked her with abandon looking for his own climax which didn’t take long to come when he came deep inside her.  The two remained motionless their bodies pressed together and their breaths labored. Y/n brought her own bare hand to her husband’s gloved hand and caressed it with gentle circles still completely lost in fleeting pleasure.  -You look even more beautiful when you’re cumming all over my cock. - He murmured still lost in pleasure against her hair making his wife smile.  Y/n in turn faced the mirror and sighed with contentment when she saw their reflection. Aemond behind her still panting with his usually stoic face relaxed in pleasure as he held her against him still holding her thighs firmly to keep her in contact with him as she squeezed lightly every now and then.  -Love you. - She said tiredly still with her head lying on his shoulder looking at him through the mirror.  Aemond didn’t respond with words he just mumbled like he always did. But Y/n no longer needed words she had learned to distinguish every look every touch and every sigh of her husband to know that he was also in love especially when he pulled her even closer and left a soft kiss on her neck .

marriage pacts end the rivalry between the blackwoods and the brackens (i don’t care if this has been done before this is my version gbye)  as always warnings: misogyny davos is a fucking FREAK smuuuuut dirty talk breeding kink  lmk if u want pt 2 — aeron bracken x blackwood!fem!reader ;)  my fiancé actually loosely edited this for me so if this sucks it’s his fault   ____  “let’s get this over with.”   you gulped. you had been dreading this moment ever since your father announced there would be a peace treaty between your family the brackens and the blackwoods. the ceremony the feast and the dancing were not your biggest concern — but your wedding night? nothing could stop your hands from shaking — and your new husband davos blackwood surely wouldn’t step forward and aid you in your time of anxiety.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; you folded your lip in between your teeth playing with the exquisite shift that was custom made for this exact night — a night supposed to be consumed by the throws of pleasure and a hopeful future possibly in the form of an heir. you couldn’t believe the brokering of peace came in the form of a marriage pact — to someone who would never see you as anything but a bracken his enemy.   two marriage pacts actually — you married davos blackwood and your brother aeron bracken married davos’ sister. two feuding families. bound not just by one marriage pact but two — because everyone knew that only one marriage would not have been sufficient for peace. not only was he forced to spend his life or the rest of yours with a bracken — but his sister? forced to marry a bracken as well? aeron bracken? of them all?   you could see it on his face — gray with sick. it turned your stomach as well — to realize you were loathed so much.   “i can’t change who i am” you said suddenly keeping your eyes on the floor. “nor my heritage. i understand you loathe the sight of me for what it reminds you of — but i can’t change that.”   he didn’t respond. he just undressed with his back turned to you save for his pants and under shirt. you watched the muscles in his shoulders and back ripple as he tugged off the garments preparing for bed. you couldn’t see his face as he undressed — and you weren’t sure if it was good or bad. good because you could speak boldly — bad because he refused to look at you and possibly would refuse your request.   “but as your wife… even if it’s the one you didn’t wish for…” you sighed losing your thoughts and confidence. “i promise to not be a bother to you — the only thing i ask… is…”   he turned towards you then but not completely. it was like he gave you his attention but was fully aware of what he withheld from you — even though you were practically baring your soul to him. you weren’t in his head you couldn’t be sure… but his silence was enough of a signal that he most likely would not understand a woman’s anxiety in a moment like this.   here goes absolutely nothing you thought. you mustered up whatever courage you had — albeit very little — and continued “you do not owe me anything — but i… i…”   “spit it out” he bit.   your mouth fell slightly agape with his tone. it was the way feuding men speak to each other — not a feuding husband and wife. it was like you were stripped of your femininity and your new identity as his wife and replaced with that of a rival male — causing you to come to the realization that this feud ran so deep that not even two marriage pacts with the hope of inspiring peace would be sufficient.   he would always hate you. always.   he’s going to hate you as if you’re your brother anyway you thought. might as well have the stones to match.   you clenched your jaw raising your eyeline. you refused to cower to a man when it wouldn’t make him hate you less — and especially not if it definitely wouldn’t get you what you wanted. you were afraid and out of options. with a sigh you responded “be gentle with me the first time. just the first — that is all i ask.”   you held his gaze then — refusing to look away. he needed to know how desperate you were to avoid that unfathomable pain as much as possible. you’d look him in the eye the eye of the enemy of your family for the last few centuries — because otherwise the shame and dishonor was too great and too heavy for a new wife to bear.   if you weren’t so intent on not seeming weak you should have looked — actually looked — at your husband. at how broad his shoulders appeared in comparison to his lean waist and hips. his light eyes that seem to pierce you in a way that only a dagger could; sharp and forever on edge. how he was so handsome that you might done anything to see him smile or laugh… but you couldn’t. wouldn’t. you most likely would never get that chance — but you bet that he looked so handsome when he smiled.   but he would never smile for a bracken.   “be gentle with you?” he asked accusation already in his eyes. his fists were bawled at his sides as he walked towards you. “as if your craven brother would be gentle with my sister?”   “how dare you even insinuate my brother would treat his lady wife with anything but kindness and respect!” you spat leaning towards him with anger dripping from your pretty lips. “he may not like this situation any more than us — but he would never harm a woman no matter what family she came from.”   he shook his head glancing away from you. “you are actually naive enough to believe that?”   you narrowed your eyes at him. “if you’re stupid enough to believe that of him — then why would you want to be the very thing that you hope does not enter your sister’s bed this very same evening? — do you wish to be as despicable as you believe him to be my lord husband?”   “watch your mouth wife!” he spat through gritted teeth. “you would do well to mind your craven tongue.”  you mouth fell agape at his words. “my craven tongue blackwood?” you scoffed at his words suddenly too angry to be in the room with him. you didn’t want to get this angry — you wanted this to be as peaceful as possible. “i suddenly find myself wanting to leave this room — do enjoy our wedding night by yourself husband. i’m sure you’re well acquainted with your hand —“   you went to push by him but he grabbed you by the elbow. he refused to let you pass but you did not press the subject with words or jerking movements of your body. you did not know your husband — only his reputation from the mouths of kin. you did not dare push his anger — not when he could do with you as he pleased in this room with no consequence outside these walls.   “i have been made very well aware of a bracken’s inability to perform their duty — but you will not stop me from performing mine wife” he grit glaring down at you.   “i asked you to perform it honorably husband! — if you can’t then your reputation precedes you” you spat. “so what will it be? i put the cards in your hands — so deal.”   his nose curled into a snarl matching the hateful expression on his face. hatred poured from his veins while you could feel your own resolve slipping away from your face. fear was creeping back in as boldness only got a woman so far in the bedroom of an angry man. fear fear fear. it leaked from every one of your pores like tears but you fought those. you blinked several times in order to hide what you could. if he saw the fear on your face his own expression didn’t change.   …unless he knew the fear was always there and he didn’t care.   “…please” you whispered anger still on your face but your voice threatening to break. “just tonight husband — please.”   “i would never hurt a woman” he spat the flames on his face beginning to subside. “only a bracken —“   “i didn’t think you would hurt a woman” you spoke trying to soften your voice. “i asked — because others have described this pain as one of the worst. i was afraid lord husband — but not of you.”   while you intentionally softened your voice your husband did no such thing. he merely let his anger die with your words most likely at the fact that you were the one to admit weakness. you were the one to admit vulnerability. you were the one to have to beg. you had won but at what cost to your pride?   it didn’t matter now. all that mattered was getting this done. quick done and over with.   “lie on your back” was all he said holding your gaze.   your lips parted as your eyes looked down at the floor. you turned in place and began walking towards the bed. you laid down on fighting the urge to twist your fingers together in anxiety. you kept your head forward but your gaze down and to the side. out of the corner of your eye you could see your husband walk over to the bed and climb on top of you.   he unlaced his leathers as he spoke both of you avoiding the other’s eyes. “avoid allowing your muscles to tense up — it will only make it worse.”   you whispered a small “okay” barely audible.   you opened your legs lifting up slightly at your hips for him to rest comfortably. he adjusted before you watched him bring his hand to his mouth. you couldn’t help yourself — you watched as his lips sucked his long fingers past their opening lubricating the digits. his eyebrows knitted together with the motion before his fingers found their way between your thighs. you fought the urge to jump or squeal when you felt his warm wet fingers thread through your folds.   he let out a sigh of discontent before glancing up to your face.   “trust me alright?” he asked.   you didn’t verbally respond. you simply looked at him with your lips slightly parted eventually nodding.   that was enough for him. he climbed down the length of your body settling himself between your legs. he raised the length of your shift up to your stomach leaving your bare from the abdomen down. in your nervous state you took it as a cue to slip your dress off. when he saw the cool air hit your naked breasts and harden your nipples into a peak his own lips parted — and you felt a growing mass harden against your leg.   “you’re beautiful wife” he spoke — seemingly without realizing it. you almost thanked him before he added “…for a bracken.”   you narrowed your eyes at him ready to respond — when he dipped below your navel.   you sucked in a sharp breath of surprise — you couldn’t help it.   his tongue licked up and down the length of your slit and dove in between your folds. you immediately covered your mouth with your hand all of your muscles going tense. davos had wrapped his arms under your thighs hoisting them around his shoulders. his tongue was thick and messy against your folds causing them to glisten in the flames of the nearby fire.   and once his tongue made contact with the pearl at the very top of your slit you let out an exhale of ease. it was not lost on your husband — who drew a circle around the circumference of the bud. when he noticed you relaxed more he drew another. when he noticed you fought the urge to buck your hips up to meet his mouth he drew yet another. he knew what was happening — but he wasn’t sure if you did.   when you began to fist the sheets with your one free hand he didn’t stop drawing.   he locked his head in between your thighs with them thrown over his shoulders. your cunt was dripping juices from your sweet untouched hole — and davos found himself ashamed to admit that he lost himself in the act. for a moment he couldn’t help but forget the name of the girl above him — the one taking everything he gave her and acting so grateful with the way she couldn’t stay still.   but after that moment… he could’ve ripped away and plunged into you making the act become done and over quicker. he could’ve… but he found himself enjoying it.   he continued to draw those circles — those small tiny wet circles that sent you in a haze — as he slipped a finger inside your cunt. and then two. he was greedy for your reaction. he was greedy for the way he knew he fucking knew that you had never experienced pleasure like this — not by you or anyone else. him a blackwood would be the one to make you feel so good you would forget your name and house for even the smallest moment — even the smallest moment would be a win for his pride and for his house.   a small part of him hoped you’d feel shame at the fact he’d make you succumb to the throws of pleasure… but a larger part of him wanted to make you feel so good that you allegiance to your house wavered. …but when he began to suck on your clit sounds filling the room — he knew it would be both.   from below he watched you shove the side of your face into the pillow and pull at its threads. your hips began to ride against his face coating his chin with everything you could give him. he held you down the best he could — bratty little thing you were but it was difficult as he also wanted you to lose control. he watched as you tried to bite your lip harder and harder and harder — before you gave up. you left out a sob into the pillow legs still shaking and davos kissed your clit.   when davos crawled back up to meet you every nerve ending had pins and needles. you were warm from head to toe — no longer in need of the fire your shift or any blanket. you were shivering but not from the cold — but from the comedown a stranger to passion and lust and pleasure. all three twirled around in your womb like a fire that had never been lit; a treasure to be discovered — only by davos.   “can i kiss you?” you asked before thinking it through.   davos had a look of being caught off guard. he wasn’t expecting you to ask and you saw it flash on his face. you suddenly grew worried —   he didn’t let you finish your thought. davos leaned forward and kissed you.   he kissed you in the way you would expect a boy you love to kiss you — sweet gentle but with a growing passion that could only be shared in the bedroom. he held his weight with one of his strong arms the other tucked behind the back of your knee. he pulled your knee to his hip and you wrapped both legs around his hips. you pulled him into you and felt the skin of his pelvis brush against your cunt.   “you’re so sweet” you spoke against his lips. with obvious sarcasm you added “…for a blackwood.”   he laughed then. “you’re obedient for a bracken.”   you flicked his stomach causing him to yelp — but you didn’t let him pull away for long. with both hands you pulled him back to meet your lips. it hadn’t even crossed your mind to ask him to wipe his mouth for you did not want to. the old gods and the new would surely curse you for such lust filled thoughts — but you didn’t care. how could you care when you had found a way to bring peace between a blackwood and a bracken even if it was temporary? how could you care when you sharing one of the most holy of relationships being the intimacy between husband and wife? how could you care when this night was going better than you could have hoped?   you could sense him bring his own hand down to his large member feeling his forearm brush your thigh as he fisted his length. as much as you wanted to reach out and pleasure him — you were worried for what came next. the pain. the inevitable.   davos lined up the red tip of his cock with your tight hole barely stretched out by his fingers. he slid his cock up and down the length of your slit with the intent of collecting as much of your juices as possible. with a slight push he entered you.   you immediately let your head fall onto the pillow as the stretch began to burn. the pain on your face was evident and davos guided his hand to draw circles on your clit once more. your muscles loosened welcoming the pleasure that davos brought you.   “please” you gasped flicking your eyes up to him.   he stared at your face with an intense look of study. with his eyebrows knitted together he brought one of your legs over his lower back and held you by the back of your thigh. the stretch was felt in the length of your cunt as it stretched to fill his size.   davos was concerned for your well-being of course but something was beginning to curl in his lower abdomen. he wanted to take your by force — prying your legs open holding your thighs in place and drilling his cock into your swollen dripping cunt. he wanted you to moan his name in his ear and pull at his hair or scratch his back — but he couldn’t not yet. not just yet. not when you were you worried before especially now that your attitude had been lost.   he had half a mind to point that out — lest that return.   “keep going” you spoke.   “what if —“   “i’ll tell you to stop if it hurts” you interrupted. “it’s all felt so good — i don’t want it to stop.”   he quirked an eyebrow at you. “is my wife claiming to know more than her lord husband?”   you squinted your eyes at him ready to bite back. “i’ll have you know —“   but he didn’t wait for you to finish.   he leaned forward placing both forearms on the side of your head. you could feel his lips against your earlobe causing a quick intake of breath to overtake you. as he leaned forward to your ear his hips leaned forward as well. his large cock was fully buried inside you now rocking back and forth as it hit a spot so deep inside you that you didn’t know how he was able to fit. it felt like it was right behind your tiny pearl which was being nudged by your husband’s pelvic bone. the combination was driving you crazy only nonsense poured from your pretty lips…   “you’ll take what i give you my pretty bracken wife” he spat. “or should i say blackwood hmm? no longer craven?”   you wanted to bite back. you wanted to slap him. you wanted to push him from between you and make him finished himself off — but you couldn’t. you couldn’t fight your hips as they raised to meet his own holding still as he pounded into your pretty cunt.   “a cock made you forget where your loyalties lie?” he questioned with a scoff but never forgetting to smirk. “that’s all you need wife? no one’s ever made you feel like this before?”   “you fucking —“   “say it” he spat almost growling against your lobe. his hips were snapping against yours as your cunt milked his cock hoping for the spend that would seal the accomplishment of the marital duty. you were almost in tears from the frustration and the pleasure — not sure how to channel it not sure what to do with it. “say it!”   “no one davos” you cried into the open air above you. “only you only…”  his hands were tangled through your hair now keeping your head upright as he sucked on your neck. little nips and bites sent shockwaves throughout your body and your hips began to stir in the familiar way they had moments prior. davos’ weight held you perfectly still and taut subjecting you to the pleasure his cock brought in the most perfect way.   “bet you can’t stand that you’re buried in a bracken right now” you bit almost succumbing to tears. “— can’t stand that only my womb will give you an heir —“   he yanked on your hair then extending your neck so you were at his mercy. a strangled gasp left your mouth as you clung to him which surprised you. you once asked for gentleness kindness sweetness… but if you had known how good this would feel… you wouldn’t have even bothered. you would’ve pushed and pulled him all night — subjecting him to the same insults that he hurled towards you if it meant he would fuck you this good.   “and i’ll coat your womb in everything i have wife” he growled pushing his hand between your bodies to rub circles on your clit. “everything i have — until you’re full of blackwood seed. until there’s blackwood in your veins. a full blackwood honorable enough to give me a blackwood heir.”   “i’ll never be —“   you couldn’t finish your sentence. the combination between his large cock taking you and his skilled fingers working you… it was all too much. you couldn’t handle the pleasure and the bittersweetness of his attitude as you were already so close to your peak and losing to him. you could feel the heat rise to your cheeks as well as spreading throughout your womb… ready for him…   “davos please — “ you cried. “i’m so close. please don’t stop…”   “tell me you’re a blackwood” he spat. “say it — or i’ll stop.”   “you wouldn’t —“   “i would dare lady blackwood” he spat interrupting you. “now tell me who you belong to — or i’ll leave you unsatisfied with this pretty cunt dripping.”   he immediately began to slow down his hips and you felt his fingers begin to slow as well. you tried to fight the incessant need to have him continue but it proved difficult. soon frustration replaced pleasure. anger replaced lust. need replaced pride.   “i’m yours lord blackwood — !” you cried pulling his hips back into yours. “please —“  he didn’t let you finish. immediately his lips were on yours. he tangled your tongue with his until you could feel it down your throat. his tongue his fingers and his cock — they filled you whole leaving you wanting for nothing. he held you to still so tight that all you could do was whatever he wanted. his own hips were thrusting against yours — chasing his own pleasure while you unraveled like pretty thread.   “this tight perfect cunt…” he growled. “so many little blackwood heirs will bless this womb… seven hells…”  he kissed you once more and you felt something break inside you. your head threw itself back against the pillow as every muscle in your body tightened and stood still. a sob left your mouth incoherent — but when davos heard it heard it crying for him and only for him he broke as well. the heat and passion between two sworn enemies threw you both into climax that neither of you had ever experienced before. you pulled at his hair while he bit down on your shoulder. and there was your bond — sealed in pain pleasure and blood.   when your peak had cooled you found yourself clinging to your new husband as he still laid on top of you. he was breathing heavily having expended much energy and couldn’t bring himself

There are those who believe that to sit the throne is his birthright. They believe the realm is his for the taking. They believe that he is the rightful heir. He does not believe such things. He does not want such things.   The throne belongs to his sister.   The crown belongs to his sister.   The Seven Kingdoms will be ruled by his sister.  Not by him.   That is why he stands atop the high tower now as it pours and is not between his wife’s legs. He shivers soaked by rain when he could happily be soaking up his wife’s body heat. He closes his eyes and imagines her instead of running back to her and falling onto his knees before her.   He wants nothing more than his wife.   He wants to kiss her. He wants to hold her. He wants to taste her. He wants to smell her perfume. He wants to thread his fingers through her hair. He wants to see her cheeks redden. He wants to feel her heart pound. He wants to be inside her.   Aegon wants her belly to be round with his baby— but he can only imagine such things for he is the challenge.   He is the challenge and if he fathers children he strengthens his claim to the Iron Throne and risks supplanting Rhaenyra as their father’s Heir.   Aegon cannot allow such a thing to happen. He knows full well what will happen if his grandfather’s plots see the light of day. It’s treason. It’s immoral. It’s dangerous— and he cannot put Helaena in that much danger.   He cannot risk putting his children in that much danger.   His grandfather plans to make him a King at the cost of everything if that’s what it takes— but Aegon can’t lose everything. All he has is his wife and he won’t risk her for a crown that he doesn’t want.   He’s never wanted it. Never dreamed of it. Never strived for it. Never made any attempts at grasping it even though he could.   Aegon has never wanted the throne— he’s only ever wanted Helaena.,2024-07-13 04:02:18 GMT

Not much but just enough that the heels of her boots sank into the soil like it was sand on a beach slowly her incrementally as she ran as fast as she could through the woods. She’d begun running at sunset. It was almost fully dark now the indigo skies creating large dark shadows that seemed to mock her as she hurried past branches and jumping over babbling brooks.  This began do to a sudden unrestrained thought. Ben Blackwood had been sneering at her by the creek claiming that the rock she was sitting on was on Blackwood land and that meant she was not only trespassing but also now was Blackwood property as well while leaning down and making that stupid face at her.  It had been an idea that came so suddenly and clearly Elma could’ve done nothing else.  Once his face was within two feet of her she’d risen up her fist and socked him on the nose.  Then she’d laughed right in his pained startled face. Very quickly that surprise had turned into furious outrage so she’d had to move quickly. Elma had shoved him into the creek as hard as she could not even turning back to see him splashing against the water before she’d begun sprinting away.  And now she was running through the woods. With Bloody Ben not far behind her.  She could hear his breath and the sound of his grunts which were coming closer and closer. It was that it would take time after she ducked a branch before she heard it snap the savage Blackwood breaking the twigs off rather than take the time to dodge them as she had.  Anticipation had riled her unimaginably. Her heart was pounding in her chest she could hear every thud within her ears.  Thud thud thud. The soft upturned soil sinking and spitting out every time boots sank into it.  Elma was starting to tire her legs were protesting every movement now and her breath was becoming so loud. She was almost considering stopping letting him catch her - after all if she let him catch her it was not like he had won. She’d have just chosen to let the game end.  And it was when she was considering slowing after she’d jumped over a rather wide stream that she’d noticed it: the sudden lack of noise.  So her legs halted in place the soil making way to moss as she struggled to silence her own heaving breaths even having to cover her own mouth as she turned to look behind her.  Nothing. There was no one.  And it was no longer just dark it was black now. Night had fully fallen over her and worser now she couldn’t see Benjicot behind her. Had he stopped? Decided that she was not worth the trouble by chasing her all through the woods? And decided that actually leaving her alone with no weapon or light would be punishment enough for hitting him?  It was just as she was starting to become truly actually afraid when she heard a snap of a twig.  Elma gasped.   And then she was taken hold of and that soft soil she’d been so frustrated with cushioned her fall as she fell face first into the dirt and moss.   “Spread your fucking legs.” Ben demanded lowly into her ear.  She obeyed mindlessly out of breath from the force of his throw.  Immediately he shoved himself between her thighs pushing up her skirts from behind and pushing her small clothes out of the way with little care for her before his cock was shoved inside of her wet cunt. Then he began to fuck her. He did so hard and fast his hips hammering against her without any other preamble not even touching her any further other than merely holding her hard against the dirt.  The angle wasn’t quite right for her to feel pleasure but that didn’t seem to matter. Every thrust she became wetter and wetter until squelching noises joined Ben’s heavy grunts as he used her.  His hips soon changed the pace from hard and fast to now just hard as if he were trying to bruise her from his thrusts alone.  And he may have succeeded - as her rear was feeling more tender when he finally came inside of her his cum shooting well inside of her cunt until she could feel it spilling out.   When he pulled out of her she realized she was trembling.   Benjicot must’ve realized it too because after a few moments he laid himself against her wrapping one arm around her waist and the other loosely under her neck while he lowered his face into her hair.  The pressure felt good.  But not as good as the kiss that he pressed against the back of her hair holding her warm and safe against his body.,2024-07-13 04:50:55 GMT

What do you mean the promise dies with Jace. What do you mean he is willing to kneel for Aegon. What do you mean he would kill innocents. What do you mean he would affirm Aegon and says Rhaenyra was not the rightful heir.   Even if this wasn’t counter to Cregan specifically it is counter to the Starks in their entirety. That’s why Jon Snow choosing to break the 300 year oath was such a big deal. Did we not all read or watch the first book/season of game of thrones. Ned Stark literally knows he is likely to be killed for doing the lawful thing and still does it and does end up killed.

'.hotd'  'aegonlyzing'  'jane.posts'],ellewod,aegon’s views on sex and nudity are so interesting to me. we see in season one when he’s a teen that he clearly enjoys masturbating as many young (and older) men do. what’s interesting though is that he stands in the window frame risking to be caught/seen by someone outside. he does not only not care about the risk of being caught in this intimate situation he seems to want to provoke it.  when alicent storms into his chambers he seems somewhat embarrassed falling onto the bed and wrapping a blanket around his bare body. however he does not seem particularly surprised that she barges in unannounced and he doesn’t seem to be confused that she immediately starts talking about something else entirely — indicating alicent has caught him in this situation multiple times before.  prior to this scene in the dragonpit when they present aemond with a pig that he’s supposed to claim (instead of a dragon) aegon says “be sure to mount her carefully. first flight’s always rough”. clearly there’s a sexual innuendo to his joke. like many testosterone filled boys he enjoys making these jokes and it seems to make him feel superior to aemond who is younger therefore less experienced and has no dragon to call his own. aegon relishes the fact that he does and that he’s also more sexually experienced — even at that young age.  later in season one when we’re introduced to an older aegon where do we find him? in his bed stark naked seemingly just having raped a serving girl. again his mother barges into his chambers unannounced. again he isn’t surprised. again he doesn’t feel particularly uncomfortable for her to find him in this state. butt ass naked probably still slightly intoxicated. the wine glass isn’t placed on his nightstand by accident.   when alicent confronts him about the serving girl he says “it was just harmless fun. she didn’t need to go and get upset about it”. clearly he doesn’t grasp the harm he’s caused the girl he doesn’t particularly care. she’s a servant he thinks he’s entitled to her (sexual) services.  moving onto the dinner scene we once again witness aegon making inappropriate remarks – after eagerly emptying his wine glass. this time he voices his thoughts towards jacaerys and baela. he belittles jace by telling him “well done jace you’ll finally get to lie with a woman. you do know how the act is done i assume? at least in principle.” again he feels superior because of his experience.   then he moves onto baela and tells her “i regret the disappointment you are soon to suffer. but if you ever wish to know what it is to be well satisfied all you have to do is ask.” aegon knows he’s good at sex and satisfying women. he’s proud of it.   at the end of the season aemond states that aegon has taken him to a brothel at a very young age to lose his virginity again making a sexual remark by saying “time to get it wet”. seemingly aegon experienced something similar and wishes for his brother to no longer be “inexperienced”. he sees no harm. he truly believes it to be a necessary and a pleasant experience for aemond losing his virginity to a brothel worker twice or thrice his age.   in season two we witness a callback to that very scene. aegon — mourning heavily drunk because he cannot stand his pain without alcohol — visits a brothel with his friends. again aegon takes a young lad to this place to “help” him lose his virginity. again aegon tells the boy it’s “time to get it wet”. he doesn’t care that the boy is obviously uncomfortable. he wouldn’t understand.  then he finds aemond who lies with the same brothel worker that aegon introduced to him and paid to take aemond’s virginity. aegon laughs at aemond. partly because aegon was badly hurt by aemond’s reckless actions and wishes to humiliate him. partly because again he feels superior to aemond enjoys the feeling of being more experienced than his younger brother. he asks aemond whether he “fucked her like a hound” — a comment that’s way over the top in this situation. nobody joins aegon in his laughter he continues to laugh regardless. he knows he’s the king now nobody would dare oppose him.   aegon doesn’t shy away from nudity. upon witnessing his brother in such an intimate situation creepily similar to the situations alicent has caught aegon in he laughs. when aemond gets up and presents his bare body for all to see aegon looks slightly repulsed yet he stares directly at him yet he keeps on laughing — still trying to belittle aemond as if saying “you’re small”.   aegon is an addict. he drinks to fill a void to lessen his boredom to forget to feel something — something other than loneliness rejection the weight of failure pressing on his shoulders. besides drowning in alcohol having sex is his way of coping. it makes him feel well educated superior to those with less experience. pleasuring a woman — it’s the only thing he feels he’s actually good at. he has no boundaries he has no shame he has no compassion for those he uses for his amusement and pleasure.  it’s toxic and twisted yet insanely intriguing.,2024-07-13 07:07:58 GMT

51,House of the Dragon,['please say sike right fucking now'  'game of thrones'  'hotd'  'cregan stark'  'stark'  'house stark'],chopper-witch,I have never been more stressed about a show than hearing the leaks for Cregan’s story. What do you mean the promise dies with Jace. What do you mean he is willing to kneel for Aegon. What do you mean he would kill innocents. What do you mean he would affirm Aegon and says Rhaenyra was not the rightful heir.   Even if this wasn’t counter to Cregan specifically it is counter to the Starks in their entirety. That’s why Jon Snow choosing to break the 300 year oath was such a big deal. Did we not all read or watch the first book/season of game of thrones. Ned Stark literally knows he is likely to be killed for doing the lawful thing and still does it and does end up killed. Starks literally rather be executed than do something dishonorable.,2024-07-13 06:29:31 GMT

Like I really hope it’s just rumours and nothing else…  The Starks are and have always been ‘the goodies’ (every single people in Kingslanding knows that Starks never break their oaths - they’re loyal noble etc. and for some reason they always repeat ‘winter is coming’ even if we’re in the middle of the summer leaving people like wtf?)   Anyways. The point is that Starks would never break an oath (and as someone else pointed out Jon breaking his own oath was indeed something that impacted through the series and the storyline). So it makes sense that Cregan helps (even if it’s a little) Jace (because he respects the Oath from his father to king Viserys and Queen Rhaenyra)   it just doesn’t make sense the showrunners want to make Cregan a villain that supports Aegon - why would he accept Jace’s proposal then? I’m any case he could’ve killed him by throwing him from the Wall while his dragon wasn’t near and send a raven to Aegon or something. That’s why it was so important to show us Jace/Cregan relationship (Cregan saw him as a brother because Jace reminded him his own death brother - they even made a blood pact - something even more solemn than a oath by words)  I’m any case it makes sense Cregan being in Rhaenyra’s side and still be ruthless in The Hour of the Wolf but naming Aegon king for the history books. Here are my thoughts.   Cregan unlike Ned Stark (RIP) didn’t seem to give second chances in this part of the Dance of the Dragons because he had a different background (let’s remember Ned’s downfall was trusting Littlefinger and warning Cersei). Cregan doesn’t trust anyone because he was betrayed by his own kin (his uncle wanted to stay in the power and he had to take what was rightfully his). He sees this child (the little brother of Jace - who he considered a brother) and I bet he wants to leave him in the best hands. Yes Larys and Corlys killed Aegon but that only showed that they could change their intentions in any given moment - he definitely needed to take that from the root - I think that’s why he wanted to execute all of those that were involved in the plotting to kill Aegon II. It was the usurper but it was their king (how was Cregan supposed to trust them?)  Now about him naming Aegon II as the official king in the history… i think it was probably to calm those who were still team green and avoid them to continue the war (he even married Aegon with Jaehaera to reinforce this). At the end Aegon Rhaenyra’s son was sitting in the throne and he had to take the most strategic decisions to keep that kid safe in the first moments of his reign. Because he owed it to Jace… because he made an Oath.   Anyways let’s hope HotD doesn’t ruin Cregan and let’s see what happens…,2024-07-13 08:38:24 GMT

Algunos dragonkeepers mantienen la creencia que es este deseo de la madre lo que se trasmite a través del vínculo hacia el dragón manteniéndolo anidando durante los meses de gestación humana para que los niños que nazcan acaben teniendo un huevo con el que compartir la cuna otros creen que es a la inversa y es el calor del dragón lo que se siembra en la jinete desde el deseo primitivo de la reproducción; aunque nadie tiene alguna forma de comprobar ninguna teoría el conocimiento de los dragones era demasiado limitado en los días que corrían y si alguna vez esto había tenido respuestas encontraron su fin junto con la herencia de la antigua Valyria.  Siendo Dragonstone la cede del heredero el primer lugar al que llegaron los Targaryen por primera vez desde que dejaron su tierra destinada a la ruina la fertilidad de la princesa Rhaenyra que desembocó en la mayor cantidad de dragones en los cielos y el mayor número de huevos en las cuevas de la isla esas creencias se fortalecieron mediante murmullos de algunos maestres y dragonkeepers interesados en comprender más de la magia valyria. Murmullos que son demasiado débiles como para ir a algún lugar más allá de Dragonstone debido al desinterés y la comprensión escasa de los andalos…una pena realmente porque ahora a kilómetros de allí en Winterfell Cregan no tiene idea de por qué lo asaltaste en medio de la tarde en la sala vacía del consejo por tercera vez en la semana comenzando a montarlo de forma desesperada con tus uñas clavadas sobre sus hombros y tus tetas apretadas contra su rostro mientras continúas suplicando entre gemidos airosos lo mucho que deseas tener su semilla llenándote hasta que desborde tu coño y la sientas chorreando por tus muslos pero créeme no se esta quejando mientras sostiene tus caderas embistiendo desde abajo al compás de tus caderas.,2024-07-13 09:54:22 GMT

Everything that led to Rook’s Rest defiled your mouth with ache and bitterness. You held your high at the Black Council. Yet your composure was not restrained enough for it.  notes: obvi spoilers for s02ep04 and NO BETA READ.  The Black Council did not take Cole’s triumph very well. The usurper’s Hand now leads his army across from Duskendale to Rook’s Rest adding army men as he goes to every mainland facility. His army was getting larger as the days passed. The men of the council were quick to example their worry and anxiousness. They’ve become desperate to act to fend off these men from their allies but the Queen’s heir could not succumb to it all.   “Criston Cole is heading towards Rook’s Rest as we speak! A few miles from Dragonstone we must act quickly my lady and prince.”   “We cannot act hastily my lords” Jacaerys proclaims setting his fingertips on the black molten table of the map of Westeros. It’s enormous and corrupted in a disfigured beautiful kind of way. The candles that lit the table settle evenly as the early morrow dew calms. Today was difficult to bypass so trouts from Hightower Bracken and Lannister marched towards Rook’s Rest. And the longer the impending ticking time bomb of when the Queen returns leaves her poor boy restless.   “We are vulnerable and Cole knows it!”   “My prince.”  &lt;!-- more --&gt; “Mind yourself my lords” Your voice snaps it’s quick and stern all it should be when all eyes turn to your cold stare. Your eyes the imperfect void of anger and pent-up discomfort travel to your stance. You lean forward having your arms alongside the table grabbing the edges impatiently. “If you helped Lord Celtigar you would find your troops ready to march towards Rook’s Rest immediately. By the time your men reach the battle would’ve been fought already. A waste of troops and security for Dragonstone. Is that what you want? To have your queen weak and endangered while you lay ravaged from an imperious battle?”  People know of your infamous temper. It was inherited and familiar to your fathers Daemon. Some say you had better luck receiving Daemon’s mental rage than your late mother Laena’s consoling heart. Your two sisters had it. Yet when it came to you it was as if the gods were curious and wanted to employ more madness into the air. And though you may not have experience at war or battle you know Rhaenyra long enough to acknowledge her plans to sustain the lords. As for how long she may need you and Jacaerys must temper the council before thinking of anything rash. It’s taken you in unkind ways allowing your thoughts to speak louder than your mind.   Lord Celtigar could not muster a word. And the other lords quibbled in silence all looking around avoiding your gaze. As you feel softening eyes from your betrothed you make contact with a sense of comfort. He understands more than you how infuriating it must be to control a room full of men who don’t believe in your judgment.   Coincidently when the black chambers reappear the presence of the Black Queen becomes visible alongside Maester Gerardys. The remaining folks all welcome her arrival with respect and poise as each head bows and addresses their queen. You do the same nodding towards your now stepmother when she spots you and her eldest son in the front control of the meeting at hand. Jacaerys has a look of relief and a kind smile having known his mother is alive and well. Even Baela who was listening quietly in the corner peeked up with happiness. To finally put some sense in the room.   “What has happened?” Her own exasperated eyes spoke volumes and questions about where she had gone. Rhaenyra was dressed in unfamiliar clothing one that looked too closely to a Septa. You did not have time to reconcile it when one of the men explained their situation about the Green’s troops. It would only worsen I’m afraid Your Grace.  Luckily the Queen was tolerant in her many repetitive days of listening to old folk complain. And when asked of her whereabouts unknown to everyone she had explained that she had left Dragonstone for King’s Landing. A dangerous and impulsive act. Yet the further your stepmother explained it only sought reason with the Queen Regent and confirmation for the upcoming war. You would surely applaud her for her efforts to prevent bloodshed. If it had been you you would’ve cut that green snake by the throat.   “I had just surveyed the Riverlands Your Grace” Another voice announced to the council and your surprise your grandmother Rhaenys and grandfather Corlys Velaryon. “Cole’s army marches and plans to invade Lord Staunton’s land.”   “But why? Rook’s Rest is but a small castle.” It’s odd really why would a large group of fourteen or fifteen hundred invade a nearby castle that barely stood on its backbones? However one explanation was to conclude they wanted to invade nearby Houses by Dragonstone. “After Duskendale…:  “Cole knows Lord Staunton is a part of the Council he wants to cut down our alliances”   “We must send dragons Your Grace!”   “No!” A shrill so quickly after what had haunted her dreams Rhaenyra’s heartbeats doubled its tempo. The threat was too close to Dragonstone sending a dragon would shorten the time to get there. However she did not know of the consequences that would bestow on her men and supporters. Would send a dragon to shift the balance of the war?  “Send me Mother” Jacaerys confidently volunteers his chest rising with the determination and privilege for his mother to see. He is ready. He wants to prove his worth and duty to protect his mother and family. “Let me deal with Cole and his troops”  You don’t comment on anything. You respect Jacaerys for his courage yet you felt a bad gut feeling about the whole ordeal. You were careful to observe the moves both sides depicted and Rook’s Rest felt uneasy to send reinforcements for. A dragon would do damage but what if it was a trap?  “You lack the experience” Her command echoes with emphasis her gaze falling onto each dragon rider in the room. And when it meets your longing stare it felt as though she was about to indulge. To ask you sacrifice you to do it. However it was Rhaenys who volunteered.   “I shall go to Rook’s Rest Your Grace” Your grandmother was nothing of the soft. She is vicious in her flying and dragon-similar fashion. Meleys is one of the biggest dragons you have on your side and would be a formidable alley to use upon a small garrison among the Riverlands. Your grandmother is strong-headed and has seen battles far longer than you. Therefore you hope in your gut and heart she makes it out breathing and alive.  When the meeting is dismissed you can’t help but want to ease the pain as quickly as possible. The last few nights have made you tired and delirious. Your father flew back on Caraxes and disappeared without a note. You had no clue when he would return but knew he and Rhaenyra were not on terms with each other currently. Did it make you upset had he not said anything? Not send word of his whereabouts to you? His daughter? The one he oh so laughed and smiled with when training to fly. The one who taught the ways of the sword to you on the sandy beaches by Dragonstone. Who chased you down the halls when you were little in Pentos when every hall was filled with books and novels that even cobwebs could not distract from?  Most importantly you were hurt by your father. You knew he was not a good man yet for the time he was present as a father he had taught and treated you well to remember. His time with your late mother Laena was brought up short and in time his need to spend time with you and your sisters. They both felt it you did as well. It’s frustrating to see as a child to see your father dismiss you like flies. That you are not as important as you thought to be in his life. But you have moved on from that life and kept your distance from him.   Your stepmother on the other hand was a apart of third of your life. She had become the replacement for your mother. You did not deny it because it was bound to happen sooner or later. Rhaenyra did not treat you warmly as her daughter. However you felt the care and giving she had for you and your sisters. You were a part of Daemon’s life therefore she respected you. You did not treat her like a mother because she had five others to take care of. Most of the time you visited Driftmark then and spent time with Baela and your grandparents.   And to your betrothed it was a natural thing to accept. He was the queen’s heir and you the king’s consort eldest. As fitting the two of you resembled much of your parents when paired together.   “What was your father like?” Your concentration was not focused on his pattering breath. He staggered his way up to you on the highest cliff nearest to the dragon pit. Above anything it gives you a beautiful view of the ocean and a tease of the Narrow Sea. Its fluorescent color glows warmly in contrast with the sea’s cool tones. The beating drum of the waves is what you focus on. As the brunette-haired prince closes his mouth in thought.   “He was fierce. And had a gentle heart” The prince prompts fondly. It felt like ages ago he had witnessed Harwin Strong alive and walking upon the Red Keep when he was little. The way he cared for the boys Jacaerys would always remember and cherish what his biological father meant to his mother. “They called him Breakbones.”   A pleased smirk rested on your lips. “Breakbones” You enunciate slowly. Jacaerys turns and grins for the playfulness bestowed. In many reflections you resembled much of the Rogue Prince and he of the Black Queen. The slightest similarities yet you both carried a different drive that your parents inherited. It’s difficult to think about for the past few days you have been thinking of your father. How he was doing and his plans furthering with Harrenhal.   In a certain light the Queen’s heir can decipher you. You worry for Daemon. You’re aware of how persuasive he can be with or without Caraxes. Your father was a known warrior who held victory in the Stepstones. He would risk his life for the Queen no doubt. Yet what struck the most eminent was his ambitious rage. No one could detain him.  “Have you had any news from Daemon?” Your betrothed rests his arms on top of one another when a gust of wind floats past you. It doesn’t bother you yet you relish in the breeze and cold. You close your eyes for a moment to feel the immersion of the Blackwater Sea surrounding you.   “No” A sombrous frown leaves on Jacaerys. He knows how much you love and look up to your father. You were alike sharing alarming motivations for war and violence. The only thing that separated you from becoming the next example of the Rogue Prince was your hesitation to do it all. You never had to experience war before. You have never witnessed a battle between men before. He wonders that at the end of this triumph would you elevate towards the same blood lust as your father has? “He hasn’t sent a single raven. But I know he is at Harrenhal the lords sent word of it.”   The prince’s brown gaze catches your drooped pout and the fiddling of your lace sleeves. Dragonstone is wet and cold. Even though it is known as the regal home of his family it’s a paradox of how treacherous it is to outsiders. From the black stones carved into the castle and classical carvings of Valyria Dragonstone holds a menacing name in the realm.   You continue to twist the loose threads of your regal war garments. It acts also as dragon riding attire fine crimson and obsidian leather cultured of your House colors. Silver charms drape from shoulder to shoulder with a pin of a dragon by the ends. “He will return” Your prince mumbles as you feel him glancing at your fragile palms. Soft and delicate with a lack of scars and injury. You feel a sudden urge to peck at him. “Daemon won’t be away for long.”   “Course’ not” You smooth one hand over the other one last time before facing Jacaerys. His figure was still faced forward and beyond to the sea. But his focus his attention was solely on you. “When he comes back Harrenhal would be taken care of and in disposal for the Queen.” You smile at the thought of your father returning to Dragonstone. The air would feel different. And surely more tension and looks of weary would come.   Jacaerys shares the same sentiments. He grins as well to where the wind picks up and flicks his hair away from his face. The sunset never fails to amaze him of the beauty of home. Where Dragonstone he had lived here for half of his life. It’s the sights you can never see from King’s Landing or any other island. But then he picks up you trudging down the cliff holding part of your shirt for a safe escape. “I-”  In the solace of the air and your gentle features the crowned prince is almost taken aback. And in the months of his mother’s proposal to you he thinks he’s finally accepted the offer.   “Walk with me?”  Rhaenys was preparing for her departure from Dragonstone to Rook’s Rests. She readjusted her gloves and lockets one last time before making her way to the dragon cave. She had already said her farewells to her husband most notably trust in her efforts. They gave each other a longing kiss and held each other before the princess left Corly’s arms. Whatever she was prepared for Rhaenys understood what war would be like. Meleys is an experienced dragon she has seen these horrors before and hopes she escapes this with a victory.   “Grandmother!”   Her trouts slow down. In front of her the Red Queen Meleys moons and purrs at the image of her rider. A few Valyrian dragon keepers are seen fastening the saddle and ropes alongside her belly. Rhaenys glances aback and sweetly meets the image of her eldest granddaughter.   She murmurs your name before crashing into a tender embrace. Your head snuggles in the crescent of her neck as her chin sits on top of your head. A pleasant moment of silence before you break the mend and give a wry smile. You look so much like Laena sometimes she could not speak of it. Oh her daughter you held her image so fondly. It suited you in light as she caressed your forearms holding them in place.   “I wish you a fair journey” You breathed out the words. Absent of any worry she saw what her other two granddaughters had for her. You believed in Rhaenys in her strength and that she would come out victorious. She had to. “May you burn all of Cole’s troops and bring back Lord Staunton safely.”  “Yes a pity for Lord Staunton’s men I’m afraid” She mumbles which brings a conniving smirk. You both knew full well that the outcome of Rook Rests would end in flames. Many men will die. To be burnt and slaughtered by Meleys rightfully so. But also for the stubborn garrison Lord Staunton has against his small tavern home. Though it was not something to joke about the two of you carried that kind of sense of humor anywhere. “And I assure you my granddaughter I will come back safely.”  “You will” A flash of a different emotion on your face. Determination. There is no mistaking your fierce belief in Rhaenys efforts she taught you how to fly your dragon. She will prevail in battle. “Meleys is capable of many things but you are her rider the one who controls the Red Queen.”  “And well said” She gives you a playful look before a shriek from her dragon pushes all attention to Meleys. She growls almost excitedly awaiting for her rider knowing what the battle is to come. She even looks at you. You stare at her before the voice of your grandmother piques your interest. “And I do hope your sentiments for that boy are long forgotten knowing what comes after this war.”  The look you give to her said it all. Your eyes widen slightly before softening. It was as if you felt remorse for her words yet had come to reconcile with it in the end. There was no other choice. You swallowed whatever pride you had and simply nodded to receive an understanding from your grandmother.   You hadn’t anticipated the attraction. Yet now in the middle of a war you understood his intentions. Many weeks ago you wouldn’t have. It felt as though the king’s death had affected all concepts of time. What felt like it happened a month ago. You did not want to forget the night you came to King’s Landing for the first time in many. Since the death of your mother your father has been adamant about staying close to Dragonstone and Rhaenyra. You temporarily stayed with your grandparents in Driftmark with Baela. Afterwards it became your indefinite home.   “You know how the deed is done yes?” The night was tiresome and the King returned to his chambers drunk on milk of the poppy. There was a sort of tension and awkwardness in the air. And nothing beats the embarrassing conversation your cousin was trying to make with your betrothed Jacaerys. The second child of Viserys Aegon slurs his words as he eyes down at your side who sat on the other side of his nephew.   The brunette-haired prince clears his throat as though trying to ease the uncomfortable manner he has been put upon. While you did no such thing and merely continued to look at Aegon with a curious glimmer. Was it wrong to be intrigued by such stupidity?   And in the corner of your eye his younger brother Aemond mounts his cup to his lips. He does it carefully and slowly all while giving his attention to you and your actions. You truly were an anomaly to him. Having the King’s brother as a father. He’s amazed by your careless nature and fire. But he also sees your mother’s spirit light and gentle like fire lilies that glow in the dark. You’re a mischievous little thing and when you were younger perhaps he did favor your company over his nephews and your sisters.   “Princess” In the courtyard of the Red Keep Aemond seeks you out of the blue. Nearly before the hearing for the discussion of the heir for Driftmark you decide to explore the castle grounds more thoroughly. It has been a long time since you have visited King’s Landing. It was never your home you did not have a place to call one for a long time. From being born in Pentos to traveling to Driftmark you had suspicions about where your heart lay. “Welcome to King’s Landing”  “Ah my prince” With a tightened smile and clasped hands you greet the fourth child of King Viserys. Indeed you don’t like proper customs but you try to comply when it is needed. “It has been a long time.”  “Six years” He replies. Oddly he remembers vividly your last encounter all the way back to Driftmark to your mother’s funeral. However that was the last time he spoke to you in person. “The years have treated you well.” A heedful compliment that makes you look at him in surprise. There is no denying the shock on your face as if mocking him for his frankness. Truly you don’t take anything seriously.   “And the years have made you more refined” You hum pleasantly with no decency to prevent yourself from looking at him up and down. It almost makes the one-eyed prince laugh at your rudeness. No princess or lady could look him straight in the eye. He is horrendous in their eyes. All the while stirring some fantasy he is a knight in shining armor. He is the second son the mysterious and quiet one who is good with the sword and all sorts that his brother could not. Rather it seemed with you you did not care for his reputation.   “It has been a long time since you came to King’s Landing yes?” Aemond mumbles inviting you to take a walk with him through the gardens. You reluctantly accepted and kept the steady he held. His arms crossed behind his back as if wanting to observe you.   “King’s Landing was never close to me as it is to it being your home” You shrugged mindlessly trailing your pretty little fingers down the array of flowers and roses. Everything was in bloom all the powerful colors popped with color. It looked like spring had arrived with the most extravagant tones of red white and yellow flourishing. “My home resides by the sea and waters of Driftmark. Even though I have no taste for ships or its throne” Again you pluck a small dandelion pure of white and feathery innocence. You lightly touch it separating all the little spindles into the air.   “I doubt you will inherit Driftmark even if you had no set desire for it” He says. You never desired your grandfather’s place it was meant for a second son Lucerys.   “Perhaps in this life I will marry a handsome lord with many lands” You give a sarcastic pout avoiding your cousin’s glance at you. You can tell he’s curious. “My father seemed desperate to marry Rhaenyra after the death of my mother. I’m at my disposal for him to throw away. Why should he make the decisions when I can already be wasting away and producing children?”  Ah there it is. You’re upset more angry at your father. More importantly hurt by the actions of taking a wife so early after the passing of his previous one. Strangely it makes his heart beat faster when you explain you should’ve married by now. Young girls would rather find their prince charming or deny all suitors for their rebellious nature. However you seem to want a husband for a stable life and ultimately avoid your father altogether.   “You will find your husband soon enough” Aemond quivers with a short smile before avoiding your gaze. Suddenly it’s as if you were seeing him for the first time again. His hair was smooth and long behind his shoulders. Without a hair out of place and his face aligned and sharp. With the eye patch over his injured eye that somehow makes him more handsome.   “How do you know?” You challenged him disrupting your walk and looking straight at him. Your eyes stern and alluring attract him drawing him into your trance. Your features could not help but make him seek out more of you.   “I simply know” The one-eyed prince whispers merely inches away from your face. His breath is hot against your presence as he knows you enjoy the mystery the unknown of his words.  The world came crashing down for you when news of your grandmother arrived. You could not slip out a cry or tear. Rhaenyra and like many other of the councilmen were stunned at their loss. Star-stricken with anger and rage a bumbling flame emerged from your chest. And when your stepmother went to nudge you for comfort you merely passed by her without a care. Your shoulders bumped against each other as you rushed out of the Black Council in tears and a deeper desire.   You made your way to the dragon pits. Your dragon Sheepstealer chirps at your approach as the rest of the servants scatter for your departure. It would be a quick departure. Even as you heard the shouts and yells of Rhaenyra and the nobles for you to come back you did not care. The Greens whoever defeated your grandmother was going to die. Even now as you pat the jugular throat of your dragon Sheepstealer knows what you plan to do. Your bond allows him to know to do so.   An exclamation of your name echoes a few feet behind. Jacaerys runs towards you before Sheepstealer the mud-brown beast hums territorially at his proximity. You can’t do this!  “But I can” A quiet sniffle escapes your throat when you climb onto Sheepstealer’s back and saddle. There was possibly no stopping you from what you were about to do. Not even the Queen’s command could make you. The prince lets out an agitated sigh looking down. Before his brown eyes meet your dragon pleading for you to stay. “Rise Sheepstealer.”  You were so much like him it makes Jacaerys terrified of what you plan to do.   To Harrenhal.,2024-07-13 09:13:36 GMT

Like I really hope it’s just rumours and nothing else…  The Starks are and have always been ‘the goodies’ (every single people in Kingslanding knows that Starks never break their oaths - they’re loyal noble etc. and for some reason they always repeat ‘winter is coming’ even if we’re in the middle of the summer leaving people like wtf?)   Anyways. The point is that Starks would never break an oath (and as someone else pointed out Jon breaking his own oath was indeed something that impacted through the series and the storyline). So it makes sense that Cregan helps (even if it’s a little) Jace (because he respects the Oath from his father to king Viserys and Queen Rhaenyra)   it just doesn’t make sense the showrunners want to make Cregan a villain that supports Aegon - why would he accept Jace’s proposal then? I’m any case he could’ve killed him by throwing him from the Wall while his dragon wasn’t near and send a raven to Aegon or something. That’s why it was so important to show us Jace/Cregan relationship (Cregan saw him as a brother because Jace reminded him his own death brother - they even made a blood pact - something even more solemn than a oath by words)  I’m any case it makes sense Cregan being in Rhaenyra’s side and still be ruthless in The Hour of the Wolf but naming Aegon king for the history books. Here are my thoughts.   Cregan unlike Ned Stark (RIP) didn’t seem to give second chances in this part of the Dance of the Dragons because he had a different background (let’s remember Ned’s downfall was trusting Littlefinger and warning Cersei). Cregan doesn’t trust anyone because he was betrayed by his own kin (his uncle wanted to stay in the power and he had to take what was rightfully his). He sees this child (the little brother of Jace - who he considered a brother) and I bet he wants to leave him in the best hands. Yes Larys and Corlys killed Aegon but that only showed that they could change their intentions in any given moment - he definitely needed to take that from the root - I think that’s why he wanted to execute all of those that were involved in the plotting to kill Aegon II. It was the usurper but it was their king (how was Cregan supposed to trust them?)  Now about him naming Aegon II as the official king in the history… i think it was probably to calm those who were still team green and avoid them to continue the war (he even married Aegon with Jaehaera to reinforce this). At the end Aegon Rhaenyra’s son was sitting in the throne and he had to take the most strategic decisions to keep that kid safe in the first moments of his reign. Because he owed it to Jace… because he made an Oath.   Anyways let’s hope HotD doesn’t ruin Cregan and let’s see what happens…,2024-07-13 08:38:24 GMT

Why would making dragons more colorful and vibrant be considered too unrealistic in a show set in a fantasy world that has magic prophecies giants ice zombies etc?

Algunos dragonkeepers mantienen la creencia que es este deseo de la madre lo que se trasmite a través del vínculo hacia el dragón manteniéndolo anidando durante los meses de gestación humana para que los niños que nazcan acaben teniendo un huevo con el que compartir la cuna otros creen que es a la inversa y es el calor del dragón lo que se siembra en la jinete desde el deseo primitivo de la reproducción; aunque nadie tiene alguna forma de comprobar ninguna teoría el conocimiento de los dragones era demasiado limitado en los días que corrían y si alguna vez esto había tenido respuestas encontraron su fin junto con la herencia de la antigua Valyria.  Siendo Dragonstone la cede del heredero el primer lugar al que llegaron los Targaryen por primera vez desde que dejaron su tierra destinada a la ruina la fertilidad de la princesa Rhaenyra que desembocó en la mayor cantidad de dragones en los cielos y el mayor número de huevos en las cuevas de la isla esas creencias se fortalecieron mediante murmullos de algunos maestres y dragonkeepers interesados en comprender más de la magia valyria. Murmullos que son demasiado débiles como para ir a algún lugar más allá de Dragonstone debido al desinterés y la comprensión escasa de los andalos…una pena realmente porque ahora a kilómetros de allí en Winterfell Cregan no tiene idea de por qué lo asaltaste en medio de la tarde en la sala vacía del consejo por tercera vez en la semana comenzando a montarlo de forma desesperada con tus uñas clavadas sobre sus hombros y tus tetas apretadas contra su rostro mientras continúas suplicando entre gemidos airosos lo mucho que deseas tener su semilla llenándote hasta que desborde tu coño y la sientas chorreando por tus muslos pero créeme no se esta quejando mientras sostiene tus caderas embistiendo desde abajo al compás de tus caderas.,2024-07-13 09:54:22 GMT

Everything that led to Rook’s Rest defiled your mouth with ache and bitterness. You held your high at the Black Council. Yet your composure was not restrained enough for it.  notes: obvi spoilers for s02ep04 and NO BETA READ.  The Black Council did not take Cole’s triumph very well. The usurper’s Hand now leads his army across from Duskendale to Rook’s Rest adding army men as he goes to every mainland facility. His army was getting larger as the days passed. The men of the council were quick to example their worry and anxiousness. They’ve become desperate to act to fend off these men from their allies but the Queen’s heir could not succumb to it all.   “Criston Cole is heading towards Rook’s Rest as we speak! A few miles from Dragonstone we must act quickly my lady and prince.”   “We cannot act hastily my lords” Jacaerys proclaims setting his fingertips on the black molten table of the map of Westeros. It’s enormous and corrupted in a disfigured beautiful kind of way. The candles that lit the table settle evenly as the early morrow dew calms. Today was difficult to bypass so trouts from Hightower Bracken and Lannister marched towards Rook’s Rest. And the longer the impending ticking time bomb of when the Queen returns leaves her poor boy restless.   “We are vulnerable and Cole knows it!”   “My prince.”  &lt;!-- more --&gt; “Mind yourself my lords” Your voice snaps it’s quick and stern all it should be when all eyes turn to your cold stare. Your eyes the imperfect void of anger and pent-up discomfort travel to your stance. You lean forward having your arms alongside the table grabbing the edges impatiently. “If you helped Lord Celtigar you would find your troops ready to march towards Rook’s Rest immediately. By the time your men reach the battle would’ve been fought already. A waste of troops and security for Dragonstone. Is that what you want? To have your queen weak and endangered while you lay ravaged from an imperious battle?”  People know of your infamous temper. It was inherited and familiar to your fathers Daemon. Some say you had better luck receiving Daemon’s mental rage than your late mother Laena’s consoling heart. Your two sisters had it. Yet when it came to you it was as if the gods were curious and wanted to employ more madness into the air. And though you may not have experience at war or battle you know Rhaenyra long enough to acknowledge her plans to sustain the lords. As for how long she may need you and Jacaerys must temper the council before thinking of anything rash. It’s taken you in unkind ways allowing your thoughts to speak louder than your mind.   Lord Celtigar could not muster a word. And the other lords quibbled in silence all looking around avoiding your gaze. As you feel softening eyes from your betrothed you make contact with a sense of comfort. He understands more than you how infuriating it must be to control a room full of men who don’t believe in your judgment.   Coincidently when the black chambers reappear the presence of the Black Queen becomes visible alongside Maester Gerardys. The remaining folks all welcome her arrival with respect and poise as each head bows and addresses their queen. You do the same nodding towards your now stepmother when she spots you and her eldest son in the front control of the meeting at hand. Jacaerys has a look of relief and a kind smile having known his mother is alive and well. Even Baela who was listening quietly in the corner peeked up with happiness. To finally put some sense in the room.   “What has happened?” Her own exasperated eyes spoke volumes and questions about where she had gone. Rhaenyra was dressed in unfamiliar clothing one that looked too closely to a Septa. You did not have time to reconcile it when one of the men explained their situation about the Green’s troops. It would only worsen I’m afraid Your Grace.  Luckily the Queen was tolerant in her many repetitive days of listening to old folk complain. And when asked of her whereabouts unknown to everyone she had explained that she had left Dragonstone for King’s Landing. A dangerous and impulsive act. Yet the further your stepmother explained it only sought reason with the Queen Regent and confirmation for the upcoming war. You would surely applaud her for her efforts to prevent bloodshed. If it had been you you would’ve cut that green snake by the throat.   “I had just surveyed the Riverlands Your Grace” Another voice announced to the council and your surprise your grandmother Rhaenys and grandfather Corlys Velaryon. “Cole’s army marches and plans to invade Lord Staunton’s land.”   “But why? Rook’s Rest is but a small castle.” It’s odd really why would a large group of fourteen or fifteen hundred invade a nearby castle that barely stood on its backbones? However one explanation was to conclude they wanted to invade nearby Houses by Dragonstone. “After Duskendale…:  “Cole knows Lord Staunton is a part of the Council he wants to cut down our alliances”   “We must send dragons Your Grace!”   “No!” A shrill so quickly after what had haunted her dreams Rhaenyra’s heartbeats doubled its tempo. The threat was too close to Dragonstone sending a dragon would shorten the time to get there. However she did not know of the consequences that would bestow on her men and supporters. Would send a dragon to shift the balance of the war?  “Send me Mother” Jacaerys confidently volunteers his chest rising with the determination and privilege for his mother to see. He is ready. He wants to prove his worth and duty to protect his mother and family. “Let me deal with Cole and his troops”  You don’t comment on anything. You respect Jacaerys for his courage yet you felt a bad gut feeling about the whole ordeal. You were careful to observe the moves both sides depicted and Rook’s Rest felt uneasy to send reinforcements for. A dragon would do damage but what if it was a trap?  “You lack the experience” Her command echoes with emphasis her gaze falling onto each dragon rider in the room. And when it meets your longing stare it felt as though she was about to indulge. To ask you sacrifice you to do it. However it was Rhaenys who volunteered.   “I shall go to Rook’s Rest Your Grace” Your grandmother was nothing of the soft. She is vicious in her flying and dragon-similar fashion. Meleys is one of the biggest dragons you have on your side and would be a formidable alley to use upon a small garrison among the Riverlands. Your grandmother is strong-headed and has seen battles far longer than you. Therefore you hope in your gut and heart she makes it out breathing and alive.  When the meeting is dismissed you can’t help but want to ease the pain as quickly as possible. The last few nights have made you tired and delirious. Your father flew back on Caraxes and disappeared without a note. You had no clue when he would return but knew he and Rhaenyra were not on terms with each other currently. Did it make you upset had he not said anything? Not send word of his whereabouts to you? His daughter? The one he oh so laughed and smiled with when training to fly. The one who taught the ways of the sword to you on the sandy beaches by Dragonstone. Who chased you down the halls when you were little in Pentos when every hall was filled with books and novels that even cobwebs could not distract from?  Most importantly you were hurt by your father. You knew he was not a good man yet for the time he was present as a father he had taught and treated you well to remember. His time with your late mother Laena was brought up short and in time his need to spend time with you and your sisters. They both felt it you did as well. It’s frustrating to see as a child to see your father dismiss you like flies. That you are not as important as you thought to be in his life. But you have moved on from that life and kept your distance from him.   Your stepmother on the other hand was a apart of third of your life. She had become the replacement for your mother. You did not deny it because it was bound to happen sooner or later. Rhaenyra did not treat you warmly as her daughter. However you felt the care and giving she had for you and your sisters. You were a part of Daemon’s life therefore she respected you. You did not treat her like a mother because she had five others to take care of. Most of the time you visited Driftmark then and spent time with Baela and your grandparents.   And to your betrothed it was a natural thing to accept. He was the queen’s heir and you the king’s consort eldest. As fitting the two of you resembled much of your parents when paired together.   “What was your father like?” Your concentration was not focused on his pattering breath. He staggered his way up to you on the highest cliff nearest to the dragon pit. Above anything it gives you a beautiful view of the ocean and a tease of the Narrow Sea. Its fluorescent color glows warmly in contrast with the sea’s cool tones. The beating drum of the waves is what you focus on. As the brunette-haired prince closes his mouth in thought.   “He was fierce. And had a gentle heart” The prince prompts fondly. It felt like ages ago he had witnessed Harwin Strong alive and walking upon the Red Keep when he was little. The way he cared for the boys Jacaerys would always remember and cherish what his biological father meant to his mother. “They called him Breakbones.”   A pleased smirk rested on your lips. “Breakbones” You enunciate slowly. Jacaerys turns and grins for the playfulness bestowed. In many reflections you resembled much of the Rogue Prince and he of the Black Queen. The slightest similarities yet you both carried a different drive that your parents inherited. It’s difficult to think about for the past few days you have been thinking of your father. How he was doing and his plans furthering with Harrenhal.   In a certain light the Queen’s heir can decipher you. You worry for Daemon. You’re aware of how persuasive he can be with or without Caraxes. Your father was a known warrior who held victory in the Stepstones. He would risk his life for the Queen no doubt. Yet what struck the most eminent was his ambitious rage. No one could detain him.  “Have you had any news from Daemon?” Your betrothed rests his arms on top of one another when a gust of wind floats past you. It doesn’t bother you yet you relish in the breeze and cold. You close your eyes for a moment to feel the immersion of the Blackwater Sea surrounding you.   “No” A sombrous frown leaves on Jacaerys. He knows how much you love and look up to your father. You were alike sharing alarming motivations for war and violence. The only thing that separated you from becoming the next example of the Rogue Prince was your hesitation to do it all. You never had to experience war before. You have never witnessed a battle between men before. He wonders that at the end of this triumph would you elevate towards the same blood lust as your father has? “He hasn’t sent a single raven. But I know he is at Harrenhal the lords sent word of it.”   The prince’s brown gaze catches your drooped pout and the fiddling of your lace sleeves. Dragonstone is wet and cold. Even though it is known as the regal home of his family it’s a paradox of how treacherous it is to outsiders. From the black stones carved into the castle and classical carvings of Valyria Dragonstone holds a menacing name in the realm.   You continue to twist the loose threads of your regal war garments. It acts also as dragon riding attire fine crimson and obsidian leather cultured of your House colors. Silver charms drape from shoulder to shoulder with a pin of a dragon by the ends. “He will return” Your prince mumbles as you feel him glancing at your fragile palms. Soft and delicate with a lack of scars and injury. You feel a sudden urge to peck at him. “Daemon won’t be away for long.”   “Course’ not” You smooth one hand over the other one last time before facing Jacaerys. His figure was still faced forward and beyond to the sea. But his focus his attention was solely on you. “When he comes back Harrenhal would be taken care of and in disposal for the Queen.” You smile at the thought of your father returning to Dragonstone. The air would feel different. And surely more tension and looks of weary would come.   Jacaerys shares the same sentiments. He grins as well to where the wind picks up and flicks his hair away from his face. The sunset never fails to amaze him of the beauty of home. Where Dragonstone he had lived here for half of his life. It’s the sights you can never see from King’s Landing or any other island. But then he picks up you trudging down the cliff holding part of your shirt for a safe escape. “I-”  In the solace of the air and your gentle features the crowned prince is almost taken aback. And in the months of his mother’s proposal to you he thinks he’s finally accepted the offer.   “Walk with me?”  Rhaenys was preparing for her departure from Dragonstone to Rook’s Rests. She readjusted her gloves and lockets one last time before making her way to the dragon cave. She had already said her farewells to her husband most notably trust in her efforts. They gave each other a longing kiss and held each other before the princess left Corly’s arms. Whatever she was prepared for Rhaenys understood what war would be like. Meleys is an experienced dragon she has seen these horrors before and hopes she escapes this with a victory.   “Grandmother!”   Her trouts slow down. In front of her the Red Queen Meleys moons and purrs at the image of her rider. A few Valyrian dragon keepers are seen fastening the saddle and ropes alongside her belly. Rhaenys glances aback and sweetly meets the image of her eldest granddaughter.   She murmurs your name before crashing into a tender embrace. Your head snuggles in the crescent of her neck as her chin sits on top of your head. A pleasant moment of silence before you break the mend and give a wry smile. You look so much like Laena sometimes she could not speak of it. Oh her daughter you held her image so fondly. It suited you in light as she caressed your forearms holding them in place.   “I wish you a fair journey” You breathed out the words. Absent of any worry she saw what her other two granddaughters had for her. You believed in Rhaenys in her strength and that she would come out victorious. She had to. “May you burn all of Cole’s troops and bring back Lord Staunton safely.”  “Yes a pity for Lord Staunton’s men I’m afraid” She mumbles which brings a conniving smirk. You both knew full well that the outcome of Rook Rests would end in flames. Many men will die. To be burnt and slaughtered by Meleys rightfully so. But also for the stubborn garrison Lord Staunton has against his small tavern home. Though it was not something to joke about the two of you carried that kind of sense of humor anywhere. “And I assure you my granddaughter I will come back safely.”  “You will” A flash of a different emotion on your face. Determination. There is no mistaking your fierce belief in Rhaenys efforts she taught you how to fly your dragon. She will prevail in battle. “Meleys is capable of many things but you are her rider the one who controls the Red Queen.”  “And well said” She gives you a playful look before a shriek from her dragon pushes all attention to Meleys. She growls almost excitedly awaiting for her rider knowing what the battle is to come. She even looks at you. You stare at her before the voice of your grandmother piques your interest. “And I do hope your sentiments for that boy are long forgotten knowing what comes after this war.”  The look you give to her said it all. Your eyes widen slightly before softening. It was as if you felt remorse for her words yet had come to reconcile with it in the end. There was no other choice. You swallowed whatever pride you had and simply nodded to receive an understanding from your grandmother.   You hadn’t anticipated the attraction. Yet now in the middle of a war you understood his intentions. Many weeks ago you wouldn’t have. It felt as though the king’s death had affected all concepts of time. What felt like it happened a month ago. You did not want to forget the night you came to King’s Landing for the first time in many. Since the death of your mother your father has been adamant about staying close to Dragonstone and Rhaenyra. You temporarily stayed with your grandparents in Driftmark with Baela. Afterwards it became your indefinite home.   “You know how the deed is done yes?” The night was tiresome and the King returned to his chambers drunk on milk of the poppy. There was a sort of tension and awkwardness in the air. And nothing beats the embarrassing conversation your cousin was trying to make with your betrothed Jacaerys. The second child of Viserys Aegon slurs his words as he eyes down at your side who sat on the other side of his nephew.   The brunette-haired prince clears his throat as though trying to ease the uncomfortable manner he has been put upon. While you did no such thing and merely continued to look at Aegon with a curious glimmer. Was it wrong to be intrigued by such stupidity?   And in the corner of your eye his younger brother Aemond mounts his cup to his lips. He does it carefully and slowly all while giving his attention to you and your actions. You truly were an anomaly to him. Having the King’s brother as a father. He’s amazed by your careless nature and fire. But he also sees your mother’s spirit light and gentle like fire lilies that glow in the dark. You’re a mischievous little thing and when you were younger perhaps he did favor your company over his nephews and your sisters.   “Princess” In the courtyard of the Red Keep Aemond seeks you out of the blue. Nearly before the hearing for the discussion of the heir for Driftmark you decide to explore the castle grounds more thoroughly. It has been a long time since you have visited King’s Landing. It was never your home you did not have a place to call one for a long time. From being born in Pentos to traveling to Driftmark you had suspicions about where your heart lay. “Welcome to King’s Landing”  “Ah my prince” With a tightened smile and clasped hands you greet the fourth child of King Viserys. Indeed you don’t like proper customs but you try to comply when it is needed. “It has been a long time.”  “Six years” He replies. Oddly he remembers vividly your last encounter all the way back to Driftmark to your mother’s funeral. However that was the last time he spoke to you in person. “The years have treated you well.” A heedful compliment that makes you look at him in surprise. There is no denying the shock on your face as if mocking him for his frankness. Truly you don’t take anything seriously.   “And the years have made you more refined” You hum pleasantly with no decency to prevent yourself from looking at him up and down. It almost makes the one-eyed prince laugh at your rudeness. No princess or lady could look him straight in the eye. He is horrendous in their eyes. All the while stirring some fantasy he is a knight in shining armor. He is the second son the mysterious and quiet one who is good with the sword and all sorts that his brother could not. Rather it seemed with you you did not care for his reputation.   “It has been a long time since you came to King’s Landing yes?” Aemond mumbles inviting you to take a walk with him through the gardens. You reluctantly accepted and kept the steady he held. His arms crossed behind his back as if wanting to observe you.   “King’s Landing was never close to me as it is to it being your home” You shrugged mindlessly trailing your pretty little fingers down the array of flowers and roses. Everything was in bloom all the powerful colors popped with color. It looked like spring had arrived with the most extravagant tones of red white and yellow flourishing. “My home resides by the sea and waters of Driftmark. Even though I have no taste for ships or its throne” Again you pluck a small dandelion pure of white and feathery innocence. You lightly touch it separating all the little spindles into the air.   “I doubt you will inherit Driftmark even if you had no set desire for it” He says. You never desired your grandfather’s place it was meant for a second son Lucerys.   “Perhaps in this life I will marry a handsome lord with many lands” You give a sarcastic pout avoiding your cousin’s glance at you. You can tell he’s curious. “My father seemed desperate to marry Rhaenyra after the death of my mother. I’m at my disposal for him to throw away. Why should he make the decisions when I can already be wasting away and producing children?”  Ah there it is. You’re upset more angry at your father. More importantly hurt by the actions of taking a wife so early after the passing of his previous one. Strangely it makes his heart beat faster when you explain you should’ve married by now. Young girls would rather find their prince charming or deny all suitors for their rebellious nature. However you seem to want a husband for a stable life and ultimately avoid your father altogether.   “You will find your husband soon enough” Aemond quivers with a short smile before avoiding your gaze. Suddenly it’s as if you were seeing him for the first time again. His hair was smooth and long behind his shoulders. Without a hair out of place and his face aligned and sharp. With the eye patch over his injured eye that somehow makes him more handsome.   “How do you know?” You challenged him disrupting your walk and looking straight at him. Your eyes stern and alluring attract him drawing him into your trance. Your features could not help but make him seek out more of you.   “I simply know” The one-eyed prince whispers merely inches away from your face. His breath is hot against your presence as he knows you enjoy the mystery the unknown of his words.  The world came crashing down for you when news of your grandmother arrived. You could not slip out a cry or tear. Rhaenyra and like many other of the councilmen were stunned at their loss. Star-stricken with anger and rage a bumbling flame emerged from your chest. And when your stepmother went to nudge you for comfort you merely passed by her without a care. Your shoulders bumped against each other as you rushed out of the Black Council in tears and a deeper desire.   You made your way to the dragon pits. Your dragon Sheepstealer chirps at your approach as the rest of the servants scatter for your departure. It would be a quick departure. Even as you heard the shouts and yells of Rhaenyra and the nobles for you to come back you did not care. The Greens whoever defeated your grandmother was going to die. Even now as you pat the jugular throat of your dragon Sheepstealer knows what you plan to do. Your bond allows him to know to do so.   An exclamation of your name echoes a few feet behind. Jacaerys runs towards you before Sheepstealer the mud-brown beast hums territorially at his proximity. You can’t do this!  “But I can” A quiet sniffle escapes your throat when you climb onto Sheepstealer’s back and saddle. There was possibly no stopping you from what you were about to do. Not even the Queen’s command could make you. The prince lets out an agitated sigh looking down. Before his brown eyes meet your dragon pleading for you to stay. “Rise Sheepstealer.”  You were so much like him it makes Jacaerys terrified of what you plan to do.   To Harrenhal.,2024-07-13 09:13:36 GMT

Algunos dragonkeepers mantienen la creencia que es este deseo de la madre lo que se trasmite a través del vínculo hacia el dragón manteniéndolo anidando durante los meses de gestación humana para que los niños que nazcan acaben teniendo un huevo con el que compartir la cuna otros creen que es a la inversa y es el calor del dragón lo que se siembra en la jinete desde el deseo primitivo de la reproducción; aunque nadie tiene alguna forma de comprobar ninguna teoría el conocimiento de los dragones era demasiado limitado en los días que corrían y si alguna vez esto había tenido respuestas encontraron su fin junto con la herencia de la antigua Valyria.  Siendo Dragonstone la cede del heredero el primer lugar al que llegaron los Targaryen por primera vez desde que dejaron su tierra destinada a la ruina la fertilidad de la princesa Rhaenyra que desembocó en la mayor cantidad de dragones en los cielos y el mayor número de huevos en las cuevas de la isla esas creencias se fortalecieron mediante murmullos de algunos maestres y dragonkeepers interesados en comprender más de la magia valyria. Murmullos que son demasiado débiles como para ir a algún lugar más allá de Dragonstone debido al desinterés y la comprensión escasa de los andalos…una pena realmente porque ahora a kilómetros de allí en Winterfell Cregan no tiene idea de por qué lo asaltaste en medio de la tarde en la sala vacía del consejo por tercera vez en la semana comenzando a montarlo de forma desesperada con tus uñas clavadas sobre sus hombros y tus tetas apretadas contra su rostro mientras continúas suplicando entre gemidos airosos lo mucho que deseas tener su semilla llenándote hasta que desborde tu coño y la sientas chorreando por tus muslos pero créeme no se esta quejando mientras sostiene tus caderas embistiendo desde abajo al compás de tus caderas.,2024-07-13 09:54:22 GMT

Princess Vaelyssa climbed down from his back; her long silver hair plastered to her face by the rain. She ran a hand down Vermithor’s scaled body feeling the warmth radiate through her fingers. The dragon let out a low contented rumble as he nuzzled against her.  Suddenly a louder more ominous growl echoed through the courtyard. Vaelyssa’s heart skipped a beat as she turned to see the massive form of Vhagar looming over the wall.  If she was here then that meant Aemond was here as well. The hostility that been brewing between their family over the years had finally erupted now the Greens had usurped the Iron Throne and had crowned Aegon as King of the seven kingdoms defying her mother Rhaenyra’s rightful claim as set forth by the recently deceased King Viserys.  Vaelyssa took a deep breath steeling herself for what was to come. The knights of Storm’s End approached their armour clinking softly as they moved.  “I am Princess Vaelyssa Velaryon and I have a message for Lord Borros Baratheon on behalf of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen”.  The knight gazed at Vaelyssa; his expression unreadable as he turned and gestured for her to follow.  “Come-“ he said his voice carrying over the rain. &quot;Lord Borros Baratheon waits in the Great Hall.”  She nodded casting one last glance at Vermithor before following the knights. The courtyard was a blur of grey stone and wet banners as they made their way inside the heavy wooden doors closing behind them with a resounding thud.  Inside the Great Hall was dimly lit the flickering torches casting long shadows on the walls. Lord Borros sat on his makeshift stone throne his round imposing figure radiating authority. His eyes were sharp as they took in the sight of the drenched princess.  “Princess Vaelyssa of house Velaryon”  As Vaelyssa stood silent her gaze shifted to Aemond who stood off to the side with one of Borros Baratheon’s daughters. He stood tall and confident; his hands clasped behind his back in a posture of ease that belied the underlying threat he posed.  The daughter a striking young woman with dark hair and piercing eyes seemed captivated by his presence her attention focused solely on him.  Aemond’s expression was inscrutable but Vaelyssa could sense the smug satisfaction radiating from him. His presence here was a calculated move a silent assertion of the Greens’ unwillingness to wait for an answer to the terms that Otto Hightower had delivered to her mother on Dragonstone. His singular amethyst eye caught the torchlight glinting with a mix of amusement and menace.  Vaelyssa’s eyes narrowed as she observed him. It had only been a number of days since she had last seen him strutting out of the dining room after his final tribute to her younger brothers had resulted in a fist fight.  Before that she’d not seen him since that fateful night on Driftmark where he had lost an eye but gained a dragon.  Never would she forget the painful grimace on his face as the Maester’s stitched his skin back together nor would she forget the crazed look on his mother Alicent’s face as she demanded one of Luke’s eyes in return.  “There is a debt to be paid”.  The King had demanded that they make their apologies and show good will to one another but no such apology came sides were taken and the chasm between their family widened even further.  But here now she could not afford to show any sign of weakness or hesitation.  Her mother’s claim to the throne depended on her ability to secure Lord Borros’s support and she could not let Aemond’s presence intimidate her.  “Lord Borros-I brought you a message from my mother-The Queen”.  “Yet earlier today I received an envoy from the King-which is it. King or Queen. The House of the dragon doesn’t seem to know who rules it” laughed Borros.  Vaelyssa glanced over at Aemond who cocked his head to the side and smirked.  “What’s your mother’s message?” asked Borros impatiently.  Vaelyssa handed a rolled up scroll to one of the escorting knights who rushed forward and handed it to Borros who couldn’t read a single word that was written and had to summon a Maester.  Whilst the Maester relayed Rhaenyra’s message Aemond stared at Vaelyssa his hands still folded behind his back.  Not one to be cowed she glared back. They had been friends when they were children but gone was the sweet boy who stole honey cakes for her and in his place stood a man leather clad and lithe his features sharp almost as if he had been carved by the gods of old Valyria themselves. He truly was beautiful just a shame he was such a loathsome cunt.  “Remind me of my father’s oath. King Aegon at least came with an offer: my swords and banners for a marriage pact. If I do as your mother bids-which one of my daughters will your brother’s wed?”  “My lord-I’m afraid that only two of my brothers are of age and neither are free to marry they are already betrothed” replied Vaelyssa.  “-And what of you Princess?” asked Borros stroking his chin.  The rain outside Storm’s End intensified turning from a steady downpour into a relentless deluge. Thunder rumbled ominously in the distance and lightning occasionally lit up the dark sky.  “Me? My Lord” questioned Vaelyssa.  “I have no longer have a wife-and you are of age to marry” said Borros “You are young and if you are anything like your mother I am sure you will give me many sons”.  “My Lord I-“  “My late wife blessed me only with daughters-I am left without a male heir” replied Borros.  “Under my mother’s rule-the eldest would inherit lands and titles regardless of their gender” said Vaelyssa.  “But that is not my desire Princess-“ quipped Borros as he leaned forward slightly.  “Apologise my lord but I am not free to marry either-” replied Vaelyssa her gaze momentarily fixed on Aemond who’s eye widened slightly at her announcement.  “Is that so?” asked Borros leaning forward slightly.  “My brother travels North to offer my hand in marriage to Lord Cregan Stark of Winterfell”.  Again Vaelyssa looked towards Aemond who’s hand was now resting around the pommel of his sword his jaw clenched tight.  His chosen Baratheon girl was trying to speak to him but he paid her no attention.  “Then you come with empty hands-you will tell your mother that the Lord of Storms End is not some dog she can whistle up at need to set against her foes”.  “I will take your answer to the Queen” replied Vaelyssa as she bowed her head politely.  As she turned to go the wind howled outside and the heavy wooden doors of the hall rattled in their frames. The storm was worsening by the minute.  “Wait Princess-” Lord Borros called out his voice carrying over the sound of the storm. She paused and turned back to face him; her curiosity piqued.  “In good conscience I cannot allow you to risk traveling back to Dragonstone in this storm” Lord Borros continued his tone unexpectedly gentle. “The weather is too treacherous. I offer you a room for the night. You may leave in the morning once the storm has passed”.  Vaelyssa hesitated for a moment then inclined her head in gratitude. &quot;Thank you my Lord. I accept your generous offer.”  Lord Borros nodded and then his gaze shifted to Aemond who had been silently observing the exchange with a faint unreadable smile. “Prince Aemond” Borros said “I extend the same courtesy to you. It would be unwise to travel in such conditions.”  Aemond’s smile widened slightly and he inclined his head in acknowledgment. “Your hospitality is appreciated Lord Borros. I too will stay until the storm passes.”  Vaelyssa’s eyes met Aemond’s for a brief tense moment before she turned away following the servants who had been summoned to show her to her room. The castle corridors were dimly lit the flickering torches casting long shadows on the stone walls.  The sound of the storm outside seemed to grow louder the wind howling and the rain lashing against the windows.  She was led to a modest but comfortable chamber the bed adorned with thick furs and a fire crackling in the hearth. The warmth of the room was a stark contrast to the chill of the storm outside and Vaelyssa felt a sense of weariness wash over her. She thanked the servants and closed the door behind her allowing herself a moment of solitude.  As she sat by the fire her thoughts turned to the events of the day. The refusal of Lord Borros was a setback but she could not dwell on it now Storms End might be a lost cause but mayhaps her brothers would have better luck.  Cregan Stark was said to be an honourable man and if he allied with her mother then the rest of the North would follow and Lady Jeyne Arryn was their kin it was doubtful she would turn against them.  Vaelyssa stood by the window gazing out into the stormy night. The rain pounded against the glass and the wind howled like a restless beast. The food the maids had recently brought was only partially eaten and the wine was bitter on her tongue.  Almost as if he sensed her unease Vermithor’s deafening roar pierced through the storm. His massive bronze-scaled form was a reassuring presence in the midst of her lingering uncertainty.  Almost immediately Vhagar answered with an equally impressive roar her call reverberating through the walls of Storm’s End.  Vaelyssa let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding seeing Aemond here had unsettled her and she couldn’t stop thinking of the look he had on his face when she announced that she was not free to marry it was the same look he’d given her when she stood next to Jacaerys in the throne room for the petition for Driftmark and again when she sat next to him at the feast.  Never had a man looked at her in that way before.  She began to undress her mind preoccupied with the events of the day and the challenges that lay ahead.  As she removed her outer garments the door to her chamber suddenly opened. Startled she turned to see Aemond standing there dressed in only a cotton shirt and leather trousers his tall figure framed by the flickering light of the torches in the hallway. He stepped quickly inside and shut the door making sure to lock it behind him.  “What do you want Aemond?” Vaelyssa demanded her voice steady but edged with irritation. “Leave or I will make you.”  Aemond’s lips curled into a smirk his single amethyst eye glinting with amusement. “The fight would be little challenge” he said his tone mocking.  “You clearly don’t know me very well” replied Vaelyssa he face growing hot as she noticed Aemond’s gaze sweeping over her pausing at her breasts which were no doubt visible through the thin material of her shift.  Aemond closed the distance between them a determined glint in his eye. “There is a debt to pay” he said his voice low as he reached up and removed his eyepatch revealing the sapphire embedded in the socket where his left eye had once been.  Clearly her uncle was trying to intimidate her but she would not fall for his provocations.  Vaelyssa scoffed crossing her arms over her chest. “Is that supposed to frighten me? Because I can tell you now that it doesn’t and neither does it impress me qȳbor” (Uncle).  Aemond’s jaw tightened his anger barely contained. “What if I demanded your eye in payment for the one I lost?” he asked.  Vaelyssa met his gaze unflinchingly her expression defiant. “Not my debt to pay and I thought your claim of Vhagar was worth the loss of an eye” she retorted. “Or is your hoary old bitch of a dragon no longer worth it?”  The insult hit its mark and Aemond’s face twisted with fury. His fists clenched at his sides.  “You dare speak of Vhagar that way?” he hissed his voice trembling with rage. “You know nothing of what it means to ride her to command the largest dragon in the world.”  “Tell me Aemond” she began her tone mocking “Do you truly believe the almighty Vhagar could withstand a combined attack from Vermithor Caraxes and Meleys? She might be the largest dragon in the world but even she is not invincible.”  Aemond simply stared at her his expression unreadable as he processed her words.  “You always seem so eager to remind everyone how large Vhagar is” said Vaelyssa a sly smile playing on her lips. “One might wonder if you’re trying to overcompensate for other-smaller matters.”  Aemond’s face twisted in anger once again “You think you’re so clever” he snarled his voice dripping with venom. “But your sharp tongue won’t save you from the reality of this war-your mother is not fit to rule.”  Vaelyssa’s eyes blazed with defiance as she met his gaze. &quot;And what about your precious Greens?” she shot back. “You cling to the throne like parasites. Your brother is nothing but a puppet and you Aemond are his most pathetic string.”  “You dare-“  “Tell me does it sting knowing that your older wastrel of a brother is given everything while you the dutiful son gets nothing?”  Aemond’s eye narrowed his lips pressed into a thin line. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”  “Oh but I do” Vaelyssa purred as she reached out and ran a finger down Aemond’s chest. “Tell me do you not envision yourself sitting upon the Iron Throne? Don’t you think yourself worthy to be King? Or are you content with always living in Aegon’s shadow?”  Aemond’s fists clenched his knuckles turning white. “You think you can provoke me with your petty words?”  “Petty?” Vaelyssa laughed a sharp mocking sound. “-I’m merely pointing out the obvious. You serve you obey you sacrifice and for what? To watch your drunken whoring wastrel of a brother wear the crown that you believe should have been yours?”  Aemond took a step forward his face contorted with anger. “Aegon is the King. That is the order of things.”  “The order of things?” Vaelyssa scoffed. “And you so loyal and dutiful never once imagined it differently? Never once thought that you could do better be better?”  Aemond’s eye blazed with fury and he took another menacing step toward her. “You presume too much”.  “Do I?” she challenged her voice cold and piercing. “Or is it that I’ve struck a nerve? You can lie to yourself Aemond but deep down you know the truth. You want the throne you crave it it is my mother’s by right she is the named heir”.  “Viserys changed his mind”.  “According to who?” snapped Vaelyssa her voice sharp and incredulous.  “My mother was tending to him in his final moments and he declared in her presence that he wished for Aegon to be King” said Aemond his tone defensive but resolute.  Vaelyssa’s eyes blazed with fury. “And my grandsire who that very same day dragged himself out of his sickbed to defend his daughter in front of the realm—only to change his mind hours later? Do me a favour” she retorted her voice dripping with scepticism.  “Are you calling my mother a liar?” Aemond’s singular eye narrowed his jaw tightening.  “My grandsire steadfastly upheld my mother’s status as his heir for over twenty years. He wouldn’t change his mind not like that” Vaelyssa said her voice firm with conviction.  Aemond’s face darkened with a mixture of anger and frustration. “You think I would lie about something like this?”  “You’ll believe what you want to in order to justify your actions-this entire situation reeks of Otto Hightowers manipulations after the death of my grandmother he shoved his own daughter under a grieving Kings nose and used her to further his own ambitions”.  “That’s not-“ muttered Aemond.  “-What happened? Of course it is. Even down his clever manipulation of Viserys. He played on my grandsire’s fears over my father and advocated for my mother to be named heir because he knew damn well that it would be easier to usurp a woman-”  “Daemon was too much of a risk-” said Aemond.  “The only risk was my father seeing Otto Hightower for what he really is-” snarled Vaelyssa.  “Loyal and unwavering-“  “A CUNT!” snarled Vaelyssa.  “Your language is unbecoming of a Princess-“  “I don’t give a flying fuck-your grandsire is nothing but an oath breaking cunt who seeks to reach far beyond his station and it’s not a question of if my mother takes back the Iron Throne it’s when and I can tell you that when she does your grandsire will find himself a head shorter and so will the other treasonous dogs who plotted against her”.  Aemond observed her for a moment a strange expression on his face before he seized her by the back of her neck pulling her close. His lips crashed into hers with a fierce almost brutal intensity. The kiss was rough a clash of wills a battle for dominance.  At first Vaelyssa was stunned her body rigid with surprise. But as the heat of the moment consumed her she found herself responding pulling him closer.  The initial shock melted away replaced by a fiery passion that surged through her veins. She returned the kiss with equal fervour their lips moving together in a furious dance.  Aemond’s grip on her neck tightened his other hand snaking around her waist to press her against him. Vaelyssa’s hands found their way to his chest her fingers curling into the fabric of his shirt as she pulled him even closer.  When they finally broke apart both were breathing heavily their faces flushed. Aemond’s eye burned with a mix of anger and desire and Vaelyssa’s own gaze mirrored that intensity.  “Is this what you wanted?” Aemond growled his voice low and rough. “To provoke me?”  Vaelyssa’s lips curled into a defiant smirk her breath still coming in ragged gasps. “Perhaps. Or maybe I just wanted to see if you truly were a dragon and not a slithering green Hightower snake.”  Aemond’s grip on her neck loosened slightly but he didn’t let go. “You’ve seen my fire” he murmured his voice softer but no less intense. “Now what will you do with it?”  In response Vaelyssa leaned in and kissed him again this time slower more deliberate. The passion between them didn’t wane; if anything it grew hotter more intense. The kiss was no longer a battle but a mutual surrender to the heat that had been building between them.  As they broke apart once more their foreheads resting against each other the reality of their situation began to seep back in. They were on opposite sides of a war bound by duty and loyalty to their respective causes. But in this moment none of that mattered. All that existed was the fire they had ignited between them.  “We are playing with fire Aemond” Vaelyssa whispered her voice tinged with a mixture of exhilaration and trepidation.  “Let it burn” Aemond replied his tone equally resolute. “Let it consume us both.”  Vaelyssa had lost most of her senses the moment Aemond had pressed her onto the bed and knelt down between her open legs.  “My niece-my sweetest-” whispered Aemond.  Vaelyssa’s eyes rolled into the back of her head as Aemond’s tongue swept across her slick wet folds.  She bit the back of her hand to keep herself from screaming as Aemond began using his long fingers to slowly tease her entrance.  “None of that. I want to hear how good I make you feel” growled Aemond as he began moving his tongue against her in rhythm with his fingers.  “A-Aemond. Oh god. Please” moaned Vaelyssa as she writhed against the sheets.  “I know your almost there. Let it happen. Come for me” whispered Aemond his tongue moving across her pearl.  Vaelyssa arched her back and let out a scream as her pleasure erupted.  Aemond slowly crawled up her body placing gentle kisses on her skin as he moved higher and higher.  Vaelyssa blushed furiously when she saw that Aemond’s chin was shining with her slick.  “Calm yourself issa zaldrīzes” muttered Aemond as he swiped his fingers over his chin and then placed them in his mouth sucking off her slick. (My dragon).  Goosebumps erupted over Vaelyssa’s skin as Aemond removed his hand from his mouth and then took hold of her breast his fingers teasing her rosy bud.  “A-Aemond” whimpered Vaelyssa.  “Sīr gevie” growled Aemond (So Beautiful).  “W-What are you doing?” asked Vaelyssa as Aemond’s hand slid down her body and began teasing her folds.  “I-I need to prepare you a little more” whispered Aemond.  “P-prepare me?” whispered Vaelyssa.  “I assume you are a maiden-I don’t want to hurt you” replied Aemond.  “Aemond” exclaimed Vaelyssa as he slowly slipped a finger inside her the slick from her first peak easing the way.  Aemond buried his face in Vaelyssa’s neck as he began peppering kisses along her smooth skin as he added another finger moving them in and out slowly.  “So warm-so wet for me” rasped Aemond his hot breath tickling her skin.  “I-I think I’m ready” whispered Vaelyssa.  Aemond removed his fingers and then moved between her open legs supporting his weight on his left arm as he reached down and took his hard cock in his hand and placed the tip of it against her slick entrance.  “A-Are you sure?”  “Yes-I want you Aemond-all of you” replied Vaelyssa as she felt him running his cock along her entrance.  “Y-You must tell me if it hurts” whispered Aemond.  Vaelyssa nodded and shut her eyes tight taking a deep breath as Aemond sheathed himself within her.  “Your doing so well-” muttered Aemond trying to control himself.  “I-It h-hurts-“ whimpered Vaelyssa the burning sensation bringing tears to her eyes.  “If it’s too much I can pull out-” offered Aemond.  “N-No just give me a moment” replied Vaelyssa softly as the tears ran down her cheeks.  Aemond leaned down and pressed gentle kisses to her cheeks his tongue catching her fallen tears.  Aemond’s cock twitched and throbbed with need and he released a shuddered breath while Vaelyssa sighed in relief.   “Are you ok?” asked Aemond.  “I-I think you can move now” whispered Vaelyssa her hands running along the smooth plans of Aemond’s back.  Slowly Aemond withdrew and then moved forward his cock reaching deep inside her.  “Are you ok?” repeated Aemond as he thrust inside her.  “Y-yes-I think you can move faster”.  Aemond rested his head in the crook of her neck as he thrusts faster his moans muffled against her skin.  “Ooh Aemond-that feels good” whined Vaelyssa.  “Your perfect-” whispered Aemond.  Feeling a spark of pleasure Vaelyssa dug her fingers into Aemonds back holding him close.  “P-please Aemond. F-faster. H-harder” exclaimed Vaelyssa.  “Lyssa-” moaned Aemond as he began to pound into her his hips slapping against hers.  “-I-I f-feel-” whimpered Vaelyssa an odd sensation creeping across her stomach.  “-Let it happen-my sweetest peak for me” exclaimed Aemond.  “OH-”  “Fuck-that’s it-that’s it” muttered Aemond as he slipped his hand between their bodies and slowly began rubbing her pearl.  “AEMOND” screamed Vaelyssa as her peak exploded making her entire body shake.  “I-I’m going to give you my seed-see you all round and swollen with my child-your breasts filled with milk” moaned Aemond.  “Yes-yes. Aemond. I want it-” babbled Vaelyssa as his thrusts became more frantic.  “Fuck-” groaned Aemond as he felt the heat shooting across his abdomen.  “-Aemond” whimpered Vaelyssa.  “ñuhon ry ñuhon” moaned Aemond pushed into the hilt for one last time his cock throbbing as he spilled rope after rope of his seed (Mine all mine).  “Ry aōhon” whispered Vaelyssa as Aemond rested on top of her (All yours).  “A-Are you ok?” Aemond as he gently pulled his softened cock from Vaelyssa he looked down and saw the mixture of his seed and her maidens blood dripping onto the sheet.  Vaelyssa nodded slowly as she allowed him to enfold her in his arms and hold her close.  “What happens now?” asked Vaelyssa softly her voice tinged with uncertainty. “Are we just to go back to being enemies in the morning?”  Aemond hesitated for a moment his fingers tracing absent patterns on her bare shoulder. “No” he replied finally his voice low and steady. “I will accompany you to Dragonstone and declare for Rhaenyra.”  Vaelyssa’s eyes widened in surprise her heart skipping a beat. “You-you would declare for my mother?” she asked incredulous.  Aemond nodded his expression serious. “Yes” he affirmed. “For you.”  Vaelyssa searched his face trying to comprehend his sudden change of allegiance. “Why Aemond?” she pressed gently. “Why would you do that?”  “Nyke jaelagon naejot dīnagon ao” replied Aemond (I wish to marry you).  “My father will have his sword at your neck the moment you leave Vhagar’s side”.  “That maybe so but surely your mother will see the benefits of our union without Vhagar Kings Landing is vulnerable and my brother’s position as King will be weakened no doubt your father’s bloodlust will be sated by rooting out the traitors who conspired against his Queen-” said Aemond.  “-If you declare for her then she is to be your Queen as well” muttered Vaelyssa.  “Only if she accepts my request for your hand in marriage“ admitted Aemond his voice tinged with a hint of vulnerability. ”-And by our marriage one day I will be King.“  Vaelyssa blinked processing his words. &quot;Is that what this is? You desire the throne and your using me to get it” she asked quietly her mind racing with the implications of his confession and admittedly the thought of him using her did sting.  “Do you remember when we were children when everyone else had their dragons and we only had each other”  “Yes” muttered Vaelyssa softly.  “-How I used to steal honey cakes for you and then we’d sit under the weirwood tree dreaming of our future-”  “What does that have to do with anything?” asked Vaelyssa.  “My vision for the future was of us-together. We have always been fated bound by more than blood. You label me Hightower but I am a dragon and I have found my treasure. We belong together you and I” muttered Aemond.  “-And the throne?” asked Vaelyssa.  Aemond sighed brushing a strand of hair away from her face. ”-I do want to be King but only with you by my side as my Queen&quot;.  “Your ambitious I’ll give you that-but why not just displace Aegon?” mused Vaelyssa.  “When you steal something you spend your whole life fighting to keep it. I want a legitimate route to the throne through the bonds of marriage”.  “What about your betrothal to one of Borros Baratheon’s daughters?” she asked softly her fingers tracing patterns on Aemond’s chest. “He might see it as an insult that you promised to wed one of his daughters yet you plan to take another to wife.”  Aemond scoffed a smirk playing on his lips. “A boar is nothing compared to a dragon” he said dismissively. “Lord Borros can be placated. If your mother accepts my terms she can make the necessary arrangements for a marriage between Floris and some lord of note.”  Vaelyssa couldn’t help but smile at his confidence but she knew the complexities of politics couldn’t be brushed aside so easily. “And you believe Lord Borros will simply accept this?”  Aemond’s expression turned serious. “He is ambitious but he is also pragmatic. An alliance with House Targaryen especially one that strengthens Rhaenyra’s claim would be more valuable than a slighted promise. Besides Rhaenyra can offer him a position on the council and favourable marriages for his other daughters. He will not refuse such a boon”.  Vaelyssa nodded slowly considering his words. “You have given this a great deal of thought” she admitted. “But there may be other who whisper of false promises”.  “Let them” Aemond replied with a shrug. “The realm is on the brink of war. Loyalties will shift alliances will be made and broken. In the end what matters is who sits on the Iron Throne”.  “One might think you’ve been planning this for years.”  Aemond’s gaze was intense as he held hers. “I have” he admitted his voice low and fervent. “You are all I’ve wanted since I was old enough to know the ache of wants and desires. My grandsire usurping the throne convinced me that my dream would no longer be achievable and that placing the wants and needs of others above my own desires was something I would just have to accept.”  He paused his fingers tracing the contours of her face. “But your arrival at Storm’s End was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. I am a determined man Vaelyssa and I learned long ago that nothing was ever going to be handed to me. If I wanted something then I would have to take it.”  Vaelyssa’s breath caught in her throat at his confession. “You would risk everything for this?” she asked her voice barely above a whisper. “For us?”  Aemond nodded his expression resolute. “Yes. I would. Because for the first time I see a path to the life I’ve always wanted. A life where I am not just the second son where I am not bound by the whims of others. A life with you-providing of course that your mother accepts all of my terms-”  “What exactly are all of your terms Aemond?” asked Vaelyssa curiously.  Aemond met her eyes his expression resolute. “If Rhaenyra wants me to bend the knee to her then she will allow us to marry” he stated firmly. “Our union will strengthen her claim and bring House Targaryen closer together just as my dearly departed father always wanted-”  Vaelyssa nodded slowly “And what else?” she prompted.  Aemond’s features softened slightly a hint of vulnerability showing through his stern facade. “I want assurances that my family will be safe” he said his voice quiet but determined. “-My mother Aegon Helaena their children and Daeron—no harm will come to them. They must be allowed to live in peace.”  “You will not advocate for your grandsire?” asked Vaelyssa.  “No-”  “Just as well as my father wouldn’t allow him to live not after what he’s done” replied Vaelyssa.  “Your father isn’t my only concern your mother-” said Aemond.  “-My mother is not the monster you believe her to be” she began her voice gentle yet firm. “Only those who actively repudiated the succession and conspired against her will be dealt with.”  Aemond scoffed a hint of bitterness in his tone. “Did she not demand that I be sharply questioned as a child?” he retorted his voice growing colder. “To learn where I heard such slanders against her children—slanders which by the way are true.”  Vaelyssa’s expression softened a mix of sadness and determination in her eyes. “It doesn’t matter” she said quietly but firmly. “Laenor claimed us as his children so therefore in the eyes of gods and men we are his. He loved us as his cared for us as his.”  Aemond shook his head his frustration evident. “The truth is plain to see when it comes to your brothers at least Rhaenyra’s claim to the throne is weakened by those lies.”  Vaelyssa took a deep breath her hand reaching out to touch his arm. “The truth of our parentage does not change the fact that we are my mother’s children and Laenor’s by law. We have the right to be acknowledged and accepted. We cannot let old grudges and suspicions destroy what we are trying to build.”  Aemond’s eye softened slightly though his jaw remained tense. “You ask much of me Vaelyssa. To overlook what I know to be true to forgive and forget what happened”.  Vaelyssa took a deep breath looking into Aemond’s eye with a mixture of sorrow and determination. “I am not asking you to forgive Luke for what he took from you” she began softly. “But I am asking for an understanding that all were in the wrong that night. Your claiming of Vhagar was ill-timed at the funeral of her previous rider no less. You could have waited—but I understand. I know that feeling of not being enough of having an egg that doesn’t hatch-you weren’t the only one to be mocked for not having a dragon-”  Aemond’s expression hardened slightly but he listened intently his jaw tense.  ”-Vhagar chose you for a reason just as my bronze fury chose me&quot; Vaelyssa continued her voice steady. “Your claim of her should have been celebrated not marred by conflict. The fight shouldn’t have happened. You shouldn’t have tried to bash Jace’s head in with a rock and Luke shouldn’t have taken your eye. But he was scared and only wanted to defend his brother.”  Aemond looked away a mix of emotions playing across his face—anger pain regret. “That night changed everything” he murmured his voice barely audible.  Vaelyssa nodded her hand reaching out to gently touch his. “It did” she agreed. “And we cannot change what happened. But we can choose how we move forward. We can choose to understand each other’s pain to acknowledge the mistakes that were made.”  Aemond turned back to her his eye searching hers for sincerity. “And what then?” he asked his voice tinged with bitterness. “Do we simply forget? Pretend it never happened?”  “No” Vaelyssa said firmly. “We remember but we also strive to be better. To not let the past dictate our future. We use our pain our experiences to guide us in making wiser decisions in fostering a realm where our future children won’t have to face the same heartaches.”  Aemond’s gaze softened slightly a hint of vulnerability breaking through his hardened exterior. “It’s not easy” he admitted his voice thick with emotion. “To let go of the anger the need for vengeance.”  “I know” Vaelyssa whispered squeezing his hand. “But we have to try. For us for our future and for the realm. We can’t let the mistakes of our past define who we are now or who we can become look at what it’s done to those who came before us-We must be the ones to break the cycle or it will just keep happening until there is nothing left of House Targaryen”  Aemond’s expression shifted as he absorbed Vaelyssa’s words. A flicker of amusement danced in his eye and he leaned closer a teasing smirk curling his lips. “Our future children you say?” he remarked his tone playful.  Vaelyssa blinked momentarily taken aback. “I’m trying to be sensible here and that’s what you focus on?” she retorted a hint of exasperation in her voice.  Aemond’s smirk widened a glint of mischief in his eye. “I quite like the idea of seeing you swelling with my seed” he murmured his voice dropping to a low intimate whisper. “Being all full of me. I think we should do all we can to ensure my seed takes”.  Vaelyssa’s cheeks flushed with a mix of embarrassment and arousal a shiver running down her spine at his words.  She opened her mouth to reply but found herself momentarily speechless as she felt Aemond’s hard cock pressed against her hip.  “Pār gūrogon issa tepagon issa aōha nūmo se nyke shall tepagon ao nykeā tresy””muttered Vaelyssa as she coiled her hands in Aemond’s long silver hair (Then take me give me your seed and I shall give you a son).  “Nyke jāhor emagon ao naenie jēdi bisa bantis” growled Aemond as he rolled on top of her (I will have you many times this night).  “Hae naenie jēdi hae ao jaelagon issa dārys” (As many times as you wish my King).  The morning sun broke through the clouds casting a golden glow over Storm’s End. The storm had cleared leaving the air crisp and fresh.  Vaelyssa stood beside Vermithor her hands resting on his warm rough scales her cheek pressed against him. ”Jēda naejot jikagon lenton issa dōna“ she murmured softly (Time to go home my sweet).  Vermithor trilled happily a low rumbling sound that reverberated through her bones.  She took a deep breath savouring the moment of calm before the journey ahead. As she glanced over she saw Aemond climbing the rope ladder attached to Vhagar’s saddle his movements confident and swift.  He caught her eye and gave a slight nod a hint of a smile playing on his lips. Vaelyssa couldn’t help but smile back feeling the dull throbbing sensation between her legs—a reminder of the night they had shared.  Aemond had made good on his promise his appetite for her had been ravenous he kissed sucked licked and fucked her well into the hours of the night. Never fully satisfied until he’d filled her with his seed another three times.  Even just this morning he had reached for her again; he had refused to let her bathe afterwards and had worked himself into such a frenzy at the thought of her returning to Dragonstone with his seed dripping from her that he bent her over the small desk and fucked her hard and fast. His fingers digging into her hips as he lost himself to the pleasure he sought his loud moans echoing around the room as he spilled himself inside her.  She placed a hand on her stomach and wondered if his seed had already taken root. She’d had her moonblood a fortnight ago and she would not take moontea so there was a chance.  Her thoughts then turned to her mother. She had been sent to secure Borros Baratheon’s support but she was returning to Dragonstone with a far greater alliance.  Vaelyssa wondered how her mother would react to the news. Would she see the wisdom in their union the strength it would bring to her cause? Or would she be wary of the potential complications?  Vaelyssa knew one thing for certain: she had to convince her mother of the value of this alliance. She stroked Vermithor’s scales one last time before stepping back ready to mount.  Aemond was now settled atop Vhagar his gaze steady and unwavering as he watched her. Vaelyssa climbed onto Vermithor’s back her movements graceful and practiced. She looked over at Aemond one more time a mixture of resolve and tenderness in her eyes.  &quot;Ready?” Aemond called out his voice carrying over the morning breeze.  Vaelyssa finished securing the straps of her saddle and nodded her heart pounding with anticipation. “Ready.”  With a synchronized roar Vermithor and Vhagar spread their massive wings the powerful beats stirring up the air around them. They took to the sky the ground falling away beneath them as they soared higher and higher.  As they flew side by side Vaelyssa felt a sense of exhilaration and determination. She was not just returning to Dragonstone with a message; she was bringing back a promise of unity a chance for a brighter future.  The wind rushed past her and she closed her eyes for a moment envisioning the world they could build together—a world where their children would grow up in peace and prosperity.  Opening her eyes she looked over at Aemond once more their paths now intertwined by fate and choice. Together they would face the challenges ahead and together they would shape the destiny of their house and their realm.  Vermithor and Vhagar circled Dragonstone in wide arcs their loud roars echoing across the cliffs and the surrounding sea announcing their arrival to all within earshot.  As the two dragons descended their enormous wings created gusts of wind that swept across the grassy cliffs.  They landed with resounding thuds the ground trembling beneath their combined weight. Vaelyssa swiftly unlatched herself from Vermithor’s saddle her movements practiced and fluid. She slid down his side and landed gracefully on the ground her gaze turning to Aemond.  Aemond climbed down the rope ladder attached to Vhagar’s saddle his every movement exuding a calm confidence. When he reached the ground he immediately sought out Vaelyssa his eye locking onto hers. He crossed the short distance between them and took her hand in his squeezing it gently.  The pair stood firm side by side as they awaited the arrival of her mother and father.  It wasn’t very long before the unmistaken shuffle and clang of armour permeated through the air.  Her mother and father were slowly making their way towards them surrounded by the Queens guard.  Daemon’s hand as always rested on the hilt of his sword his gaze was sharp and assessing taking in the sight of Aemond standing beside Vaelyssa.  The golden crown atop Rhaenyra’s head shone brilliantly in the sunlight a symbol of her rightful claim to the throne and the burden of the responsibility she bore.  As Rhaenyra neared her expression one of regal composure mixed with a hint of curiosity and concern as Aemond’s grip on Vaelyssa’s hand tightened.  “Mother” Vaelyssa greeted her voice steady though she felt the flutter of nerves in her chest.  Rhaenyra’s eyes softened as she looked at her daughter but her gaze quickly shifted to Aemond a mixture of suspicion and curiosity evident. “Vaelyssa” she acknowledged.  Daemon stepped forward his gaze flicking between the two. &quot;Why is that Hightower cunt here” he asked his voice carrying an edge of scepticism.  Vaelyssa took a deep breath standing taller. &quot;Please Father let me explain-” she began her voice strong. “As you know I was sent to secure Lord Borros Baratheon’s support-but instead I have returned with an even greater alliance.”  Daemon’s eyes narrowed slightly his gaze locking onto Aemond. “Explain” he commanded his tone leaving no room for evasion.  Aemond let go of Vaelyssa’s hand and stepped forward he unsheathed his sword and dropped to one knee.  “I Aemond of House Targaryen pledge my loyalty and that of Vhagar to you Queen Rhaenyra of House Targaryen the First of Her Name Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men Lady of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm-”  Daemon’s gaze bore into Aemond with a piercing intensity his hand still resting on the hilt of his sword. “And what assurance do we have that this isn’t some ploy?” he demanded his voice edged with scepticism. “How do we know you’re not seeking to gain our trust only to betray us later?”  Aemond met Daemon’s challenging stare his expression resolute &quot;I swear upon my honour” he declared firmly his voice carrying across the tense silence “My intentions are honest. I wish no harm to Queen Rhaenyra or her rule”.  Vaelyssa stepped forward her voice joining Aemond’s in earnest plea. &quot;Father please” she urged her eyes pleading with Daemon. “Aemond has shown his commitment. He risked much to declare his support openly. We must consider the alliance this could bring.”  Daemon’s expression softened slightly as he regarded his daughter then turned back to Aemond. “Words are wind” he stated bluntly his tone challenging. “Actions speak louder. What will you do to prove your loyalty boy?”  Aemond’s jaw clenched briefly before he spoke his voice steady and unwavering. “I will swear any oath undergo any trial to prove my sincerity” he replied his gaze locked with Daemon’s.  Rhaenyra who had been observing the exchange with a measured silence finally spoke. “Daemon let us hear him” she said softly her eyes never leaving Aemond’s face. “Let us hear what he proposes.”  Daemon considered his wife’s words then nodded slowly. “Very well” he agreed his voice gruff. “Speak Aemond. What oath will you swear to prove your loyalty to the rightful Queen?”  Aemond straightened the weight of the moment heavy upon him. He rose to his feet and took a step forward his gaze unwavering as he addressed the Queen and her consort. “I swear by the old gods-” he began solemnly “-that I will serve the rightful Queen with unwavering loyalty and devotion.”  A murmur rippled through the Queen’s Guard and Rhaenyra raised a hand to silence them her eyes never leaving Aemond’s face. “And what do you seek in return?” she asked her voice cool and measured.  Aemond glanced at Vaelyssa drawing strength from her presence. “I ask for your daughter’s hand in marriage” he said clearly. “And assurances that my family—my mother my siblings and their children—will be kept safe and unharmed.”  “And why do you not advocate for your grandsire?” Rhaenyra questioned; her voice measured.  Aemond met her gaze evenly. “Because it would be a pointless endeavour- he actively conspired against you” he replied firmly.  Daemon’s voice cut through the silence that followed. “Who were Otto’s co-conspirators?” he demanded his tone sharp and demanding. “There is no way he acted alone. Speak the truth boy-”  Aemond’s jaw tightened briefly his resolve unwavering. “I will name those I know of” he answered his voice steady. “But I cannot guarantee it is an exhaustive list.”  He took a breath and began each name a weighty admission in the cold air. “Tyland Lannister” he stated plainly his gaze flicking briefly to Vaelyssa &quot;As well as Jasper Wylde Maester Orwyle and Larys Strong-”  “I shall see everyone of those traitorous cunts suffer for this-” snarled Daemon his knuckles turning white as he tightly gripped the hilt of Dark Sister.  Rhaenyra considered Aemond’s words carefully and finally after what felt like an eternity she spoke.  &quot;I agree to your terms brother-” Rhaenyra declared her voice resonating with authority. “I will guarantee the safety of Alicent Aegon Helaena their children and Daeron.”  Aemond’s expression softened slightly a flicker of relief crossing his features. Beside him Vaelyssa’s eyes shone with gratitude and hope.  “But-” Rhaenyra continued her tone firm “-Only when I have reclaimed the Iron Throne will I permit you and Vaelyssa to marry. For now you will be betrothed as a pledge of our alliance.”  Aemond bowed his head respectfully. “Gratitude-Your Grace”  &quot;Now the two of you will be escorted inside-” Rhaenyra announced her voice commanding yet tinged with a touch of warmth. “-Baths will be prepared. You both smell of dragon”  Vaelyssa and Aemond exchanged a glance their expressions reflecting a mixture of relief and anticipation. “Of course Your Grace” Aemond responded respectfully.  “And I expect the both of you at dinner tonight” Rhaenyra added firmly her eyes shifting between them to emphasize her expectations.  “Yes mother-” Vaelyssa affirmed with a nod her voice steady despite the whirlwind of emotions within her.  As they turned to make their way back toward Dragonstone Daemon halted Vaelyssa with a gentle yet firm grasp on her arm.  Aemond hesitated momentarily but Vaelyssa reassured him with a reassuring glance and a soft-spoken promise to join him shortly. He nodded and followed Rhaenyra and the Queen’s Guard towards the castle.  Alone with her father Vaelyssa felt a surge of pride mingled with a touch of vulnerability as Daemon gently took her face in his hands and turned her head to the side to see the various love bites that graced her skin.  &quot;Well done-” muttered Daemon his voice gruff yet tinged with unmistakable approval.  Vaelyssa smiled her heart swelling with gratitude at his words. &quot;I learned from the best”,2024-07-13 12:27:42 GMT

I think her being a dreamer adds this other lovely layer of irony that viserys is so obsessed with the past and with the song of ice and fire that he ignores his daughter with ACTUAL daenys level prophetic abilities. that being said it makes me so sad that we never see her and dreamfyre… I’m not like a massive fan of the dragons themselves like some people are but dreamfyre has always been one of my favourites! she’s gorgeous and she was rhaena’s and I love her. I feel like it makes no sense for helaena to love critters and bugs but then ignore her actual dragon which she’s bonded with. and grrm has actually confirmed that she spends lots of time with dreamfyre so it’s not just like a eustace propaganda thing!!! yeah in summary i don’t really like how they’ve neglected showing bonds with the dragons on the dragon show. same for aegon and sunfyre tbh they’re canonically the closest out of all the dragons and their riders,2024-07-13 12:17:42 GMT

You smiled admiring his pleasant features the warm blue eyes the bow shaped lips soft golden hair.  “Good morrow cousin” Lady Hightower greeted.  “Good morrow my Lady” the knight responded. “Perfect day for a joust is it not?”  “It is” Lady Lynesse concurred. “I wish you luck good cousin at the lists.”  “Thank you my Lady.”  Ser Gwayne bowed stepping aside to let the lady pass.   As you passed him yourself curtseying briefly he put out a hand to stop you.  “A moment Lady Mullendore.”  You followed him inside cloistered in a hidden alcove right by the doors.   “If I might request a favour my lady.” He had that grin on his face that suggested his thoughts were anything but innocent. Not that the way he said ‘my lady’ had you thinking innocent thoughts either as you clenched your thighs together at his words.  “Hmm and what sort of favour would that be good knight” you said smiling sweetly.   “Mayhaps a sweet kiss from those lovely lips dear lady.”  “Oh you are most bold good ser” you giggled feeling your cheeks redden at his words. And that little smirk that he always seemed to have plastered on his face. Seven save you you loved that smirk.  A small group of people squeezed past the opening you were concealed in. So you stretched up and planted a soft kiss on his cheek. Then you turned away to rejoin your lady.  A hand grasped your arm pulling you back into the shadows.  “Gwayne!” you chastised. “I must return to my-”  His hand snaked around your waist tugging you up against his body. A single finger lifted your chin angling your face towards his and he stared hungrily at your lips. He bit his lip moving his hand to grasp your chin running a thumb over your parted lips.  “Not that sort of kiss” he whispered seductively.  Then his lips were on yours. This was no gentle kiss like the ones exchanged so early in the mornings. Sweet it was not. He pulled your face to his pushing his tongue into your mouth. His hand tightened at your waist.   Your hands stretched up tangling themselves in his soft golden hair. Your heart pounded in time to the movements of his tongue. He tasted of the sweet wine he liked probably drinking small amounts to calm his nerves before the joust.   He pushed forwards backing you into a wall completely devouring your mouth. pressing the evidence of his own arousal into your thigh. A moan escaped you. Seven save you this kiss…  He pulled away abruptly swiping his thumb over your lips again before departing with a satisfied smirk on his face.  He vanished so quickly it took a moment for your body and mind to catch up. You raised a hand to your lips remembering the passionate way he claimed them.   Voices sounded just outside and you remembered where you were.,2024-07-13 12:09:07 GMT

At least in the show…  If the twins were born in Pentos and Laena says that Baela’s dragon was born to her well the only female dragon there is Vhagar. Vhagar and Caraxes have to be show!canon Moondancer parents. I mean ig that would make sense as to why only Baela’s egg hatched and Rhaena’s dragon (although it did hatched) was born so frail and sickly before dying; Granny Vhagar too old for this shit💀  In my opinion Vhagar and Moondancer even look somewhat similar and share a similar color pallet:   All just opinions obviously and have nothing to do with the books only the show  I just find it interesting and have lowkey been tryna figure out the dragons family tree bc not gonna lie they need to release that😭😭😭   Okay bye,2024-07-13 12:45:52 GMT

Princess Vaelyssa climbed down from his back; her long silver hair plastered to her face by the rain. She ran a hand down Vermithor’s scaled body feeling the warmth radiate through her fingers. The dragon let out a low contented rumble as he nuzzled against her.  Suddenly a louder more ominous growl echoed through the courtyard. Vaelyssa’s heart skipped a beat as she turned to see the massive form of Vhagar looming over the wall.  If she was here then that meant Aemond was here as well. The hostility that been brewing between their family over the years had finally erupted now the Greens had usurped the Iron Throne and had crowned Aegon as King of the seven kingdoms defying her mother Rhaenyra’s rightful claim as set forth by the recently deceased King Viserys.  Vaelyssa took a deep breath steeling herself for what was to come. The knights of Storm’s End approached their armour clinking softly as they moved.  “I am Princess Vaelyssa Velaryon and I have a message for Lord Borros Baratheon on behalf of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen”.  The knight gazed at Vaelyssa; his expression unreadable as he turned and gestured for her to follow.  “Come-“ he said his voice carrying over the rain. &quot;Lord Borros Baratheon waits in the Great Hall.”  She nodded casting one last glance at Vermithor before following the knights. The courtyard was a blur of grey stone and wet banners as they made their way inside the heavy wooden doors closing behind them with a resounding thud.  Inside the Great Hall was dimly lit the flickering torches casting long shadows on the walls. Lord Borros sat on his makeshift stone throne his round imposing figure radiating authority. His eyes were sharp as they took in the sight of the drenched princess.  “Princess Vaelyssa of house Velaryon”  As Vaelyssa stood silent her gaze shifted to Aemond who stood off to the side with one of Borros Baratheon’s daughters. He stood tall and confident; his hands clasped behind his back in a posture of ease that belied the underlying threat he posed.  The daughter a striking young woman with dark hair and piercing eyes seemed captivated by his presence her attention focused solely on him.  Aemond’s expression was inscrutable but Vaelyssa could sense the smug satisfaction radiating from him. His presence here was a calculated move a silent assertion of the Greens’ unwillingness to wait for an answer to the terms that Otto Hightower had delivered to her mother on Dragonstone. His singular amethyst eye caught the torchlight glinting with a mix of amusement and menace.  Vaelyssa’s eyes narrowed as she observed him. It had only been a number of days since she had last seen him strutting out of the dining room after his final tribute to her younger brothers had resulted in a fist fight.  Before that she’d not seen him since that fateful night on Driftmark where he had lost an eye but gained a dragon.  Never would she forget the painful grimace on his face as the Maester’s stitched his skin back together nor would she forget the crazed look on his mother Alicent’s face as she demanded one of Luke’s eyes in return.  “There is a debt to be paid”.  The King had demanded that they make their apologies and show good will to one another but no such apology came sides were taken and the chasm between their family widened even further.  But here now she could not afford to show any sign of weakness or hesitation.  Her mother’s claim to the throne depended on her ability to secure Lord Borros’s support and she could not let Aemond’s presence intimidate her.  “Lord Borros-I brought you a message from my mother-The Queen”.  “Yet earlier today I received an envoy from the King-which is it. King or Queen. The House of the dragon doesn’t seem to know who rules it” laughed Borros.  Vaelyssa glanced over at Aemond who cocked his head to the side and smirked.  “What’s your mother’s message?” asked Borros impatiently.  Vaelyssa handed a rolled up scroll to one of the escorting knights who rushed forward and handed it to Borros who couldn’t read a single word that was written and had to summon a Maester.  Whilst the Maester relayed Rhaenyra’s message Aemond stared at Vaelyssa his hands still folded behind his back.  Not one to be cowed she glared back. They had been friends when they were children but gone was the sweet boy who stole honey cakes for her and in his place stood a man leather clad and lithe his features sharp almost as if he had been carved by the gods of old Valyria themselves. He truly was beautiful just a shame he was such a loathsome cunt.  “Remind me of my father’s oath. King Aegon at least came with an offer: my swords and banners for a marriage pact. If I do as your mother bids-which one of my daughters will your brother’s wed?”  “My lord-I’m afraid that only two of my brothers are of age and neither are free to marry they are already betrothed” replied Vaelyssa.  “-And what of you Princess?” asked Borros stroking his chin.  The rain outside Storm’s End intensified turning from a steady downpour into a relentless deluge. Thunder rumbled ominously in the distance and lightning occasionally lit up the dark sky.  “Me? My Lord” questioned Vaelyssa.  “I have no longer have a wife-and you are of age to marry” said Borros “You are young and if you are anything like your mother I am sure you will give me many sons”.  “My Lord I-“  “My late wife blessed me only with daughters-I am left without a male heir” replied Borros.  “Under my mother’s rule-the eldest would inherit lands and titles regardless of their gender” said Vaelyssa.  “But that is not my desire Princess-“ quipped Borros as he leaned forward slightly.  “Apologise my lord but I am not free to marry either-” replied Vaelyssa her gaze momentarily fixed on Aemond who’s eye widened slightly at her announcement.  “Is that so?” asked Borros leaning forward slightly.  “My brother travels North to offer my hand in marriage to Lord Cregan Stark of Winterfell”.  Again Vaelyssa looked towards Aemond who’s hand was now resting around the pommel of his sword his jaw clenched tight.  His chosen Baratheon girl was trying to speak to him but he paid her no attention.  “Then you come with empty hands-you will tell your mother that the Lord of Storms End is not some dog she can whistle up at need to set against her foes”.  “I will take your answer to the Queen” replied Vaelyssa as she bowed her head politely.  As she turned to go the wind howled outside and the heavy wooden doors of the hall rattled in their frames. The storm was worsening by the minute.  “Wait Princess-” Lord Borros called out his voice carrying over the sound of the storm. She paused and turned back to face him; her curiosity piqued.  “In good conscience I cannot allow you to risk traveling back to Dragonstone in this storm” Lord Borros continued his tone unexpectedly gentle. “The weather is too treacherous. I offer you a room for the night. You may leave in the morning once the storm has passed”.  Vaelyssa hesitated for a moment then inclined her head in gratitude. &quot;Thank you my Lord. I accept your generous offer.”  Lord Borros nodded and then his gaze shifted to Aemond who had been silently observing the exchange with a faint unreadable smile. “Prince Aemond” Borros said “I extend the same courtesy to you. It would be unwise to travel in such conditions.”  Aemond’s smile widened slightly and he inclined his head in acknowledgment. “Your hospitality is appreciated Lord Borros. I too will stay until the storm passes.”  Vaelyssa’s eyes met Aemond’s for a brief tense moment before she turned away following the servants who had been summoned to show her to her room. The castle corridors were dimly lit the flickering torches casting long shadows on the stone walls.  The sound of the storm outside seemed to grow louder the wind howling and the rain lashing against the windows.  She was led to a modest but comfortable chamber the bed adorned with thick furs and a fire crackling in the hearth. The warmth of the room was a stark contrast to the chill of the storm outside and Vaelyssa felt a sense of weariness wash over her. She thanked the servants and closed the door behind her allowing herself a moment of solitude.  As she sat by the fire her thoughts turned to the events of the day. The refusal of Lord Borros was a setback but she could not dwell on it now Storms End might be a lost cause but mayhaps her brothers would have better luck.  Cregan Stark was said to be an honourable man and if he allied with her mother then the rest of the North would follow and Lady Jeyne Arryn was their kin it was doubtful she would turn against them.  Vaelyssa stood by the window gazing out into the stormy night. The rain pounded against the glass and the wind howled like a restless beast. The food the maids had recently brought was only partially eaten and the wine was bitter on her tongue.  Almost as if he sensed her unease Vermithor’s deafening roar pierced through the storm. His massive bronze-scaled form was a reassuring presence in the midst of her lingering uncertainty.  Almost immediately Vhagar answered with an equally impressive roar her call reverberating through the walls of Storm’s End.  Vaelyssa let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding seeing Aemond here had unsettled her and she couldn’t stop thinking of the look he had on his face when she announced that she was not free to marry it was the same look he’d given her when she stood next to Jacaerys in the throne room for the petition for Driftmark and again when she sat next to him at the feast.  Never had a man looked at her in that way before.  She began to undress her mind preoccupied with the events of the day and the challenges that lay ahead.  As she removed her outer garments the door to her chamber suddenly opened. Startled she turned to see Aemond standing there dressed in only a cotton shirt and leather trousers his tall figure framed by the flickering light of the torches in the hallway. He stepped quickly inside and shut the door making sure to lock it behind him.  “What do you want Aemond?” Vaelyssa demanded her voice steady but edged with irritation. “Leave or I will make you.”  Aemond’s lips curled into a smirk his single amethyst eye glinting with amusement. “The fight would be little challenge” he said his tone mocking.  “You clearly don’t know me very well” replied Vaelyssa he face growing hot as she noticed Aemond’s gaze sweeping over her pausing at her breasts which were no doubt visible through the thin material of her shift.  Aemond closed the distance between them a determined glint in his eye. “There is a debt to pay” he said his voice low as he reached up and removed his eyepatch revealing the sapphire embedded in the socket where his left eye had once been.  Clearly her uncle was trying to intimidate her but she would not fall for his provocations.  Vaelyssa scoffed crossing her arms over her chest. “Is that supposed to frighten me? Because I can tell you now that it doesn’t and neither does it impress me qȳbor” (Uncle).  Aemond’s jaw tightened his anger barely contained. “What if I demanded your eye in payment for the one I lost?” he asked.  Vaelyssa met his gaze unflinchingly her expression defiant. “Not my debt to pay and I thought your claim of Vhagar was worth the loss of an eye” she retorted. “Or is your hoary old bitch of a dragon no longer worth it?”  The insult hit its mark and Aemond’s face twisted with fury. His fists clenched at his sides.  “You dare speak of Vhagar that way?” he hissed his voice trembling with rage. “You know nothing of what it means to ride her to command the largest dragon in the world.”  “Tell me Aemond” she began her tone mocking “Do you truly believe the almighty Vhagar could withstand a combined attack from Vermithor Caraxes and Meleys? She might be the largest dragon in the world but even she is not invincible.”  Aemond simply stared at her his expression unreadable as he processed her words.  “You always seem so eager to remind everyone how large Vhagar is” said Vaelyssa a sly smile playing on her lips. “One might wonder if you’re trying to overcompensate for other-smaller matters.”  Aemond’s face twisted in anger once again “You think you’re so clever” he snarled his voice dripping with venom. “But your sharp tongue won’t save you from the reality of this war-your mother is not fit to rule.”  Vaelyssa’s eyes blazed with defiance as she met his gaze. &quot;And what about your precious Greens?” she shot back. “You cling to the throne like parasites. Your brother is nothing but a puppet and you Aemond are his most pathetic string.”  “You dare-“  “Tell me does it sting knowing that your older wastrel of a brother is given everything while you the dutiful son gets nothing?”  Aemond’s eye narrowed his lips pressed into a thin line. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”  “Oh but I do” Vaelyssa purred as she reached out and ran a finger down Aemond’s chest. “Tell me do you not envision yourself sitting upon the Iron Throne? Don’t you think yourself worthy to be King? Or are you content with always living in Aegon’s shadow?”  Aemond’s fists clenched his knuckles turning white. “You think you can provoke me with your petty words?”  “Petty?” Vaelyssa laughed a sharp mocking sound. “-I’m merely pointing out the obvious. You serve you obey you sacrifice and for what? To watch your drunken whoring wastrel of a brother wear the crown that you believe should have been yours?”  Aemond took a step forward his face contorted with anger. “Aegon is the King. That is the order of things.”  “The order of things?” Vaelyssa scoffed. “And you so loyal and dutiful never once imagined it differently? Never once thought that you could do better be better?”  Aemond’s eye blazed with fury and he took another menacing step toward her. “You presume too much”.  “Do I?” she challenged her voice cold and piercing. “Or is it that I’ve struck a nerve? You can lie to yourself Aemond but deep down you know the truth. You want the throne you crave it it is my mother’s by right she is the named heir”.  “Viserys changed his mind”.  “According to who?” snapped Vaelyssa her voice sharp and incredulous.  “My mother was tending to him in his final moments and he declared in her presence that he wished for Aegon to be King” said Aemond his tone defensive but resolute.  Vaelyssa’s eyes blazed with fury. “And my grandsire who that very same day dragged himself out of his sickbed to defend his daughter in front of the realm—only to change his mind hours later? Do me a favour” she retorted her voice dripping with scepticism.  “Are you calling my mother a liar?” Aemond’s singular eye narrowed his jaw tightening.  “My grandsire steadfastly upheld my mother’s status as his heir for over twenty years. He wouldn’t change his mind not like that” Vaelyssa said her voice firm with conviction.  Aemond’s face darkened with a mixture of anger and frustration. “You think I would lie about something like this?”  “You’ll believe what you want to in order to justify your actions-this entire situation reeks of Otto Hightowers manipulations after the death of my grandmother he shoved his own daughter under a grieving Kings nose and used her to further his own ambitions”.  “That’s not-“ muttered Aemond.  “-What happened? Of course it is. Even down his clever manipulation of Viserys. He played on my grandsire’s fears over my father and advocated for my mother to be named heir because he knew damn well that it would be easier to usurp a woman-”  “Daemon was too much of a risk-” said Aemond.  “The only risk was my father seeing Otto Hightower for what he really is-” snarled Vaelyssa.  “Loyal and unwavering-“  “A CUNT!” snarled Vaelyssa.  “Your language is unbecoming of a Princess-“  “I don’t give a flying fuck-your grandsire is nothing but an oath breaking cunt who seeks to reach far beyond his station and it’s not a question of if my mother takes back the Iron Throne it’s when and I can tell you that when she does your grandsire will find himself a head shorter and so will the other treasonous dogs who plotted against her”.  Aemond observed her for a moment a strange expression on his face before he seized her by the back of her neck pulling her close. His lips crashed into hers with a fierce almost brutal intensity. The kiss was rough a clash of wills a battle for dominance.  At first Vaelyssa was stunned her body rigid with surprise. But as the heat of the moment consumed her she found herself responding pulling him closer.  The initial shock melted away replaced by a fiery passion that surged through her veins. She returned the kiss with equal fervour their lips moving together in a furious dance.  Aemond’s grip on her neck tightened his other hand snaking around her waist to press her against him. Vaelyssa’s hands found their way to his chest her fingers curling into the fabric of his shirt as she pulled him even closer.  When they finally broke apart both were breathing heavily their faces flushed. Aemond’s eye burned with a mix of anger and desire and Vaelyssa’s own gaze mirrored that intensity.  “Is this what you wanted?” Aemond growled his voice low and rough. “To provoke me?”  Vaelyssa’s lips curled into a defiant smirk her breath still coming in ragged gasps. “Perhaps. Or maybe I just wanted to see if you truly were a dragon and not a slithering green Hightower snake.”  Aemond’s grip on her neck loosened slightly but he didn’t let go. “You’ve seen my fire” he murmured his voice softer but no less intense. “Now what will you do with it?”  In response Vaelyssa leaned in and kissed him again this time slower more deliberate. The passion between them didn’t wane; if anything it grew hotter more intense. The kiss was no longer a battle but a mutual surrender to the heat that had been building between them.  As they broke apart once more their foreheads resting against each other the reality of their situation began to seep back in. They were on opposite sides of a war bound by duty and loyalty to their respective causes. But in this moment none of that mattered. All that existed was the fire they had ignited between them.  “We are playing with fire Aemond” Vaelyssa whispered her voice tinged with a mixture of exhilaration and trepidation.  “Let it burn” Aemond replied his tone equally resolute. “Let it consume us both.”  Vaelyssa had lost most of her senses the moment Aemond had pressed her onto the bed and knelt down between her open legs.  “My niece-my sweetest-” whispered Aemond.  Vaelyssa’s eyes rolled into the back of her head as Aemond’s tongue swept across her slick wet folds.  She bit the back of her hand to keep herself from screaming as Aemond began using his long fingers to slowly tease her entrance.  “None of that. I want to hear how good I make you feel” growled Aemond as he began moving his tongue against her in rhythm with his fingers.  “A-Aemond. Oh god. Please” moaned Vaelyssa as she writhed against the sheets.  “I know your almost there. Let it happen. Come for me” whispered Aemond his tongue moving across her pearl.  Vaelyssa arched her back and let out a scream as her pleasure erupted.  Aemond slowly crawled up her body placing gentle kisses on her skin as he moved higher and higher.  Vaelyssa blushed furiously when she saw that Aemond’s chin was shining with her slick.  “Calm yourself issa zaldrīzes” muttered Aemond as he swiped his fingers over his chin and then placed them in his mouth sucking off her slick. (My dragon).  Goosebumps erupted over Vaelyssa’s skin as Aemond removed his hand from his mouth and then took hold of her breast his fingers teasing her rosy bud.  “A-Aemond” whimpered Vaelyssa.  “Sīr gevie” growled Aemond (So Beautiful).  “W-What are you doing?” asked Vaelyssa as Aemond’s hand slid down her body and began teasing her folds.  “I-I need to prepare you a little more” whispered Aemond.  “P-prepare me?” whispered Vaelyssa.  “I assume you are a maiden-I don’t want to hurt you” replied Aemond.  “Aemond” exclaimed Vaelyssa as he slowly slipped a finger inside her the slick from her first peak easing the way.  Aemond buried his face in Vaelyssa’s neck as he began peppering kisses along her smooth skin as he added another finger moving them in and out slowly.  “So warm-so wet for me” rasped Aemond his hot breath tickling her skin.  “I-I think I’m ready” whispered Vaelyssa.  Aemond removed his fingers and then moved between her open legs supporting his weight on his left arm as he reached down and took his hard cock in his hand and placed the tip of it against her slick entrance.  “A-Are you sure?”  “Yes-I want you Aemond-all of you” replied Vaelyssa as she felt him running his cock along her entrance.  “Y-You must tell me if it hurts” whispered Aemond.  Vaelyssa nodded and shut her eyes tight taking a deep breath as Aemond sheathed himself within her.  “Your doing so well-” muttered Aemond trying to control himself.  “I-It h-hurts-“ whimpered Vaelyssa the burning sensation bringing tears to her eyes.  “If it’s too much I can pull out-” offered Aemond.  “N-No just give me a moment” replied Vaelyssa softly as the tears ran down her cheeks.  Aemond leaned down and pressed gentle kisses to her cheeks his tongue catching her fallen tears.  Aemond’s cock twitched and throbbed with need and he released a shuddered breath while Vaelyssa sighed in relief.   “Are you ok?” asked Aemond.  “I-I think you can move now” whispered Vaelyssa her hands running along the smooth plans of Aemond’s back.  Slowly Aemond withdrew and then moved forward his cock reaching deep inside her.  “Are you ok?” repeated Aemond as he thrust inside her.  “Y-yes-I think you can move faster”.  Aemond rested his head in the crook of her neck as he thrusts faster his moans muffled against her skin.  “Ooh Aemond-that feels good” whined Vaelyssa.  “Your perfect-” whispered Aemond.  Feeling a spark of pleasure Vaelyssa dug her fingers into Aemonds back holding him close.  “P-please Aemond. F-faster. H-harder” exclaimed Vaelyssa.  “Lyssa-” moaned Aemond as he began to pound into her his hips slapping against hers.  “-I-I f-feel-” whimpered Vaelyssa an odd sensation creeping across her stomach.  “-Let it happen-my sweetest peak for me” exclaimed Aemond.  “OH-”  “Fuck-that’s it-that’s it” muttered Aemond as he slipped his hand between their bodies and slowly began rubbing her pearl.  “AEMOND” screamed Vaelyssa as her peak exploded making her entire body shake.  “I-I’m going to give you my seed-see you all round and swollen with my child-your breasts filled with milk” moaned Aemond.  “Yes-yes. Aemond. I want it-” babbled Vaelyssa as his thrusts became more frantic.  “Fuck-” groaned Aemond as he felt the heat shooting across his abdomen.  “-Aemond” whimpered Vaelyssa.  “ñuhon ry ñuhon” moaned Aemond pushed into the hilt for one last time his cock throbbing as he spilled rope after rope of his seed (Mine all mine).  “Ry aōhon” whispered Vaelyssa as Aemond rested on top of her (All yours).  “A-Are you ok?” Aemond as he gently pulled his softened cock from Vaelyssa he looked down and saw the mixture of his seed and her maidens blood dripping onto the sheet.  Vaelyssa nodded slowly as she allowed him to enfold her in his arms and hold her close.  “What happens now?” asked Vaelyssa softly her voice tinged with uncertainty. “Are we just to go back to being enemies in the morning?”  Aemond hesitated for a moment his fingers tracing absent patterns on her bare shoulder. “No” he replied finally his voice low and steady. “I will accompany you to Dragonstone and declare for Rhaenyra.”  Vaelyssa’s eyes widened in surprise her heart skipping a beat. “You-you would declare for my mother?” she asked incredulous.  Aemond nodded his expression serious. “Yes” he affirmed. “For you.”  Vaelyssa searched his face trying to comprehend his sudden change of allegiance. “Why Aemond?” she pressed gently. “Why would you do that?”  “Nyke jaelagon naejot dīnagon ao” replied Aemond (I wish to marry you).  “My father will have his sword at your neck the moment you leave Vhagar’s side”.  “That maybe so but surely your mother will see the benefits of our union without Vhagar Kings Landing is vulnerable and my brother’s position as King will be weakened no doubt your father’s bloodlust will be sated by rooting out the traitors who conspired against his Queen-” said Aemond.  “-If you declare for her then she is to be your Queen as well” muttered Vaelyssa.  “Only if she accepts my request for your hand in marriage“ admitted Aemond his voice tinged with a hint of vulnerability. ”-And by our marriage one day I will be King.“  Vaelyssa blinked processing his words. &quot;Is that what this is? You desire the throne and your using me to get it” she asked quietly her mind racing with the implications of his confession and admittedly the thought of him using her did sting.  “Do you remember when we were children when everyone else had their dragons and we only had each other”  “Yes” muttered Vaelyssa softly.  “-How I used to steal honey cakes for you and then we’d sit under the weirwood tree dreaming of our future-”  “What does that have to do with anything?” asked Vaelyssa.  “My vision for the future was of us-together. We have always been fated bound by more than blood. You label me Hightower but I am a dragon and I have found my treasure. We belong together you and I” muttered Aemond.  “-And the throne?” asked Vaelyssa.  Aemond sighed brushing a strand of hair away from her face. ”-I do want to be King but only with you by my side as my Queen&quot;.  “Your ambitious I’ll give you that-but why not just displace Aegon?” mused Vaelyssa.  “When you steal something you spend your whole life fighting to keep it. I want a legitimate route to the throne through the bonds of marriage”.  “What about your betrothal to one of Borros Baratheon’s daughters?” she asked softly her fingers tracing patterns on Aemond’s chest. “He might see it as an insult that you promised to wed one of his daughters yet you plan to take another to wife.”  Aemond scoffed a smirk playing on his lips. “A boar is nothing compared to a dragon” he said dismissively. “Lord Borros can be placated. If your mother accepts my terms she can make the necessary arrangements for a marriage between Floris and some lord of note.”  Vaelyssa couldn’t help but smile at his confidence but she knew the complexities of politics couldn’t be brushed aside so easily. “And you believe Lord Borros will simply accept this?”  Aemond’s expression turned serious. “He is ambitious but he is also pragmatic. An alliance with House Targaryen especially one that strengthens Rhaenyra’s claim would be more valuable than a slighted promise. Besides Rhaenyra can offer him a position on the council and favourable marriages for his other daughters. He will not refuse such a boon”.  Vaelyssa nodded slowly considering his words. “You have given this a great deal of thought” she admitted. “But there may be other who whisper of false promises”.  “Let them” Aemond replied with a shrug. “The realm is on the brink of war. Loyalties will shift alliances will be made and broken. In the end what matters is who sits on the Iron Throne”.  “One might think you’ve been planning this for years.”  Aemond’s gaze was intense as he held hers. “I have” he admitted his voice low and fervent. “You are all I’ve wanted since I was old enough to know the ache of wants and desires. My grandsire usurping the throne convinced me that my dream would no longer be achievable and that placing the wants and needs of others above my own desires was something I would just have to accept.”  He paused his fingers tracing the contours of her face. “But your arrival at Storm’s End was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. I am a determined man Vaelyssa and I learned long ago that nothing was ever going to be handed to me. If I wanted something then I would have to take it.”  Vaelyssa’s breath caught in her throat at his confession. “You would risk everything for this?” she asked her voice barely above a whisper. “For us?”  Aemond nodded his expression resolute. “Yes. I would. Because for the first time I see a path to the life I’ve always wanted. A life where I am not just the second son where I am not bound by the whims of others. A life with you-providing of course that your mother accepts all of my terms-”  “What exactly are all of your terms Aemond?” asked Vaelyssa curiously.  Aemond met her eyes his expression resolute. “If Rhaenyra wants me to bend the knee to her then she will allow us to marry” he stated firmly. “Our union will strengthen her claim and bring House Targaryen closer together just as my dearly departed father always wanted-”  Vaelyssa nodded slowly “And what else?” she prompted.  Aemond’s features softened slightly a hint of vulnerability showing through his stern facade. “I want assurances that my family will be safe” he said his voice quiet but determined. “-My mother Aegon Helaena their children and Daeron—no harm will come to them. They must be allowed to live in peace.”  “You will not advocate for your grandsire?” asked Vaelyssa.  “No-”  “Just as well as my father wouldn’t allow him to live not after what he’s done” replied Vaelyssa.  “Your father isn’t my only concern your mother-” said Aemond.  “-My mother is not the monster you believe her to be” she began her voice gentle yet firm. “Only those who actively repudiated the succession and conspired against her will be dealt with.”  Aemond scoffed a hint of bitterness in his tone. “Did she not demand that I be sharply questioned as a child?” he retorted his voice growing colder. “To learn where I heard such slanders against her children—slanders which by the way are true.”  Vaelyssa’s expression softened a mix of sadness and determination in her eyes. “It doesn’t matter” she said quietly but firmly. “Laenor claimed us as his children so therefore in the eyes of gods and men we are his. He loved us as his cared for us as his.”  Aemond shook his head his frustration evident. “The truth is plain to see when it comes to your brothers at least Rhaenyra’s claim to the throne is weakened by those lies.”  Vaelyssa took a deep breath her hand reaching out to touch his arm. “The truth of our parentage does not change the fact that we are my mother’s children and Laenor’s by law. We have the right to be acknowledged and accepted. We cannot let old grudges and suspicions destroy what we are trying to build.”  Aemond’s eye softened slightly though his jaw remained tense. “You ask much of me Vaelyssa. To overlook what I know to be true to forgive and forget what happened”.  Vaelyssa took a deep breath looking into Aemond’s eye with a mixture of sorrow and determination. “I am not asking you to forgive Luke for what he took from you” she began softly. “But I am asking for an understanding that all were in the wrong that night. Your claiming of Vhagar was ill-timed at the funeral of her previous rider no less. You could have waited—but I understand. I know that feeling of not being enough of having an egg that doesn’t hatch-you weren’t the only one to be mocked for not having a dragon-”  Aemond’s expression hardened slightly but he listened intently his jaw tense.  ”-Vhagar chose you for a reason just as my bronze fury chose me&quot; Vaelyssa continued her voice steady. “Your claim of her should have been celebrated not marred by conflict. The fight shouldn’t have happened. You shouldn’t have tried to bash Jace’s head in with a rock and Luke shouldn’t have taken your eye. But he was scared and only wanted to defend his brother.”  Aemond looked away a mix of emotions playing across his face—anger pain regret. “That night changed everything” he murmured his voice barely audible.  Vaelyssa nodded her hand reaching out to gently touch his. “It did” she agreed. “And we cannot change what happened. But we can choose how we move forward. We can choose to understand each other’s pain to acknowledge the mistakes that were made.”  Aemond turned back to her his eye searching hers for sincerity. “And what then?” he asked his voice tinged with bitterness. “Do we simply forget? Pretend it never happened?”  “No” Vaelyssa said firmly. “We remember but we also strive to be better. To not let the past dictate our future. We use our pain our experiences to guide us in making wiser decisions in fostering a realm where our future children won’t have to face the same heartaches.”  Aemond’s gaze softened slightly a hint of vulnerability breaking through his hardened exterior. “It’s not easy” he admitted his voice thick with emotion. “To let go of the anger the need for vengeance.”  “I know” Vaelyssa whispered squeezing his hand. “But we have to try. For us for our future and for the realm. We can’t let the mistakes of our past define who we are now or who we can become look at what it’s done to those who came before us-We must be the ones to break the cycle or it will just keep happening until there is nothing left of House Targaryen”  Aemond’s expression shifted as he absorbed Vaelyssa’s words. A flicker of amusement danced in his eye and he leaned closer a teasing smirk curling his lips. “Our future children you say?” he remarked his tone playful.  Vaelyssa blinked momentarily taken aback. “I’m trying to be sensible here and that’s what you focus on?” she retorted a hint of exasperation in her voice.  Aemond’s smirk widened a glint of mischief in his eye. “I quite like the idea of seeing you swelling with my seed” he murmured his voice dropping to a low intimate whisper. “Being all full of me. I think we should do all we can to ensure my seed takes”.  Vaelyssa’s cheeks flushed with a mix of embarrassment and arousal a shiver running down her spine at his words.  She opened her mouth to reply but found herself momentarily speechless as she felt Aemond’s hard cock pressed against her hip.  “Pār gūrogon issa tepagon issa aōha nūmo se nyke shall tepagon ao nykeā tresy””muttered Vaelyssa as she coiled her hands in Aemond’s long silver hair (Then take me give me your seed and I shall give you a son).  “Nyke jāhor emagon ao naenie jēdi bisa bantis” growled Aemond as he rolled on top of her (I will have you many times this night).  “Hae naenie jēdi hae ao jaelagon issa dārys” (As many times as you wish my King).  The morning sun broke through the clouds casting a golden glow over Storm’s End. The storm had cleared leaving the air crisp and fresh.  Vaelyssa stood beside Vermithor her hands resting on his warm rough scales her cheek pressed against him. ”Jēda naejot jikagon lenton issa dōna“ she murmured softly (Time to go home my sweet).  Vermithor trilled happily a low rumbling sound that reverberated through her bones.  She took a deep breath savouring the moment of calm before the journey ahead. As she glanced over she saw Aemond climbing the rope ladder attached to Vhagar’s saddle his movements confident and swift.  He caught her eye and gave a slight nod a hint of a smile playing on his lips. Vaelyssa couldn’t help but smile back feeling the dull throbbing sensation between her legs—a reminder of the night they had shared.  Aemond had made good on his promise his appetite for her had been ravenous he kissed sucked licked and fucked her well into the hours of the night. Never fully satisfied until he’d filled her with his seed another three times.  Even just this morning he had reached for her again; he had refused to let her bathe afterwards and had worked himself into such a frenzy at the thought of her returning to Dragonstone with his seed dripping from her that he bent her over the small desk and fucked her hard and fast. His fingers digging into her hips as he lost himself to the pleasure he sought his loud moans echoing around the room as he spilled himself inside her.  She placed a hand on her stomach and wondered if his seed had already taken root. She’d had her moonblood a fortnight ago and she would not take moontea so there was a chance.  Her thoughts then turned to her mother. She had been sent to secure Borros Baratheon’s support but she was returning to Dragonstone with a far greater alliance.  Vaelyssa wondered how her mother would react to the news. Would she see the wisdom in their union the strength it would bring to her cause? Or would she be wary of the potential complications?  Vaelyssa knew one thing for certain: she had to convince her mother of the value of this alliance. She stroked Vermithor’s scales one last time before stepping back ready to mount.  Aemond was now settled atop Vhagar his gaze steady and unwavering as he watched her. Vaelyssa climbed onto Vermithor’s back her movements graceful and practiced. She looked over at Aemond one more time a mixture of resolve and tenderness in her eyes.  &quot;Ready?” Aemond called out his voice carrying over the morning breeze.  Vaelyssa finished securing the straps of her saddle and nodded her heart pounding with anticipation. “Ready.”  With a synchronized roar Vermithor and Vhagar spread their massive wings the powerful beats stirring up the air around them. They took to the sky the ground falling away beneath them as they soared higher and higher.  As they flew side by side Vaelyssa felt a sense of exhilaration and determination. She was not just returning to Dragonstone with a message; she was bringing back a promise of unity a chance for a brighter future.  The wind rushed past her and she closed her eyes for a moment envisioning the world they could build together—a world where their children would grow up in peace and prosperity.  Opening her eyes she looked over at Aemond once more their paths now intertwined by fate and choice. Together they would face the challenges ahead and together they would shape the destiny of their house and their realm.  Vermithor and Vhagar circled Dragonstone in wide arcs their loud roars echoing across the cliffs and the surrounding sea announcing their arrival to all within earshot.  As the two dragons descended their enormous wings created gusts of wind that swept across the grassy cliffs.  They landed with resounding thuds the ground trembling beneath their combined weight. Vaelyssa swiftly unlatched herself from Vermithor’s saddle her movements practiced and fluid. She slid down his side and landed gracefully on the ground her gaze turning to Aemond.  Aemond climbed down the rope ladder attached to Vhagar’s saddle his every movement exuding a calm confidence. When he reached the ground he immediately sought out Vaelyssa his eye locking onto hers. He crossed the short distance between them and took her hand in his squeezing it gently.  The pair stood firm side by side as they awaited the arrival of her mother and father.  It wasn’t very long before the unmistaken shuffle and clang of armour permeated through the air.  Her mother and father were slowly making their way towards them surrounded by the Queens guard.  Daemon’s hand as always rested on the hilt of his sword his gaze was sharp and assessing taking in the sight of Aemond standing beside Vaelyssa.  The golden crown atop Rhaenyra’s head shone brilliantly in the sunlight a symbol of her rightful claim to the throne and the burden of the responsibility she bore.  As Rhaenyra neared her expression one of regal composure mixed with a hint of curiosity and concern as Aemond’s grip on Vaelyssa’s hand tightened.  “Mother” Vaelyssa greeted her voice steady though she felt the flutter of nerves in her chest.  Rhaenyra’s eyes softened as she looked at her daughter but her gaze quickly shifted to Aemond a mixture of suspicion and curiosity evident. “Vaelyssa” she acknowledged.  Daemon stepped forward his gaze flicking between the two. &quot;Why is that Hightower cunt here” he asked his voice carrying an edge of scepticism.  Vaelyssa took a deep breath standing taller. &quot;Please Father let me explain-” she began her voice strong. “As you know I was sent to secure Lord Borros Baratheon’s support-but instead I have returned with an even greater alliance.”  Daemon’s eyes narrowed slightly his gaze locking onto Aemond. “Explain” he commanded his tone leaving no room for evasion.  Aemond let go of Vaelyssa’s hand and stepped forward he unsheathed his sword and dropped to one knee.  “I Aemond of House Targaryen pledge my loyalty and that of Vhagar to you Queen Rhaenyra of House Targaryen the First of Her Name Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men Lady of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm-”  Daemon’s gaze bore into Aemond with a piercing intensity his hand still resting on the hilt of his sword. “And what assurance do we have that this isn’t some ploy?” he demanded his voice edged with scepticism. “How do we know you’re not seeking to gain our trust only to betray us later?”  Aemond met Daemon’s challenging stare his expression resolute &quot;I swear upon my honour” he declared firmly his voice carrying across the tense silence “My intentions are honest. I wish no harm to Queen Rhaenyra or her rule”.  Vaelyssa stepped forward her voice joining Aemond’s in earnest plea. &quot;Father please” she urged her eyes pleading with Daemon. “Aemond has shown his commitment. He risked much to declare his support openly. We must consider the alliance this could bring.”  Daemon’s expression softened slightly as he regarded his daughter then turned back to Aemond. “Words are wind” he stated bluntly his tone challenging. “Actions speak louder. What will you do to prove your loyalty boy?”  Aemond’s jaw clenched briefly before he spoke his voice steady and unwavering. “I will swear any oath undergo any trial to prove my sincerity” he replied his gaze locked with Daemon’s.  Rhaenyra who had been observing the exchange with a measured silence finally spoke. “Daemon let us hear him” she said softly her eyes never leaving Aemond’s face. “Let us hear what he proposes.”  Daemon considered his wife’s words then nodded slowly. “Very well” he agreed his voice gruff. “Speak Aemond. What oath will you swear to prove your loyalty to the rightful Queen?”  Aemond straightened the weight of the moment heavy upon him. He rose to his feet and took a step forward his gaze unwavering as he addressed the Queen and her consort. “I swear by the old gods-” he began solemnly “-that I will serve the rightful Queen with unwavering loyalty and devotion.”  A murmur rippled through the Queen’s Guard and Rhaenyra raised a hand to silence them her eyes never leaving Aemond’s face. “And what do you seek in return?” she asked her voice cool and measured.  Aemond glanced at Vaelyssa drawing strength from her presence. “I ask for your daughter’s hand in marriage” he said clearly. “And assurances that my family—my mother my siblings and their children—will be kept safe and unharmed.”  “And why do you not advocate for your grandsire?” Rhaenyra questioned; her voice measured.  Aemond met her gaze evenly. “Because it would be a pointless endeavour- he actively conspired against you” he replied firmly.  Daemon’s voice cut through the silence that followed. “Who were Otto’s co-conspirators?” he demanded his tone sharp and demanding. “There is no way he acted alone. Speak the truth boy-”  Aemond’s jaw tightened briefly his resolve unwavering. “I will name those I know of” he answered his voice steady. “But I cannot guarantee it is an exhaustive list.”  He took a breath and began each name a weighty admission in the cold air. “Tyland Lannister” he stated plainly his gaze flicking briefly to Vaelyssa &quot;As well as Jasper Wylde Maester Orwyle and Larys Strong-”  “I shall see everyone of those traitorous cunts suffer for this-” snarled Daemon his knuckles turning white as he tightly gripped the hilt of Dark Sister.  Rhaenyra considered Aemond’s words carefully and finally after what felt like an eternity she spoke.  &quot;I agree to your terms brother-” Rhaenyra declared her voice resonating with authority. “I will guarantee the safety of Alicent Aegon Helaena their children and Daeron.”  Aemond’s expression softened slightly a flicker of relief crossing his features. Beside him Vaelyssa’s eyes shone with gratitude and hope.  “But-” Rhaenyra continued her tone firm “-Only when I have reclaimed the Iron Throne will I permit you and Vaelyssa to marry. For now you will be betrothed as a pledge of our alliance.”  Aemond bowed his head respectfully. “Gratitude-Your Grace”  &quot;Now the two of you will be escorted inside-” Rhaenyra announced her voice commanding yet tinged with a touch of warmth. “-Baths will be prepared. You both smell of dragon”  Vaelyssa and Aemond exchanged a glance their expressions reflecting a mixture of relief and anticipation. “Of course Your Grace” Aemond responded respectfully.  “And I expect the both of you at dinner tonight” Rhaenyra added firmly her eyes shifting between them to emphasize her expectations.  “Yes mother-” Vaelyssa affirmed with a nod her voice steady despite the whirlwind of emotions within her.  As they turned to make their way back toward Dragonstone Daemon halted Vaelyssa with a gentle yet firm grasp on her arm.  Aemond hesitated momentarily but Vaelyssa reassured him with a reassuring glance and a soft-spoken promise to join him shortly. He nodded and followed Rhaenyra and the Queen’s Guard towards the castle.  Alone with her father Vaelyssa felt a surge of pride mingled with a touch of vulnerability as Daemon gently took her face in his hands and turned her head to the side to see the various love bites that graced her skin.  &quot;Well done-” muttered Daemon his voice gruff yet tinged with unmistakable approval.  Vaelyssa smiled her heart swelling with gratitude at his words. &quot;I learned from the best”,2024-07-13 12:27:42 GMT

Have fun reading :)  masterlist  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Aemond x younger!reader  SFW °If his wife was younger than him and he was only a few years older what he feels would be love but it would be different. He would be someone else not a broken boy he was the prince of the realm a Targaryen with the greatest dragon that lived he was someone of strength and power who trusted in his abilities and protected his wife. Because that was something a husband did a prince did. Taking care of his beloved fulfilling his duties and raising his own family to join the royal family.  °Duties that quickly turned out to be something else. Since the betrothal a few days after his father’s death he knew it was necessary. Knew that it would serve the kingdom if he himself entered into a political marriage since his siblings had already done their duty. I know you will do better Aemond&quot; he had his mother’s words always in his mind as she looked at him had the ceremonial clothes on him and put the finishing touches before he would take his betrothed as his wife. A marriage that was sealed with a kiss and an exchange of cloaks hopeful eyes looking at him a hand on his back and a prince playing his part. A role he took on from his uncle. Someone who was someone in this family who was the image of the dragon of a full-blooded Targaryen.  °The wedding night after the feast he had clearly insisted on not putting on a public show had gotten support from his own brother even if it bothered him he knew he owed him a thank you for not making a public spectacle of it Have thanks my lord husband&quot; he had heard her uncertain voice as her hand closed firmly around his she had expected the worst but he would not let that happen. His wife was his her body was for his sight and no one else’s. One thing he made her feel was that his politeness and formality only dropped when they were alone and he allowed himself to show her his other side. She realized that he was a prince with desires and other sides but never quite let her get close to him didn’t he because of her looks? Because of her reputation? Or because of something else in him?  °He never let her know never let her know what it was in him that sometimes led him away from her like a stranger only to place himself with her like someone dutiful. The kisses in public were almost shy and brief their hands only touched through gloves and they spent time together in the library. He enjoyed reading the things of the story with her and she confessed to him with warm cheeks You are a man of honor and duty even on the training ground…it makes me happy to see you win&quot; and he couldn’t hide the smirk on his lips. She never asked him for anything but this knowledge that she admired him appreciated his skills his strength on the arena and seemed to ignore his brother completely delighted him. If it excites my lady such a thing shall happen often“ he murmured placing a kiss on the back of her hand before rising from the library and making his way to his brother.  °Tournaments fights training exercises victories and nothing but victories brought the prince of the realm a new armor was forged for him and he always received the blessing from his wife who cheered him on and felt nothing but joy that she could finally give her husband something something that filled him with something that she could not it replaced the one inside him. The satisfaction of victory outweighed his painful past but he never took off even his eye patch he had never been afraid of his mother whom he had protected for years so he would not do the same with his wife a woman who in some lights reminded him of his own mother…someone he could and would save now someone who belonged to him and not to his brother someone for whom he was good enough and who was his. It was during this time that something between them grew like dragon fire and he found himself more and more often in her rooms late at night to talk to read to eat together or to take flights on Vhagar where he could show her again what he would do what he was capable of…until the prince too had to give in to his lust at some point in an approaching war that kept his nerves short….  NSFW  °The lust one day overcame him it was not the other he was looking for on the contrary with every time he left the council with every time his grandfather or his mother forbade him to fly with Vhagar his dissatisfaction grew. With every victory the adrenaline rushed through his body but he couldn’t go into the silken path with it it would destroy the image unsettle his inner self. It was on these days that he finally turned physically to his wife at night when the moon was high in the sky and he came into her room. Aemond? Is everything all right?” her question fell from her lips as she saw her husband standing in her room his dark leather clothes smelling of fire and smoke her swords and blood around him like a fight. But his body was shaking it was the adrenaline running through his body after what he had done what Vhagar had done what the prince could not prevent…he just had to calm down. He had to turn to his wife and not let her finish talking ignoring her worries and barely taking off his clothes he joined her on the bed. Skilled fingers rough and cool through the night that pushed up her nightgown and pulled her closer and a kiss that set the night in motion.  °The kiss that set everything in motion a kiss from his desperation to feel something warm and soft. Not the hold of a center no he brought his wife to his body a cunt in which he could give his pleasure in a time that could be the last of his family. You need me“ he murmured words he wanted to pass around but it was true that every dragon felt comfortable in fire. Her clothes slid to the ground his would never follow the warm leather the cool metal of the buckles on her body an alternation of ice and fire as he pressed her body against his.  °Her hands trembled unsteadily from the furs and blankets to his body her voice asking questions and words devoured by his lips as he kissed her squeezing her breasts with his hands savoring the pleasure of her body for what she gave him. All because of me” he murmured letting his lips trail down hers feeling her quiver of pleasure her first few nights not unlike this one. His own arousal for her was consuming his wife his beloved object. He heard her nod at his words she was his and would be his alone and no one else’s not his brother’s not his father’s not his uncle&#x27;s…she was his alone.  °She would serve him as an object of love and affection as he consciously turned her around her body her mind leaning into the pillows understanding her lustful gaze sire knew how he wanted it. One last look a kiss followed by a bite on her shoulder before he thrust into her her moans drowning in the pillows the sounds muffled through the room as he fucked her into the mattress his hands tangled in her hair her back already covered in his kisses and rubs. Did you fuck her like a hound? he couldn’t help but think of his brother’s humiliating question but it was true he took her like a dog in the heat he needed and wanted her in a completely different way than in his visit to the silk.  °Once again he did something like his brother gave in to physical love but what would follow moments later when his thrusts became firmer and uncontrolled and he came inside her with a grunting shudder he had the tea brought to her a few hours later as he did every time. He wouldn’t give the curse of the second born to his offspring and as long as she lived with the old dream of not being able to give him children it was a good thing…because his power was perhaps what kept him with her in the end she was his and she would never change that.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Aemond x older!reader  SFW  °If his wife was older and he was a few years younger it would be completely different. It was his duty to marry of course a politically strategic marriage but what else could it be in times of freedom he might at least have been allowed to choose his wife but now to take directly a lady of her own house. The only successor to her late lord father who had died a few weeks earlier before all of Westeros would be plunged into war there was no better option and with his younger brother in Oldtwon there was only him to make a decision that could not be changed. But the meeting was something else her followers and a small army of a few thousand men were formidable but also an amalgamation of Houses beneath her. A lady of power in her own domain facing the prince of the kingdom with the greatest dragon a marriage that Aemond felt was something else.  °His mother was glad that she could not even use her children but rather could now slowly watch the game for herself. While it was Aemond who knew he was the dragon’s true blood his brother should be whining and neglecting their shared sister but Aemond had found his own wife his own lady…his own special piece in this world. I will not disappoint you&quot; was the only thing he would say to his mother before the marriage and the ceremony he knew he could never disappoint his mother like Aegon but he wouldn’t when he faced her. A pair of eyes fixed on him not hating him or looking down on him she seemed to like him at least he hoped so as he felt her soft hands in his How nice to see my prince husband smile…I feared not to please you&quot; her words reaching him as she was transported in the carriage from the sept back to the castle her gaze was crossed by a brief streak of sadness. He had smiled a soft smile on his lips as he had looked at her for reasons he knew exactly why. You please me my lady wife don’t worry my being is yours&quot; he assured her and gave her another uplifting look before turning his battered face away from her.  °It was a wedding a feast even if it was celebrated beautifully and lavishly not least because of his brother’s befegl he could feel the eyes of the others on him. A young prince of the realm at the beginning of the prime of his life barely more than half his twenty name days and his wife a rose already blossoming in the mid-thirties of her name day. He was almost pitied from outside it seemed to him but when he looked at his brother he saw no amusement no wit Aegon too drunk to care about his sister-in-law’s age. He did not see what was really going on in his brother’s mind as the ceremony of the first night approached a night that would be carried out discreetly in his chamber together and alone through Aemond’s sharp words and threats. A night that was full of physical lust but they both seemed to recognize that it was not the real thing at least for now.  °But days and weeks after their marriage this hardly mattered he avoided and clung to her as his comfort required. He had new clothes made for her jewelry gifts all his favorite colors and metals but all relatively the same as his mother’s not that anyone particularly noticed the second prince of the realm had no interest in the gossip of the people but also the gossip about him remained absent but his brother the king was always the better. When he didn’t retire to his room during the day to work out plans with Criston that his brother wouldn’t be able to do he trained and above all sought her “closeness”. A closeness in which he could observe her like a beautiful creature in a cage even if he was the dragon trapped in a pit of his own emotions. He caught himself smiling when he saw her again in simple activities whether it was reading books or embroidering with his sister it made him happy to see her so honest.  °But the more often he saw her talked to her and looked at her in her green and gold clothes the more often he realized at night when his thoughts strayed from the battle strategies and the memories of the past came flooding in that she was someone he needed. An realization that would soon lead to results not only when he was sent to Storms End and met his bastard nephew Lucery but also when Vhagar pounced on him without his prompting. It was on this rainy night that the good prince’s façade cracked his duties were laid aside and the prince still completely wet and with trembling hands that he had clenched into fists in small council now trembled as he closed the door behind him. His wife sitting in bed with candles lit on the bedside table discovered him Aemond? What happened?“ her question reached him but it was not a prince who answered as his shoulders closed in on her…it was a broken man seeking comfort in the arms of his false mother.  NSFW  °Without a word he went to her bedside and she sat down on the edge of the bed looking at him her eyes wandering over his body. The wet clothes the hair sticking to his skin his trembling hands and the look in one eye…a look of desire and fear a look of shame and devotion. But it was her she was the right one for him when his wife his beloved lady his false mother took care of him in a situation that was presented to her almost as a gift. Her fingers went to his clothes and the pieces slid close and close with a cold shiver as he was gradually undressed and he ended up standing naked in front of her a sight not unfamiliar to her but the shivering she mistook for freezing was something else for him as her attempt to warm him with a fur was different than she thought.  °Instead he interrupted her movement and came closer to her causing her to pull herself back onto the bed slowly understanding what he wanted. She positioned herself at the head of the bed placing a pillow in her back to make it more comfortable as her husband positioned himself in her lap placing his head on her chest and listening to her heartbeat which gradually calmed down as her observation and premonition turned out to be true. When the prince closed his eyes let out an almost heavy sigh and just lay there for a moment Please I-my Lady….Mother please just hold me” she heard his voice as she was about to put the blanket over them both when she paused in her movement and put her hand on his head. His wet hair wet her fingers and she continued while the images of a mother and her son could not have been more symbolic with the exception of his arousal the arousal of a man and not that of a broken boy as he saw himself in her arms.  °She felt his lust in him corrupted by fear and pain and she could help him…she was the one who could do something now who finally had power after everything and not just because of him. He had helped her to power but at the end of the night as she saw it she was the one who restrained and controlled the dragon. It’s okay…my prince-my boy…mom couldn’t be prouder of you…get some rest you’ve earned it you’ve been so good&quot; she mumbled to him words that were said to boys to children who still needed encouragement who should feel proud when they did little things but a man shouldn’t hear such things…but then did she even have a man lying in her womb?   °She wasn’t sure but her heartbeat responding to his arousal his body in her womb was something she wouldn’t believe and certainly not when Ameond started to move and she saw what he was doing. With warm pink cheeks in contrast to his sapphire in one eye he looked up at her and she stroked his cheek Thank you“ was the last thing he mumbled before his fingers seemed to struggle awkwardly with the lacing and full of insecurity until she helped him and opened her own front lacing sliding her nightgown slightly open and showing him her chest. Aemond slowly repositioned himself his head which had been resting on her chest before placed itself in front of her breast the coldness of the night he brought with him sending a shiver down her spine as she felt his tongue on her sensitive nipple Ae-Aemond gently” she ordered softly stroking his head as his other hand placed itself on her other breast. Now he didn’t seem to mind that after the nights they had spent together her body had changed in contrast to what had been a day of disinterest and brief questions about her well-being now that her body was changing with a child it was just about the most divine thing he could have.   °She felt him greedily lapping at her nipples before she heard his satisfied sigh as he seemingly tasted her milk his teeth pulling at it before he apologetically lapped and sucked again. All the while she held him and told him how good and good he was stroking his head and pulling on the light strands every now and then when he was too sleepy and she saw his apologetic look but his arousal didn’t diminish and she knew this was more than just an interaction. She knew that he needed her knew that she had her dragon now as her hand went to his lap her fingers moving rhythmically pressing him even closer the scent warm and soft of a woman a mother enveloping him more and more as he massaged her breasts and sucked on her nipples.  °His hips moved slowly with her movements and soon found a rhythm that suited the prince but she pretended to punish him by biting him too hard Ah Aemond…remember it will be enough&quot; she murmured and stroked his lips with her thumbs as he let go of her for a moment his sapphire eye also slightly pained to close as she brushed his slightly moist milk-slicked lips over. He laid his head in the palm of her hand and cuddled up to her before she allowed him to return and they stayed like that for a few moments before she felt him slowly come closer to his climax he squeezed her breasts tightly with his fingernails and the whimper came over her lips as she allowed him to come. That’s it“ she said to him last as his slightly quivering body relaxed in her lap and he closed his eyes as he left the last kisses on her breasts before he allowed her to cover him with the blanket and furs and let him slip away limply but his wife stayed behind holding her husband in her arms and wiping his cum on the pillow Sleep well I know you’ll need me again soon…my dear husband” she said to him as she watched over him her sleep a small price for what she got in return besides love and lust a dragon and a prospect of a whole new side to the game of throne and the victory of war.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  @dixie-elocin  @hufflepuffkittysworld  @girlypieee,2024-07-13 14:35:02 GMT

Daenys Baela and Rhaena erupt into laughter at the finale of the story. They had been secluded in a room and idly snacking and drinking wine. Daenys unfortunately was not able to participate in the feasting on account of her dress fitting. She stood on a raised dias in the room sucking in her stomach and praying for her release. There was no denying her eagerness to marry Ben but the dress fitting she could do without.  It was the day before her marriage ceremony to Benjicot and she was being put through one final check of her dress. Rhaenyra used the excuse of making sure everything was made perfect before the big day but truly she wanted to spend as much time with her daughter as possible until her departure to Raventree Hall. Their afternoon was spent talking of gossip and excitement for the wedding.   The main dressmaker bowed to Rhaenyra “The dress is complete princess.”   Daenys resisted to urge to sigh loudly for her feet were tired from standing for hours. She immediately marched behind one of the dividers in the room and began to get out of the dress with the help of some handmaids. By the time she had gotten ready again the dressmaker was gone and the maids followed.  Daenys went to the lounge area where all the women were talking. Baela already had a goblet of wine poured for her and passed it into her hand when she sat down with them. Daenys gave her stepsister a thankful smile before taking a sip.   “Do you have any more wild stories like that?” Rhaena asked as she picked up a grape from the silver platter on the table and popped it into her mouth.   “Oh well it depends on your definition of wild my dear” Rhaenyra responded. She leaned back in her chair and gently rubbed her stomach. Her pregnancy had progressed well with little discomfort or worry from the maester. It would only be a few months until the infant is expected to come.   “Surely you have a story to rival the one from before?” Baela joined her sister in prodding for information. Daenys took a sip from her cup while her mother spoke.   “I do have one story with a Blackwood.” Daenys choked on her wine and placed her cup down in a fit of coughs. Baela and Raena laughed at her frantic movements.   “You what mother?” Daenys questioned. She grabbed a handkerchief and wiped the wine from her chin with slight embarrassment.   Rhaenyra had a playful look on her face “When I was a young girl I had a tour for suitors. One of them was a Blackwood. He had to have been… maybe ten and two at that time. A charming young boy but much too young. Oh whatever was his name… Warren… Wesley…”   “Willem?” Daenys questioned. She had begun to lean forward in her seat.   “Ah yes that was his name. A Bracken lad had insulted him and at that point I just wished to leave. He managed to cut him down despite being half his size.” Rhaenyra plopped a grape into her mouth upon finishing. She told the story as if it was a casual topic of discussion.  “Willem did that? He never mentioned anything about it when I visited Raventree Hall.” Daenys had grabbed the pitcher to fill her cup. “He did mention that he met you once… but nothing about killing a man in front of you.”   In the first month of her courtship with Ben he had taken her to Raventree Hall. Daenys got to see his ancestral home and meet his family. His father Samwell had been a copy of his son. She could tell where he got his shyness and fierce will from. She was grateful to be welcomed so easily into the family even prior to their engagement. Willem and Alysanne Ben’s aunt and uncle were a joy to be around. It took them a few days to get used to the presence of a princess but after the ice was broken Daenys meshed in so well with them.   It was two weeks into her stay that Benjicot had officially asked for her hand in marriage beneath the colossal weirwood tree in the godswood. It was part of a planned dinner they had together a tale of sweetness she wished to keep to herself.   “The Bracken boy asked for it to be so disrespectful in front of a hall of lords and me their princess. A scandal to be sure.” Her mother responded.   “Speaking of Blackwoods” Baela turned to Daenys “How is your Blackwood cousin?”   “I feel there is something else behind your words.” Daenys countered.   “We want to know about him!” Rhaena shifted in her seat with excitement.   Daenys shrugged “You have already met him many times. Why-”   “The details ñuha prūmia” Rhaenyra began “How does he treat you? What drove you to such an engagement other than to benefit my place as heir?”   Daenys paused and thought for a moment. There really was no explanation as to why she gravitated towards him so easily. There was no struggle to know him or awkward first meetings. She had a connection to him and that was all there was to it.   “It’s… more than just knowing someone your whole life. Conversation flows easily with him as if we had always known one another. Perhaps we were acquainted that well in a past life. Truly I cannot explain it. It just feels right as everything is as it’s supposed to be.” Daenys did not believe her words had been poetic as surprisingly that was Ben’s talent not hers. However the gentle awe from the women around her showed that her words were enough.   “He is a gentleman from what I have seen so far” Rhaena added and the other women nodded in agreeance.   “And what is your gentleman up to on the eve of your wedding?” Baela asked.   “Oh Kermit and Oscar Tully arrived just this morn. They are most likely training in the courtyard now nothing too strenuous.” Daenys answered.   ───── ⋆⋅⋅⋆ ─────  “Drink drink drink drink!” The joined chants of Oscar Kermit Jacaerys Lucerys and Daemon carried through the feasting hall of Dragonstone. Ben had a large pitcher of ale clutched in both of his hands. He was currently chugging the drink to the encouragement of the men around him. Some drops of ale spilled from the corner of his mouth and down his chin. Once he finished Ben slammed the drink on the feasting table and raised his arms in victory. All of the men broke into celebratory hollers.   “Nice one laddie!” Oscar Tully patted his friend on the back.   Ben had planned on having a calm night perhaps some training with friends but those plans had been dashed when Daemon decided to host a dinner to celebrate the occasion. Ben could not deny him for he was still unsure of the prince’s thoughts on his and Daenys union. What was a slightly tense dinner had quickly faded the more ale they consumed. The only one who was sober had been Lucerys as he was limited to only a few drinks.   Jacaerys saw his brother try and sneak another glass and quickly snatched the pitcher “I do believe you have reached your limit brother.”   “Just one more Jace.” Lucerys pleaded.   “I don’t think one more drink could do him any harm” Ben defended his soon-to-be brother-in-law.   Daemon nodded after taking a bite of his steak “I agree with Lord Benjicot over there. One more drink won’t harm. Plus it is time Luke begins to learn the ways of men.”   “And the perfect way to do that is with what men know most - ale.” Kermit pitched in.   “See if the wedding were to happen in Kings Landing” Daemon began as he picked up his cup and scanned his gaze across those at the table “I could have shown you all the real way to celebrate. I know all the best brothels.”   The men besides Lucerys laughed. Ben responded “Well Daenys wished for it to be on Dragonstone. Alas my prince I would have had to deny such an invite as I do not frequent such establishments.” Ben waved his hand in polite dismissal. He gazed at the food on his plate and decided he had eaten enough for the evening.   “The honourable Lord Benjicot faithful to his lady.” Jace teased as he put down a pitcher of ale “Tell me which one is the true commander in your union?”   “I do as my princess bids Jace.” Ben chided back at his jest.   “Yes yes I understand your sentiment but such sweet words are boring me.” Daemon poured more wine into his goblet “Let us drink some more.”  ───── ⋆⋅⋅⋆ ─────  “You’ve done an awful lot of teasing about my marriage yet we have not talked about yours” Daenys spoke as they glanced at Baela and Rhaena. Rhaenyra giggled at her daughter’s words and hid her laughter from behind her goblet of wine. The two sisters looked around the room with visible nervousness. The ladies had moved from one of the lounge rooms and into another for dinner. The sun had set long ago and flickering candles illuminated the room. It was a calm night with little wind and gentle waters.  “We are not betrothed” Baela answered.   “But you will be soon” Rhaenyra expressed “And it is important that you keep that in mind.”   Rhaena looked to Daenys “There doesn’t happen to be another available Blackwood?”   “Unfortunately no. You needn’t worry I do not care how many lords I will have to fight you shall marry a man who is kind like you.” Daenys asserted. She had felt similar fear when looking at her prospects for marriage in the past. It is no surprise that it is also felt by Baela and Rhaena. She made a vow to herself to petition for their right to go about and seek a husband rather than all the lords seek them out.   Daenys reflected often on her luck with both happiness and deep sorrow. She was grateful for her situation to be married to a man like Benjicot - more so in her ability to choose. However her heart ached for the other women of the realm; both high and low-born. For the highborn ladies are ferried off like lambs to slaughter. She could not imagine what that was like for those born in the position of lower prospects.   Daenys stifled a yawn which caught her mother’s attention.   Rhaenyra rose from her seat “The hour is late and tomorrow is such a big day. It is well past time we rest.”   There were no complaints from any in the room. They all had been fighting off the coming sense of exhaustion in favour of speaking more. Baela and Rhaena gave both Daenys and Rhaenyra gentle hugs goodbye with quick comments of luck to Daenys for her ceremony on the morrow. Once alone the mother-daughter duo made their way through the dimly lit halls of Dragonstone and to Daenys’ room. Rhaenyra sat on one of the plush chairs in from of a burning hearth. Daenys got on the floor in front of her and waited patiently as her mother took out all of her braids and twists. The feeling of a brush being softly put through her hair nearly lulled her to sleep.   There were no exchanges of words for the entirety of it. Nothing needed to be said. All that was left were two women wishing to be in one another’s company for such a thing would turn into a luxury once Daenys was married and carted off to the Riverlands.   It was an unyielding fear in Daenys that she had not expressed to anyone even Ben. Her time in the Riverlands was the longest she had been apart from her mother. It had only been bearable because she had the presence of her brother and the knowledge that she would return to Dragonstone. With her marriage to Ben she would be tied permanently to Raventree Hall. It was not something she detested. She was excited for her marriage and had made good friends with the Blackwoods but it was still new.   Visits were possible but they would be few and far between. As much as Daenys fought to build her reputation beyond a princess she was deep down still a little girl basking in the light of her mother. A life of barely seeing Rhaenyra would be a life difficult to get used to. Adding to that fear was the prospect of becoming a mother herself. Daenys was not ready to be a mother. How could she if she could barely part from her own?  “I know you care deeply for Benjicot” Rhaenyra began as Daenys moved to sit beside her “but if you have any regret or uncertainty tell me and we can delay the ceremony. I do not want you to feel like it’s too late.”   Daenys looked fondly at her mother “I do wish to marry him truly. I am scared… about how I will be as a wife and most of all being parted from Dragonstone. I don’t wish to lose you mother.”   “Oh ñuha prūmia” Rhaenyra began “You will never lose me.” She reached out and cupped her daughter’s face.   “Things are changing greatly so.”   “That happens in life. We grow up get old and move on from things. Listen you will always be welcome here any moment you can come on Suneater and visit as often as you’d like. I will do the same and visit Raventree Hall whenever possible.” Rhaenyra reassured her daughter.   “You will be busy in a few months taking care of the babe.” Daenys spoke “How is Visenya anyways?” She had been insistent that the babe her mother was carrying would be a girl. Even more so had she been insistent that the child be named Visenya. Rhaenyra was inclined to follow her daughter’s words. Her belly had begun to show a few moons ago so it was only a matter of time until the birth.   “Visenya moves often. It feels the same as all the other pregnancies before. Painful and uncomfortable but worth it.” Rhaenyra answered.   “Well I do not envy you.” Daenys picked at the fabric of her dress.   “Soon you will be in the same position.” Daenys frowned at her mother’s words and continued to distract herself from the topic. Rhaenyra sensed her daughter’s hesitancy and decided it was best not to push any further.   “I think it is best that you get all the rest you can.” The heir got out of her seat with the help of Daenys. As she was being guided out the door she turned back to her child “You will always be my first daughter and my biggest priority.” She kissed Daenys on the head before parting down the hall.   Daenys watched her mother go until she turned down another hallway. Once out of sight she closed the door and proceeded to undress. She got into her nightclothes a thin chemise and crawled into bed. While she was plagued with exhaustion the excitement for the next day exceeded it. She tossed and turned for a while unable to fall asleep. It was after another turn in her bed that she huffed loudly and sat up.   She shuffled out of bed and made her way to one of the windows. Daenys perched on the padded sitting area and watched the night sky. The moon hung in the sky amongst the stars. The shimmering light cast down on the gently moving water surrounding the island. She brought her knees up to her chest and rested her chin on one while wrapping her arms around her legs.   The familiar creaking of the secret door in the far corner of the room pulled Daenys from her thoughts. She turned around to see Ben tumble into her room. When the door opened fully he stumbled and almost lost his balance. Despite the near fall it did not look like he was phased by it.   “My lovely wife!” His voice slightly slurred called out. Daenys had never been more surprised by his actions. She could clearly see his intoxicated state.   “Quiet down Ben. Someone could hear.” She tried to keep her voice down.   Ben paused and stood in the corner for a moment as if he was slowly processing her words. His arms hung at his sides and the clothing her wore was ruffled slightly. His breath was laboured.   “Oh!” He acknowledged but followed it up with hushed laughter “My apologies my lady.” He went to bow but struggled immensely to keep his balance when doing it. He walked shakily over to her and plopped himself down. Ben leaned his back against the vertical part of the window and pulled her into his chest wrapping his arms around her waist. Daenys unravelled and leaned into him while stretching out her legs. Ben had his legs bent at the knees essentially caging her in.   “And pray tell why are you so drunk?” Daenys questioned.   Ben rested his cheek on the top of her head and sighed “Daemon wished to have dinner with me your brothers and my friends. It was amusing.”   “I can tell by the scent of ale on you. Why have you come to my room so late? You should be resting and working off the drinking.” Her words were followed by a whine-like noise escaping his throat.   “But I want my wife.” Ben buried his head in her hair and inhaled the scent.   Daenys trembled from his touch “Tomorrow I shall be your wife.” Ben let out a hum of contentment at her words his lips rumbling against her skin.  “You question why I am up so late yet you happen to be awake.” Ben teased.   “Sleep could not come.” She answered him “I am excited ‘tis all.”   He kissed her neck. Though he was still drunk Ben steeled himself “I know what has been bothering you and it has not been the wedding preparation. I know Raventree Hall may never be considered your home and I am alright with that. I hope you recognize that you will be safe and content under my protection. House Blackwood may not be swimming in gold but we have enough to be well comfortable.”   “It is not that” Daenys said as she grabbed one of his hands and began to play with it “I love your home truly. It will take me a while to adjust but all will be fine. If I am being honest… you are my home Ben.” She leaned back to kiss his cheek.   Ben’s hold on her tightened as his arms wound tighter around her waist “Raventree Hall will always be open to your family for visits. They can stay as long as they wish to.”   “Thank you Ben.” Daenys gaze moved back to the stars in the sky.   “I spoke to your stepfather before coming” Ben spoke after a few moments of silence. Daenys tensed at his words unsure of how their conversation went.   He saw her unease and continued “It was good. Prince Daemon and I spoke privately. He made me take a vow that is all. I do believe we found common ground.”   “What vow?” Daenys inquired.   “That I would protect you with my life. Honour you as my wife. That I pledge fealty to House Targaryen and come to serve in the event of conflict.” Ben swiped his thumb up and down on her stomach rubbing in soothing motions. He lifted his head to rest his chin on the top of her head.   “So you are aware of the tension in my family?”   “The tension is across the seven kingdoms love. Not many lords acknowledge their distaste for your mother as heir but rather hide it. When that comes to the surface…” He trailed off. Daenys felt the tension in his body and she knew he was just as inclined to the state of the kingdom as her.   “That is something to worry about later” Ben told her “For now you must sleep.” Daenys shifted in his hold to get more comfortable. She tilted to the side to get a better vision of the night sky. Ben began to run his hands up and down her arm.   Daenys closed her eyes and allowed herself to be lulled to sleep by Ben’s repetitive movements. It was only after her chest started to rise and fall in calm movements that Ben assessed her to finally be asleep. He maneuvered himself slowly off of the ledge while holding her in his arms. Ben walked across her room and to her bed. He leaned down to pull back the covers while keeping her steady. He placed Daenys into her bed and pulled the covers over her body tucking in the sides tenderly.   The Blackwood man placed a kiss on her forehead “Until tomorrow love.”   ______________  ✧.* note: we are getting closer and closer to the war - super exciting. how long do you think peace during their marriage will last? just something to think on lol.   if you want to be added to any taglist i have you can fill out a response here.  ✧.* taglist: @credulouskhaleesi @username199945 @haydee5010 @yeolsbubbles @f1wh0recom @cococrazy18 @poppyflower-22 @eevanie @dumpmyblues,2024-07-13 15:02:27 GMT

And she wasn’t in her bed.  Recalling the events of that past night- she was in her underclothes not a fortunate sign. Bert wouldn’t have let her go with a stranger.   The woman sat up- rest of the room foggy except the man sat in the chair. He stared right at her “What happened last night?” The Gods merciful as she didn’t seem to have a headache.   She’d not noticed before he stood- but the knight wore no shirt. Safe to say Elspeth was both attracted and flustered. Being strong meant carrying a certain build- Harwin did not disappoint and if made her hate him that much more. “Thank the Seven you’re alive” He held a chalice of water “Drink this.” Mouth dry at him and the previous nights’ frivolities.  She finished the entire cup “What happened last night?” Tone firmer he sat on the foot of the bed. Had he always looked like that?   He was hunched over - elbows to knees - his smile exchanged with a frown. “Who did that to you?” He changed the subject and she didn’t want to give the answer. With that intense stare it wouldn’t take long before she did something she didn’t hold high favour toward.   “I- ” a half spoken lie wouldn’t get her anywhere- not with Harwin. He’d spent so much time with her he knew exactly when she spoke false truths. In the silence she never expected a large hand to reach for hers. And to further bemuse the woman she held onto it. Remembering the strayed tears and how that hand felt stroking through the locks of her red hair. The emotion flooded back in her words “What kind of person harms their own child?” He was there again- just holding her - Elspeth had never felt safer.   Stroking her hair as head cradled on his chest. His heartbeat controlled how she breathed. It was all bliss until she realised that closeness- how her own heart skipped and faltered and his bare skin on hers. Harwin’s face so close that shivers and tickles worked their way over.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; That tether between the tension about to snap.  Then there was a knock at the door. The scramble ensued neither wanted her to leave that position. But the person did not wait before the doors barrelled wide. Revealed the man’s father Ser Lyonel Strong and the scene looked much more diabolical in his eyes “You had better have a good explanation boy!” Those doors slammed shut and her feet hung over his bed. A gentle hand on her back as fur clung around her shoulders.  Her head dipped as a thank you “Speak!” She laughed at her own father giving her a lecture but she deeply respected the master of laws- the girl was ashamed.  Harwin Strong remained completely still throwing on a loose fitted shirt “What do you want me to say?”  “That the eldest daughter of Otto Hightower wasn’t in your bed last night. If the Lord Hand discovers that his bargaining chip of the kingdoms has been defiled-“  “He did no such thing and the ‘bargaining chip’ is right here Ser Lyonel. Your son showed me nothing but kindness and respect. The fault is not his.” The older man studied the pair.  He turned his back to them probably figuring a way out of this bind. “Ser Hightower would have nothing to argue with if I were to ask for your hand” Her messy hair flicked watching the side of his face- meeting the gaze that made her feel fuzzy and molten. That look wasn’t that of a man being forced to marry.   The master of laws held a deep sigh “You were supposed to join the City Watch… become Lord Commander…” And she had wrecked that plan dissolved it because of childish urges.   “Many Gold Cloaks are married!”  “Or we could pretend like this never happened? Harwin did not bed me. Now I would like to put my garments on- it’s rather chilly.” She didn’t want to admit her heart was breaking denying the offer of betrothal. Harwin was the only man that made her feel something- that untameable energy within. He was kind protective… not ugly nor did he have one foot in the grave.  Lyonel vacated the room while his son remained at her request. “Why are you against my proposal?”  She shrugged not that he could see- facing away why did he have to be such a gentlemen? “I’m too young for marriage. The only compelling reason is getting away from my father otherwise I hold no interest.” Only silence lingered until she donned that dress once again. She was never going to hear the end of it from the Lord Hand. Elspeth watched Harwin’s taut expression “What’s got you grief-stricken Strong?”  He struggled to tie his hair back- before she swatted his hands away doing herself. His hair felt almost fluffy “Have you never been in love?” Broad shoulders jerked as he spoke with his hands. What had gotten him so frustrated?  “I could ask you in turn Ser. Have you ever been in love?”  “Yes” A puppy-like infatuation embraced his eyes as she circled back round. Harwin’s hand bracing her jaw and the blue in his eyes invasive. Neither knew which one broke first but they were drawn into a crushing kiss. Elspeth turned with ease- hands wondering down to her waist not dipping lower. He was a gentleman after all.   His fingertips clenched while her body surged up. Dragging him down by the back of his neck. She felt freed like her breaths were her own not controlled by the Hightowers. It’s what kept the fervour raging arm slung around Harwin’s neck. The knight hoisted her up with a breathless ease even when he smiled the kiss didn’t break.   Elspeth was weightless- not a care in the Known World. Hands bracing her waist as she fought the urge to wrap her legs around his. Harwin broke the fever “You’re extraordinary” A reach to bring her face closer. They searched in one another’s souls “But I cannot dishonour you.” Elspeth sank a waver in her steeled eyes. He let go of the woman head still in the clouds.   “When I’m one and twenty” His response was one of bafflement.  He smiled wicked and wide “Forgive me my Lady.”  She battled her own grin - clearing her throat - collecting herself “You can ask me for my hand when I am one and twenty. I promise myself to you.” Love filled his eyes hope bordered. Fingers reaching for hers and she caught them in her hand. “So Ser Breakbones do you accept my proposal?”  Pecking her forehead with a softness “It would be my honour Lady Strong” her heart skipped- maybe stopped altogether. She hid the blush but not well enough from Harwin but he let it slide.  He’d tease her about it later.   She looked up at him with a look he’d never seen before “They’ll have a war party out for me if I don’t show my face. I’ll see you later Ser Strong.”  And with that she was gone walking at such pace to avoid suspicion from her father. But he was bound to have noticed his ‘bargaining chip’ had left her roost.  That’s until she met eyes with her Princess- face red with fury but softened as she saw Elspeth “Rhaenyra what’s the matter?” The Targaryen grasped her hands- something truly was wrong.  “Where have you been?” Mixed with the anger and concern- Elspeth couldn’t pin it to just one.  Elspeth stopped them “No I asked you first. What’s the matter?”   “I’ve been named as heir.”  Brows furrowed voice hushed “What about Daemon?” That’s when she received a glare. “What has he done now?” Normally Rhaenyra was completely onboard with her uncle’s endeavours- her being his partner in crime. But it was a blinded void that dragon fyre roared in her friend.  “He declared to a room of whores and petty thieves… that he was happy my mother and brother died because he would finally be the true heir” She suspected her father had something to do with this report “He called Baelon ‘The Heir for a Day’…” Without a second thought no matter how much it burned her friend- she drew her into a crush. The ‘Elsie Special’ name given by Nyra and Alicent. And it was welcome maybe the younger girl felt as safe as Elspeth had in Harwin’s.  They remained there until Rhaenyra pulled away tears rampant. The pair returned to the Princess’ chambers. “Is this what you want Rhaenyra?”  “It doesn’t matter what I want. My father thinks me a better fit than Daemon” she spat his name.  The coronation was beautiful Rhaenyra would make a fine queen. But it was clear the reluctance of Houses bending the knee to her. Their pride could not handle a woman reigning over them. Rhaenyra Targaryen would be their Queen and they would have to get used to the new reality.  But all the while she stood beside the master in laws and his two sons. Hand holding in secrecy with the eldest.   What was the future to hold? Harwin Strong would definitely become its centre point.  Six months passed and the woman couldn’t stop bumping into the man. Sharing a kisses where prying eyes weren’t welcome. Rhaenyra commented that during gatherings whether Harwin and Elspeth were parted or close the tension was palpable. Maybe Otto Hightower would pick up on that and arrange a meeting for her betrothal to him- get rid of her.   A woman could hope and pray to The Seven. Neither meant any divine intervention would take place.  Her own tensions weren’t the only running rife. Beyond the Seven Kingdoms- the Stepstones it had been a concern for years. Pirates had always taken refuge there quite infamous for their troves in the many cave systems. “May I speak freely?”  Rhaenyra’s head peered up with a smile “When don’t you speak freely Elsie. Go ahead.”  “Why hasn’t your father intervened in the Stepstones? Surely it could be quickly resolved with dragons…”   “Are you sure we’re not the same person?” Her quizzical and whimsical look had Elspeth in stitches. Rhaenyra going back to her studies- apparently unable to focus - before facing her friend again “I was relieved of my duty as cupbearer for posing the same question. Lord Corlys appeared on board with the idea”  Elspeth nodded “Dutifully so they are his ships being plundered.”  “Yes and then your father had me removed to select the newest Kingsguard. It may have been more amusing than filling cups- but if I am to be heir to the Seven Kingdoms I must know what happens in them.” The nib of her quill broke ink spilling across the page. Elspeth gathered a handkerchief to contain the spillage. “Thank you. If I am not trained for my duties as Queen I will look a fool but supposedly if my father trains me it makes him look stupid. Do you understand what I’m saying or are these Council meetings driving me insane?”  Elspeth grabbed her hands from across the table “You lacked sanity when I met you. And what it sounds like you’re trying to say is ‘why did the King name your heir if he weren’t to mould you into a rightful one’?”   “When I rule you will be my Lady Hand” She stood in a frivolous display “All rise the Hand of the Queen- Lady Elsie Strong!” Elspeth dumbfounded.  “Maybe you have gone crazy Princess. I am a Hightower not a Strong”  “But you will be a Strong when I am Queen. You’ll probably have quite handsome little Strongs running around as well” Elspeth attempted to appear dumb “You’re not fooling anyone. I’d have to be blind to ignore the way that man has been looking at you. And the way you look at him… when’s the wedding?”  “Is anybody really ready to be wed? Twelve is too young as is nineteen.”  Rhaenyra quirked her face. “When I am forced to marry I won’t be as fortunate as you to have a man look at me like Ser Harwin does you!” She didn’t shout. She had never shouted at Elspeth Hightower and never would.  “I promised myself to him. When I am one-and-twenty we will marry Alicent nor my father know. I haven’t figure that part out yet.” She twiddled her thumbs fidgeting to relieve the embarrassment   Rhaenyra giggled “This is so exciting! Have you done anything? Y&#x27;know… in his bed chambers…”  Elspeth gasped- mainly in faux “Princess you shouldn’t know of such things!” Before she giggled being tackled on her seat by the blonde. “And we’ve only kissed. It is unbecoming and unladylike to do anything further before marriage.”  “Well it must be good if people want to do it out of wedlock” She shrugged while Elspeth shook her head.  The eldest changed the subject “So who did you choose as the new Kingsguard?”  A smirk spread upon the Princess’ fair features- Elspeth knew that face “Ser Criston Cole.”  “A fine choice”  A scoff from the heir to the throne “You didn’t even see him unhorse my uncle. Actually where were you?” A knowing look. “You can’t stay away from him. You love him” A playful shove and singsong tone. And it was true- about her not being able to remain distant. She wasn’t sure if she loved Ser Harwin Strong. She cared for him and that grew everyday but it wasn’t love.   Not quite yet.￼  She left Rhaenyra - who had been called into a Council meeting.   “Practicing without your shirt is not a requirement Ser” That nakedness that smirk. She was weak at her knees but held herself. More than once in a week was too much.   He put down the sword grabbing a canteen of water. Approaching the fair maiden- practically his betrothed “My Lady you’re staring.” Water over his face- running down his hair and his body. Elspeth used every ounce of self control she possessed.   Though her tongue proved to be less malleable “I definitely prefer it over speaking to the Lord Hand.”  “I think everyone would.”  “Well aren’t you the picture of modesty?” They’d both taken steps forward. All the woman wanted to do was feel his lips on hers down her neck. All over. Harwin’s eyes spoke the same intentions. “Stop looking at me like that.”  “I cannot promise that my Lady” He inched even more- his breath caressed her skin.  Her own caught in her words “And why’s that?”  “Because I keep falling for you.” She wanted to tell him how cheesy it was. How she was unaffected. How she wholeheartedly never wanted him to kook at her again. But she’d be a liar.  They weren’t naive nor fickle minded. Chin lifted and she was all his moaning before she was on his lips again.,2024-07-13 16:42:11 GMT

Foul language. Thinking you are tripping balls. Lord of light is coming.  Music to listen to: A day to remember: 2nd sux  Summary: Training begins for Benijot Blackwood and even for you. There is no mercy given to both of you for the dire betrayl you caused both the Brackens and the Starks. Rumors spread like wild fire of where you two must of gone. But both of you are in the safest place you can think of. In a place not even Satan dare not enter. Even Satan’s face could be sliced off and used.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; “Morning” you awoke almost choking from the cold water thrown on your face.  The waif was looking at you with deep loathing. You wanted to punch her until all her teeth were knocked off.  “I believe you had enough rest you are not here to drag your feet around. Get up!”  “Here are the clothes we use here. Get dressed quickly. You are no longer any sort of lady of title within these walls.”  Be quick and follow me. After dressing. The waif guided you into a maze of cold stone with dimly lit corridors. With faces lining the arches of those corridors. Mouths gaping torn holes where eyes should of been. Yet the faces seemed moist and freskly carved. You were taken to a large room which would be an exaggerating thought really. As Benji stated a room full of pillars with human faces. Pillars skyrocketing towards the ceiling. You could see hundreds upon hundreds of candles lit around not just the pillars but around statues of death and the old gods.   In the much far distance you could see women children elders surrounding a large basin on the floor filled with water. Their faces illuminated by candle light filled with grief relief peace and surrender.     “If you don’t want to end up like them pay close attention or you’ll never leave this place. At least with breath still in your lungs.”  “How old are these faces” You asked  “Some since within the past ages.even before we were not a lustful thought in our mother’s minds.” Stated the waif.  You met up with jacken and the familiar face that brought warmth and hope in your heart. As well Benji was wearing the same tunics as you. A plain navy blue tunic with sandals.  “I believe in wasting no time and we begin now.”  Pacing away from the pillars of never ending masks of flesh the anxious feeling would not leave your stomach.  Once again tho to your sour thoughts. Benji disappeared with jacken.  “Did you think this was a couples travel? You need to stand on your own and no longer rely on him. Or you will die quickly. From now only you belong to the many face God. He is your partner the reason why you even breath.”  The waif threw a spear at you and swung hard towards you. The move was so swift you didn’t see your side begin to drip with blood. Looking down you seen this girl was in no way planning to actually help you but to kill you.  “There is only one god and his name is Death. And there is only one thing we say to Death: ‘Not today’.”  The waif moved without warning and spun around. Once more slashing your ankle. More blood.  Swing after swing she never missed until your body was sweating blood more than actual sweat.  “Observe the movements and slow them down in your mind. It’s the only way you’ll learn to block me; from carving you like the rotted cheese you are.”  From day after day you got your ass kicked by the waif. Coming back to your chambers with blooming bruises and fresh wounds. &#x27;Slow your movements down in the mind’ you said to yourself.  On the other side of the spectrum Benjicot was also fighting to getting to the point to breath normally. Yes he was great in war. But jacken was no mere human. And he gave no sympathy. Blood poured down his forehead. Clouded vision from the blood clots blocking his sight.  It felt like jacken was eight different men in one. With different fighting styles. A cut throat swords man from Kings Landing:   Swinging his sword with the thirst of a rabid wolf. Catching his forehead. Which exploded into blood running down his face.   a swift water dancing spear master from Braavos:   Moving so swiftly with such grace and knocking Benjis sword off his hands in the blink of an eye. The initials S.F. written in blood on Benjis left forearm. Blood trickled down his fingers. The lines repeated   “There’s only one God and his name is death and what do we say to the god of death dear benij?” A man with a white blouse and brown toursers and boots to his knees whispered.   “NOT TODAY!!!!” Benji screamed.     A Darth Raki solider :  Screaming the battle cry for blood lust and a sense of rape in his eyes. Tanned and covered in blue war paint. Grabbing Benji and slamming him on the ground with one pull. Trying to tear off his tunic for a better access to rape. Benji was pinned on the ground blood and saliva mixing on the cold stone. Benji had one chance. He swerved and sliced the Darthriki in the eye. Crawling away to stand up all Benji could do was sway. With nothing to hold onto.   A trained unsuli:  In the stance of a true soldier afraid of nothing. Death was an honor no balls but more balls than most men. A spear can at benjis face. Striking his cheek in a heavy blow.     The myths of the white walker king:  The air became very cold. Benji could see his breath. All around him everything turned to ice. His lungs ached every breath he took. This was the feeling of death. A blue monster with blue eyes gleaming picked Benji up once more and started choking the life out of him. The cold air felt like it was going to melt his face.     But the three most unexpect were his brother Davos his own father Samwell….and Benji himself.  “You must learn to trust in no one not even yourself. For a boy thinks he knows his character but that can change in a second. Depending on mercy. Here you shall lose mercy. For strangers loved ones and yourself. Your greatest fear and Opponent is you.”  Jacken once more changed his exterior to one of an old man with no eyes. His hair completely gone in the most poorest of frocks. You seen he had no shoes and his toe nails were missing. The smell of rotting flesh was unbearable. Benji vomited to the side.  The old man spoke “You are still showing weakness. A boy must be nonchalant to any condition.”  As his last sentence came to an end. The old rotted corpse flung himself at Benji. Dripping in worms that landing in benjis hair and hands. The old man’s blood so rotted he just admitted green pus. Dagger in his hand he aimed for benjis throat.  Benji swayed to the right avoiding his demise.  “Good but not good enough.” Jacken cackled. his father appeared. Benjis eyes grew wider. Merciless benji said under his breath. His father was burning holes into benjis eyes.  “My dear boy you must learn to die before you can breath again.” His father said softly.  Pulling out a family sword from his sheath Benji recognized all too well. He took the same exact swings and turns as his father had taught him as an actual child. But no longer as a lesson but as threat of death.  “You are no son of mine until you can slay me. Your father the father that gave you the admittance to even breath!!&quot; Yelled the plain murderous look of the illusion of his father.  Benjis father faded…what came next was even more heart wrecking.  Davos his beloved twin brother slaughtered at the battle at the mill by a fucking Bracken. Face and body soaked in blood. Holes in almost ever inch of his tunic. Blood sliding into the stone floors forming a pool.  &quot;Dear brother we shared a womb I kicked your pathetic ass then and I’ll do it again!”  Swinging with a force of a kissed by fire wilding. This force was too powerful but Benji had to keep his ground. He was losing footing with the rage of his past twin. Benji managed to kick Davos in the face. Dodging his brother moves more precisely.  “Getting better you dumb cunt.” Davos grinned and disappeared.  Standing infront of you was you….  Blinking your eyes to not be driven into madness. The 2nd you began to grin.  “Look at you fighting and thinking you can change your stars. For a girl that’s just like any other common whore from a brothel. Ruining your future ruling of your house. For what? A common whore?!”  “Benji” You said softly in shocked wide eyes. Jacken lunged towards you with a familiar dagger made out of valerian steel.  Benji ran towards you in such a speed it scared him. Benji flung you into a pillar. You bounced off hard onto the stone floor. A dagger was pieced through the very pillar you just should by. This really was no game. Neither the waif nor jacken wanted to help you.  Jacken shifted into your brother Areon.  “Sister where have you gone what have you done to us to father to Cregan. All for this reckless. Worthless craven fuck.”  Your eyes grew wide and shiny as if they were made out of glass. You couldn’t believe what you were seeing.  Before anymore thoughts arose the illusion of Aeron paced towards you dagger in hand.  Benji ran towards you only to be slammed into a wall by the waif.  Still covered in blood you stood up a dagger in your own hands and swung.  “You are not my brother!!!&quot; You screamed.  The masks one the walls and the pillars made a loud sound of screaming in unison as they glowed in a shade of crimson. The most horrible noise you and Benji ever heard.   You and Benji both felt your ears dripping. Blood flowing from the sides of your necks.   The dim light from the torches burst into raging fires.  Jacken turned back into Benji.  &quot;How much would you say you love me? Would you die with me? Would you die for me? Your just a stupid little girl who thinks a prince would come to save you. But your very fairly mistaken. Remember when I told you I did things bc I was bored? Well you are one of them. My little escape from boredom. Your body your voice your face. My escape until I find another object to extinguish my lack of faith in having a dancing monkey. Your body replaceable your memory replaceable your very essence of existence! All replaceable! This is real life you dumb cunt! No one matters no one cares! Only you you poor bitch.”  “Idk what this is but you are not Benji.&quot; You said sternly.  &quot;Noooooooo!!!!!!” Benji screamed.  Benji screamed in slow motion. The waif had gone behind you and speared your heart. Falling to your knees eyes filled with tears you collapsed on your side.  “You must die before you can live.” The last thing you heard from jacken. His voice trailing softly away as you closed your eyes and heard bejis voice one last time screaming your name in agony. Before everything went dark.  “To retrieve her back you now must earn the right to see her breathe again.” Jacken looked at you with blank eyes.  “The lord of light will be on their way. Tonight you shall not rest until you prove your worthy of the heinous wars to come.”,2024-07-13 17:09:36 GMT

I’ve been thinking about this for forever and idk this might be stupid cause i’ve never read the books or fully seen GOT but-  Why are basically all of (in this case) Alicents children blonde? Like it makes sense for Rhaenyra to be blonde cause both her parents were and it makes sense that her children have brown hair because ser harwin has brown hair and brown is dominant over blonde.   BUT RED IS RECESSIVE OVER BLONDE!! And i think (?) Alicent had red hair so it would make sense if at least TWO of her kids had red or brown hair (if it’s brown and i’m just colorblind). Red is dominant over blonde and it’s always basically a 50/50 in genetics so to me having (supposedly) four children with silvery blonde hair and blue/purple eyes is absolutely INSANE.  Or maybe not and i’m just stupid.,2024-07-13 18:31:58 GMT

He cannot keep his eyes off her anymore and seemingly neither can she.   Warnings: drinking/alcohol consumption (drunken words are sober thoughts hint hint)  Author’s Note: I’ll keep this short but tysm for the love and reblogs ❤️❤️ also thank you @thebenjiblackwoodexpress for the sweet comment i appreciate it so much 🥹🥹♥️ anyways here’s part two!! enjoy!  Word Count: 5.7k  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Aeron’s smile had not left him on his journey back to camp. He had a giddiness in his step nearly skipping as he relayed his and Bellena’s conversation over and over in his mind.   She was witty welcoming empathetic; all the traits he’d hoped she would be. He wanted to know more greedy in his need to get closer to her and selfish as well as his gut reminded him that he could never have her not fully. However he had done himself proud by finally taking some initiative the pride of it cutting through all his doubts keeping his mind afloat and away from the truth. He could almost laugh at himself at his accomplishments satisfaction filling him as he passed the drunken men who now roamed the lawn. A few bumped into him some even accosting him unfairly as he had almost caused a collision once or twice his beam gazing on the grass as he walked. He was approaching his tent cheeks burning from his permanent grin not noticing the glow from the lamplight coming from within. His thoughts were wrapped around Bellena’s smirk. It had reminded him briefly of Ben’s; similar in nature but not filled with the malice it seemed to bring out in his rival. Bellena’s was full of challenge like her brother’s still but hers held a twinkle in her gaze as she presented it light hearted in her manner. She jested with it a lure bringing forth his true personality as she’d wanted to see it. He admired her courage; most of the conversation himself struck silent by her presence; her ultimately leading and tending to it. She’d seemed to want to and perhaps even liked speaking with him egging him on until she’d almost departed and his own courage had rebounded. He was happy it had so grateful he’d finally done it; spoken with her. His bottom lip drew back and his grin widened teeth exposing themselves as he smiled to himself.  Aeron finally reached the Bracken camp hand extending for the flap of his tent carelessly pulling it back as light poured out effectively ignoring the idea that someone had beaten him home.   That someone who had evidently beaten him to camp was sat upright on Aeron’s cot. Lord Amos’ arms and legs were crossed as he waited but the latter unfolded as he looked towards Aeron with a risen brow and almost a grin as his nephew stepped inside. Aeron halted the flap fluttering closed behind him as he froze on the spot. His smile had dropped but not before his uncle spotted it jumping from his seat in response to Aeron’s arrival. Arms still crossed he strolled to Aeron leaning down towards his nephew’s burning face.   “Taking an early leave to bed I see.” Aeron could only stare back eyes widening at his uncle’s words as his heart pounded in his chest. Gods he knew. Perhaps he’d followed his nephew or finally made his own conclusion at Aeron’s unwavering gape that he held upon the Blackwoods all night. Fear trickled down his spine. Aeron though not excited for the consequences thought only of Bellena. He didn’t want her to get into trouble not for his actions his ill-rationed decisions.   He was about to go to his knees to start begging his uncle not to tell Lord Blackwood to save Bellena before she was thrown under the carriage.   His uncle clapped his shoulder though squeezing it tightly bringing Aeron back from his thoughts and startling him. Lord Amos looked excited strangely enough.   “You’ve met a woman haven’t you?” The guilt plagued Aeron’s gut the Bracken heir unable to lie further. It took a moment for him to nod sullen about his actions but also confused at his uncle’s phrasing. Lord Amos would’ve surely mentioned Bellena by name condemning them both but instead he labels her as ‘woman’ instead. He also would’ve most like accosted his nephew but Lord Amos was not even yelling or even angry. The realization dawned on Aeron. He didn’t know. His uncle though completely right in his line of thinking had not come to the conclusion it was Bellena but instead another Riverlands girl. Aeron could almost feel himself relax if he was not already so high strung emotional responses appearing rapidly to match whatever nerve was struck within him. His uncle continued shaking him bringing him away from his thoughts once more. “So? Did you kiss her bed her make her weep? Tell me all Aeron.”   The Bracken heir could barely move his legs let alone speak but he did so anyway. The courage he’d lost on the worry of being found out had rebounded somewhat despite being so frazzled and brought the words to his lips.   “We spoke for a good while actually.”   His uncle’s hand dropped from his shoulder and he blinked rapidly for a moment the grin faltering slightly as he furrowed his brow.  “You you spoke?” Lord Amos’ head tilted slightly trying to comprehend. “You only spoke?” Aeron nodded the pride in his belly rising as he thought of the conversation bringing himself back from his state of befuddlement. He could feel his grin return as he remembered her hand in his the ghost of it still prickling his grip. He flexed his fingers unconsciously. His uncle was still quirking his head as he watched Aeron’s face beam struggling to find his next words.  “That’s- that’s a fine job. Well done Aeron.” The Bracken heir finally relaxed breathing out a sigh and nodding his head. He was relieved he could admit to what he’d done though he avoided the specifics.   “Thank you Uncle.” For a moment they both stood there Aeron positively lighting the room while his uncle peered at him a curious but confused look in his gaze. Lord Amos broke from his own thoughts gesturing to the cot he’d just occupied.   “Well off to bed now.” Aeron quickly nodded again taking the few paces to the cot and sitting atop the makeshift feather mattress. He began undressing first his boots before reaching for the pins that held his cape not even bothering to call for Alfred encased in his happiness. Aeron drunk in his own merry glee did not notice his uncle’s eyes linger on him narrowed but not suspicious; mostly just surprised at Aeron’s pious even childlike behavior. Especially with a woman. Lord Amos watched him a moment more before departing the tent for his own.   ——  The next morning the sun was high cascading down its warmth as the humidity began to rise. Aeron sat in his tent eating the breakfast Alfred had just served him; a plate of salted pork hard cheese with fruit and a chunk of bread. He was still in his tunic and small clothes barely awake a result of his racing mind that kept him up most the night. He’d gone through the conversation at the weirwood several times altering parts to one’s he’d wished he’d done such as kissing her. He still needed permission for that so he mostly held back though he imagined the sensation all the same. He envisioned himself confessing to her his longing sometimes on one knee and other times while still holding the hand she placed in his. He pictured her various possible reactions lingering on the ones filled with adoration smiles and acknowledgement of her own yearning too. He tried to ignore the others where she’d slap him kick him or call upon her brother who always seemed to miraculously appear from behind a shrub armed and ready to fight Aeron. These latter thoughts were impulsive but he did his best to brush them off. He had all but revealed his true intentions with his look; his gawking of her. And she still had not turned him away. It made him hopeful anticipating over the next time they’d meet. If they’d meet. He could still gaze upon her though at least for the upcoming week for which he was thankful. He hoped she would look back at him now now that she’d acknowledged him and called him by name.   A smile grazed his lips as he thought of it nibbling at his meal.  Today was the first day of the melee. There were estimated to be twenty competitors each day five total rounds to spread the celebrations and provide entertainment to even the latecomers. On the last day there would be the final showdown containing the victors of the week. Aeron has been practicing for months spending hours a day on the sword readying himself for his introduction to the world of tournaments. He thought himself much improved and so did Lord Amos though Aeron still could not defeat Stone Hedge’s master-at-arms.   He was not fighting today but instead on the morrow. He hoped to gauge the men exchanging blows today studying them and practicing once more in the evening. Though he knew he should be nervous he wasn’t. He was not the best knight in the Seven Kingdoms nor was ever like to be but he still wanted to try. He dreamed of his name being pronounced as victor of the melee to be a part of something that people would remember throughout the Riverlands. Aeron knew his dreams were far-fetched so he mostly just hoped it would be memorable something to recall in the years to come at Stone Hedge.  Aeron had Alfred dress him after breaking his fast his previous days attire still clean as it draped his body once more. He’d smelled the clothes not only to check for his own odor but to see if whatever Bellena had worn the night before had lingered on him as well. He couldn’t place it then her so close to him and his mind not particularly focused on her perfume at that given moment for obvious reasons. He did smell a trace of it upon his clothes but not enough to coat his own scent. Aeron frowned upset almost but he thought perhaps it’d stick to him in their next meeting if that would even happen. He hoped it would.   “All finished Ser.” Alfred tightened the last strap on Aeron’s shoulder before stepping back to examine his handiwork. Aeron stood peering at himself in the looking glass before voicing his thanks to his squire with a smile.   “It looks good Alfred well done.” Alfred returned the smile with a nod and a grin of his own before returning to clean up the last of Aeron’s breakfast. The Bracken heir took the opportunity to step outside the tent mostly to see where the sun lay in the sky now the melee beginning at noon. It did lay close to that time so Aeron called out for Alfred to abandon his tidying; it could wait. It was Alfred’s first time seeing a tournament and Aeron had promised he could join him and his party in the stands. Alfred exited the tent quickly and Aeron gestured with a nod towards Riverrun. The two began their trek joining other houses and the masses as they congregated to the castle grounds.   ——  The stands were crowded the same spectators of last melee present with a few new faces added to the mix. Lord Amos had already secured seats for all his men arriving early to do so but also to engage with the Lords and Ladies of the Riverlands a tradition of the tournament. It allowed for them to speak face to face of their bereavements or conflicts and sometimes even their resolutions. Aeron knew it was his uncle’s favorite part of the gathering a guarantee he could confront Lord Samwell Blackwood without crossing the border his rival since childhood. Lord Amos received the same treatment from his foe though it did not deter him but instead fueled the fire keeping their competition alive. Aeron understood but also found it humorous most of his life until he met Ben Blackwood. A pompous ass the Blackwood had hated Aeron from the moment he’d set eyes on him so Aeron’d returned it. It was easy if he was to be honest Ben being the type of person you could only either hate or loathe. He thanked the Seven that Bellena was nothing like her brother or so she seemed. He believed it however especially after their encounter the night prior; her manner too kind to even assume the Blackwood heir her kin. He spotted the Raventree party across the field in the opposite stands as he sat in his own seat. Bellena was between her father and brother wearing a bronze dress with wide full sleeves the neckline cut short at her collarbone. Aeron was stunned taken with her beauty. His breath completely left him as she turned to speak with Ben revealing the low cut on her back the fabric dipping down below her shoulder blades. Gods save him now. Aeron was handed a cup of ale or wine he didn’t notice as he drank his form twisting back into the one of study the evening before. His eyes trailed over the rim as he gazed at her before taking another gulp.   He almost choked as her eyes turned back across the way landing directly on him. The alcohol dribbled down his chin before he swiped it away and he could see her stifle a laugh. He unconsciously lifted a hand forgetting the men by her side and his but luckily she did not glancing towards her family before deciding it was safe. She raised a few fingers from the hands clasped upon her lap waving them slightly.   His heart soared belly flip-flopping as they maintained their exchange of looks before she gestured to the field acknowledging the melee about to begin with a lifted brow. He felt himself nod back softly but rapidly gesturing to the field in a way of saying he was excited as well for today’s fight. She nodded back smiling shyly as she drew her gaze away. He could see her eyes glance his way in her peripheral however widening the grin on his face. His attention was drawn away by his uncle behind him the Lord Bracken yelling out into the crowd a little drunk despite how early in the day it was.   “Start the melee already!” A few exclamations rose with his uncle’s also encouraging the start of the games. Aeron and all others seemed to turn to see Oscar Tully’s reaction in the host’s section of the stands. Riverrun’s young heir was nervously gripping his hands looking towards his Lady grandmother seated beside him. As she’d done the night before she nodded the same smile emboldening Oscar to make the announcement. The young heir raised his hand in the air and all went still waiting for his response. His young pitch cleared the silence as his hand fell back down beside him.   “Bring the men!” Cheering erupted amongst the stands feet stomping the wood that held them up Aeron included in the rabble.   The fighters were brought out twenty total as estimated lining up in front of the young Tully and presenting themselves. Their titles were announced now as well by the Steward of Riverrun though Aeron could not remember his name.   A few Frey men were on the field along with some men who fought for the Darry and Lychester amongst others. Some knights from the neighboring Westerlands were present as well; the Estren Marband and Lefford coats of arms plain upon their persons. Some held shields and others did not Aeron deciding himself for the latter for his own engagement on the morrow. Shields were beyond helpful blocking blows and providing coverage but the men were all armored and the lists each day were small compared to that of the other kingdoms so he didn’t fret. The Rivermen rarely killed another at this gathering the last being the year Aeron was born. There were of course broken limbs crushed fingers and concussions but nothing lethal. This tournament was only a bit of fun during the hot summer season after all.   After the competitors were named Oscar stood up and gave his approval signaling the men with a gesture to begin. A horn sounded and the fighting began. Aeron cheered and booed as young and old yielded as the hour passed but his line of sight always returned to Bellena. He watched her laugh gasp exclaim out with each hit or dodge. She grabbed her brother’s hand at one point when a man on the field broke an arm from the squirmish. Ben patted her gently however his laugh was loud seeing the knight scream. Aeron could feel the envy in his chest him wanting to hold her hand as she was frightened. He would do it right though not with a bawdy laugh in her ear but with soothing words and comforts.   Aeron hadn’t realized it’d come down to two until the crowd grew louder and many started to stand shouting words of advice the fighters could not hear. A man of Marband and one of the Frey sons were the last upon the ground going at each other violently both their previous shields discarded. The Westerman had the upper hand for most of the fight wearing the other down slowly and surely. It was close the blade of Marband clashing with the Frey’s before finally bearing down on it pushing the Frey man’s own steel closer and closer to its owner. Suddenly with great strength the Frey pushed back using the small height advantage he had over his opponent. The Marband knight was thrown back but was quick to rebound his sword raising. The Frey was quicker though. His steel was at his competitor’s neck instantly pointing its tip under the jaw of the Westerman brushing his armor and threatening to push it through. As it was rare to kill the crowd immediately saw it as victory the first of the events. The audience was full of cheers and joyous screams even the Lady Tully clapping happily for her kin. Aeron’s eyes drifted back across the way to Bellena who was clapping as well smiling with her teeth as she exchanged comments with her father. Ben was grabbing the shoulders of the men of his house excitedly before being handed a bag of coin from one particularly disappointed man. Of course the Blackwood heir had bet on the melee; Aeron shouldn’t have suspected anything less.   Bellena’s gaze turned back across the field meeting his once more. She raised her eyebrows gesturing with her head at the win still clapping. Her grin pulled her lips in slightly as she beamed at him. Aeron mimicked her smile his own bottom lip turning in. He raised his cup towards her and she quirked her head in response before leaning over to grab her own cup from beside her feet. Her exposed back briefed his line of sight for a moment the bronze of her dress glinting as she moved. His breath caught looking at her bare skin but he gulped his nerves away as she uprighted herself. She brought the drink to her lips her eyes glazing over the rim towards him. Aeron’s heart started to beat wildly as she gave him an alluring smile gesturing her cup just slightly before taking a sip. He automatically nodded staring at her lips wondering the taste of them with wine upon her mouth. He licked his own lips unconsciously willing his gaze back to hers. A smirk had breached her face now as she looked away cheeks reddening clearly even from a distance.   The crowd began rising tearing Aeron’s attention away. The celebrations were to continue with another feast and most were ready to start as people went to depart for the hall. He rose as well with his party listening to Alfred as they began to descend and join the rest.   “And BAM! The Westerman didn’t even see it coming!” Aeron laughed happy for his friend’s enthusiasm.   “I told you it would be all I said and more.” Alfred nodded mind still on the last fight.   “It was Ser. Thank you for letting me attend.” Aeron shrugged brushing away his thanks.  “There’s no need to thank me Alfred. Every riverman deserves to see the melee at least once. Perhaps you could even join the rabble sometime in the future.” Alfred’s eyes widened looking towards his principal.   “I could never Ser. I’ve seen you with a blade and that is more than enough for me to know I would be the first to yield.” Aeron laughed again taking the compliment.   “Well I’m happy to impress but many men are even better than I.” Alfred nodded vehemently.   “Exactly Ser. I don’t intend on meeting any of them either.” Aeron laughed once more clapping his squire’s shoulder and rolling his eyes with gusto.   “Let’s join the others.”   ——  The feast was spirited the actual spirits helping the shared enjoyment. Aeron was a little drunk he would admit. His eyes were hooded his belly full contented with the day. The only thing drawing him short was Bellena who’s house had sat farther away this night making it hard to see her as she had her back towards him as well. Not that it stopped him from gawking once more her revealed skin visible to him even from the distance. Her pale skin flexed all night shoulder blades moving as she ate and drank with her peers seemingly enjoying herself. He was satisfied as long as she was even if he couldn’t see her face. The night was growing long and many had departed already for their camps but the rival houses remained amongst the few still lively. When Bellena rose again as she had the night before he couldn’t stop himself from rising as well the wine nullifying his insecurity of being caught. Alfred pulled him back down though unknowingly of course of the true reason of his standing shoving another filled cup in front of Aeron. Aeron didn’t even think as his hand rounded the crystal bringing it to his lips and gulping it down. His eyes went back to Bellena who had already given her family her farewells and was now heading towards the exit. She stopped this time though just before she departed. He could see her turn her gaze to his her lids hooded as well and face red from the drink. She tilted her head to the hall casually as if stretching her neck. If it wasn’t for her enticing look and smirk he would’ve thought it meaningless but her suggestive raised brow was all he needed to know what she requested. She wanted him to follow after her. He jumped up again and her smirk widened before she turned and headed off hair swaying. Aeron swayed as well almost needing to grab the table but he straightened brushing the meal’s crumbs away from his lap. He didn’t even need to say anything his uncle raising a hand up already.   “Go sleep the wine off Aeron you can barely stand as is. We’ll join you shortly.” Aeron didn’t look his uncle’s way as he nodded eyes still on the place Bellena had just occupied. He sauntered off after her smashing his thigh into the edge of the table on his way out causing his party to laugh.   Down the passage and past the gardens he went no longer stumbling when he entered the Godswood. She was standing in front of the weirwood again her head tilted looking at it. He came to stand next to her his face hot from the drink as he looked upon the ancient tree as well. She began the conversation this time.  “I would say that was more enjoyable than the last opening melee. But I suppose I wasn’t paying too much attention to it to know for sure.” Aeron couldn’t stop the smile from appearing on his face as she teased him. He answered swiftly not caring for words or his beating heart the wine relaxing his manner completely.   “Your dress was too bright to gaze upon much else. A glimmering jewel amongst the muck.” She turned to him a faux sheepish smile on her lips.   “I’m sorry to have distracted my Lord you must forgive my choice of attire.” He laughed unable to hide his humor eyes still on the weirwood. The drink turned his mind though causing him to become somewhat serious with his next words.   “You looked stunning. I couldn’t tear my eyes away.” He shook his head before continuing afraid he’d said too much. “Apologies my Lady that was brash.” He felt a hand touch his upper arm tracing fingers down to his elbow. He turned to see Bellena looking up at him examining his face. If his blood didn’t already pulse in his ears he was sure it was doing so now. Her pursed lips hid her approving smile but not well.  “There’s no need I enjoy the attention.” Their gaze lingered on each other her brown eyes piercing into his hazel. His heart seized for a moment her touch still upon him. He couldn’t stop himself in his drunken stupor from asking his next question the pivotal question everyone wanted to know the answer to especially himself. His voice was not judgmental but curious.  “How has no man laid claim to you yet?” It was the wrong question the wrong thing to say the wrong phrasing. He watched her face fall his gut doing the same and he felt mortified. Why had he said that? She pulled away her hand leaving his arm. All he wanted to do was grab it as he did the night before and place it back upon his person. He was such a fool backpedaling all their progress all his work. She crossed her arms still remaining beside him no longer meeting his eye. He tried to bail out his words explain his comment.   “Bellena I didn’t mean it like that-“ She cut off his words hers a little sharp like she’d heard the question before.   “It is not by my own reproach I assure you.” He could feel his brow raise as he looked at her. She continued huffing and looking to the ground. “My brother he insists upon dueling my suitors and well you can gather what happens afterwards.” Aeron felt his eyes widen the alcohol making his next assumption.   “He slays them?” She turned her face back up to him brow furrowed her smile returned and slightly comical.   “No he only frightens them away. He is not as cruel as you think.” Aeron scoffed unable to hold his tongue. He nodded sarcastically as he responded.   “Oh yes Ben Blackwood my apologies. I thought we spoke of another man.” Her laughter was soft as it cut through the air surprising him. His heart soared hearing it knowing it was his doing. He pressed on trying to keep her going. “He once chased me away as well but I was too quick.” She shook her head her chuckle moving to her chest shaking it. He couldn’t help but glance down but he pulled his eyes away swiftly minding his manners. She played to his humor encouraging him and boosting his pride.  “Ah I see. I remember now he came home so upset over his failed hunt. I had to soothe him as if he was a child again.” He smirked at her eyes almost closing as he watched her. His mind turned over again recalling her words. His tone was gentle as he spoke.   “I’m sorry he does that. You do not deserve it.” She smiled though it was weak. Her touch came to his elbow again staying there.   “He is my brother I cannot blame him. He doesn’t wish me to go.” Aeron nodded in agreement. He wished the same though he also thought of his cousin as well one he did not wish to part with either one that was also beginning to receive proposals.   “That’s understandable.” She nodded as well her brown eyes searching his but he wasn’t sure what for. A calm silence fell upon them as they pondered each other. The words he’d wanted to say for ages slipped from him before he could think not that he was actually thinking at any point in their conversation the wine leading him most of the way.  “Any man would be lucky to have you whether they could defeat your brother or not.” He could feel his eyes widen again realizing what he’d just said. His heart pounded waiting for her response if she’d even grace him with one after that slip. Her gaze darkened some but not with cruelty though it made him freeze not able to tear his own away from her. She was like a siren there under the moon pulling him to the rocks with only her eyes as consolation. Her voice lured him further barely above a whisper.   “Any man? Or just yourself?” He was shaking now not willingly but the blood coursing through him surged vibrating every inch of his body. He glimpsed her lips wanting to lean down and meet them with his and he felt himself moving forward to do so. He’d not forgotten his manners though even in his drunkenness so he stopped but it was not all from his own doing. A hand was on his chest keeping him back. It made his pride drop and rise at the same time not expecting either of their actions. Her hand was warm even through his leathers and mail or at least he thought it was. Perhaps he was just hot himself.   “Not yet Bracken.” He reached for her hand on his chest able to hold it for a moment but it slipped from his easily. Her hair draped her face as she looked down speaking lowly again.  “Tomorrow you will be on the field as will my brother.” He nodded though she could not see. She continued on looking at him briefly before returning behind her curtain. She reached for his hand able to do so now without tempting him or herself. The idea of tempting her made his mind run wild if that’s what it truly was. “I don’t understand why they let our two houses fight the same melee but it is not my decision I suppose. Just please avoid his gaze. Let another man make him yield. For me.” He could feel himself nodding again with more vigor. The thought of heeding her words of doing something for her was easy as waking washing any thing he did often enough. He was not lying; he would do anything for her and they both knew it at least now that is. She brought her eyes back up to his and he was surprised to see some sorrow in her gaze. She spoke again before he had the chance. “And don’t come into harm’s way yourself.” She smiled teasing him though some sorrow remained. “That may be too unbearable for my frail heart. To lose you both when I’ve barely come to know you.”   He squeezed her hand unconsciously soothing her despite the obvious jest in her tone. He knew it was not all jest. His voice was soft as he reached with his free hand to push a loose strand of hair away from her face all his courage put into the action.   “I will avoid your brother and try my best with the others. I cannot promise I won’t break a limb though. The melee hasn’t provided a death in years but it has provided some maiming.” She laughed again biting her bottom lip. Gods he wanted to kiss her. Her response was quick content.   “Very well I can accept that.” They looked upon each other once more before she slipped her hand away again. He missed it almost reaching for it. His mind raced knowing she was going to depart soon so he asked her another question trying to keep her there even if it was for a moment more. He pointed towards her as he spoke.  “Your perfume. I thought about it all throughout the night but I couldn’t place the scent. I found myself wondering is all.” Her brows raised a little taken aback her nose scrunching as she watched him. He could feel himself redden the question was a little off-topic and nonsensical. She leaned her head to sniff her dress making his own brow rise briefly. She turned back to him almost embarrassed.   “It’s lavender and rose oil. I mix batches at Raventree. Would you like some yourself?” Her question was hesitant not fully understanding his reason for asking. He shook his head his teeth revealing themselves as he grinned at her.   “No I was only curious. It’s lovely.” Her cheeks reddened now as she nodded at him clasping her hands. Her gaze went downwards her feet kicking the dirt just so.   “I suppose I’ll leave you to rest now you have a big day tomorrow.” He nodded once more as she began to drift away. She spoke again as she slowly stepped back looking up at his face meeting his eyes.  “I wish you luck Aeron.” His heart stuttered at the mention of his name the beat deafening his ears. She lingered waiting for his response. He gave it kindly.   “Thank you Bellena sleep well.” She nodded quickly a shy smile appearing as she twiddled her thumbs. They stared at each other a little longer her only a short distance away now. She looked as if she did not want to leave and he wanted to welcome her to stay but knew that was not the best idea as he truly needed the rest. She knew it too finally turning but not before shooting him another grin. She walked off bronze dress glowing against the light of the moon. He sighed releasing the tension from his shoulders though his gut was still churning. He stood there for a minute more thinking of what had just transpired before making his own way back to camp.,2024-07-13 18:16:35 GMT

Daemon isn’t being haunted by what he actually did wrong but by what he actually feels bad about- not getting Jaehaerys killed but by how it effected Rhaenyra and leaving her to deal with the mess. That kind of thing.    Now feel what you want about it but if Rhea apeared to Daemon in a vision he wouldn’t be struck he wouldn’t be scarred he wouldn’t feel bad seeing her- he’d be annoyed.

So much potential!  “My soul is too much charged with blood of thine already.”  An AU in which Aegon II adopts Rhaenyra’s son Aegon III as his own heir only that instead of dying he lives for a while longer slowly shaping Aegon III in his own image.  This is a nature vs. nurture type of a situation: a son of Daemon and Rhaenyra Aegon III becomes a product of Aegon II and his family in every way but by his birth. I would want their relationship to be strained deep and vile a tortured drama in the style of The Lion in Winter. “You love nothing. You are incomplete. The human parts of you are missing. You are dead as you are deadly” type of a parent-child dynamic full of rage misery and longing with both performing the role of a surrogate for the true loved one that their faction has killed. One becomes the son to his worst nightmare and the other—a de facto father to the blood of his real son’s killers to his own blood too because ultimately they do share the same blood like poison poured from the same cup.  Fun detail but though the “you love nothing” line comes from Richard in The Lion in Winter it’s his father Henry II who could serve as a prototype to Aegon III. The son of Matilda (Rhaenyra) he was proclaimed heir by king Stephen (Aegon II) shortly before his death putting an end to the Anarchy. Stephen however did live a fairly long life. In this AU so does Aegon II purely out of stubbornness and spite.  The quote comes from Macbeth.,2024-07-13 20:39:48 GMT

One thing I hate about HOTD is the surface level feminism. No one ever mentions that Alysanne and Barth were behind most of Jaehaerys’ good decisions. I feel like we should be highlighting Westeros’ long tradition of “Behind every Great Man is an even Greater Woman”. And don’t get me wrong Alysanne had a LOT of issues. The main one being she bowed to Jaehaerys way too much. You want to bring Saera back to court? Go get her. It’s as much your court as his. Alysanne would say that her and Jaehaerys ruled jointly but she didn’t act like they did. And The Quarrels were embarrassing for her; are you a child? Girl if you got a problem address that shit. He passed over Rhaenys for heir: don’t just sit there and pout on Dragonstone force him to make her heir. Visenya and Rhaena had the same issue.

But have we considered that dragons don’t actually know any human language?   Like they just understand the emotions and intentions behind their riders? Everyone always assumes that they only speak high Valyrian but could it be because the Targaryen’s only spoke Valyrian just like the other dragon riders in Valyria so of course everyone assumed that dragons only understand Valyrian. I mean just look at poor Luke and Arrax when they were chased by Aemond and Vhagar Luke only really spoke in the common tongue and Arrax felt Luke’s fear and reacted in fear (ie shooting fire at Vhagar). Also remember Jace is shit at Valyrian but Vermax seems to understand him in the common tongue. Aemond who arguably has a good grasp of Valyrian also speaks in the common tongue to Vhagar and she understands him. Rhaenys even said to Meleys they were off to battle again and it seemed that Meleys understood her.   All I’m saying is that dragons don’t really understand language they understand their riders emotions and intentions.,2024-07-13 21:49:19 GMT

But have we considered that dragons don’t actually know any human language?   Like they just understand the emotions and intentions behind their riders? Everyone always assumes that they only speak high Valyrian but could it be because the Targaryen’s only spoke Valyrian just like the other dragon riders in Valyria so of course everyone assumed that dragons only understand Valyrian. I mean just look at poor Luke and Arrax when they were chased by Aemond and Vhagar Luke only really spoke in the common tongue and Arrax felt Luke’s fear and reacted in fear (ie shooting fire at Vhagar). Also remember Jace is shit at Valyrian but Vermax seems to understand him in the common tongue. Aemond who arguably has a good grasp of Valyrian also speaks in the common tongue to Vhagar and she understands him. Rhaenys even said to Meleys they were off to battle again and it seemed that Meleys understood her.   All I’m saying is that dragons don’t really understand language they understand their riders emotions and intentions.,2024-07-13 21:49:19 GMT

In the midst of brewing turmoil and men of the court scheming to gain her favour Demelza finds herself playing a dangerous game of survival both in court and home in Dorne.  “My girls.” Demelza put her arms around them all feeling a surge of love for her children. Her oldest daughters were all grown up and her heart swelled with pride. “Promise me you’ll take care of each other here. Things are escalating every day and I need to know you will have each other’s backs.”   “Of course we will Mother.” It was Elyana who responded with ferocity taking Rhyanon and Ceridwen’s hands in hers. Demelza adored how close they had become for she was not particularly close with any of her own siblings save perhaps Lindon. She had grown up a world away from them and felt she hardly knew them.

When you stopped visiting Dragonstone she knew something was wrong but when none of the ravens she sent asking about your well-being were answered she assumed Alicent was behind it but never did she expect this. Soon as Rhaenyra returned to Dragonstone the maester asked to speak to her in private as a matter of urgency and informed her that you had arrived earlier with a babe.  Her eyes brim with tears as she gulps down “Wha—what is the child’s name?”  “Aelia she’s my daughter” you weep. “Mine and Jacaerys I’m so sorry Rhaenyra.”  You weren’t sure what you expected to happen next. Rhaenyra to let you stay? For Jace to accept his daughter and proclaim his undying love for you? And that you’d live happily ever after? It was a nice thought—more of a foolish dream—to imagine anything good would happen next.  The door to the bedchamber creaks slightly and you turn and see Prince Daemon glaring at you. He storms forward. “What did she just say?” He repeats the question when neither of you answer. “Jacaerys has a bastard with a green? No doubt another trick was orchestrated by those Hightower cunts. How do we know if the child is hers?”  You step back holding Aelia closer. More tears spill from your eyes; it hurts to know he thought of you so poorly especially since you were once so close to Rhaenyra’s small family.  “That’s enough” Rhaenyra says sternly. “Nara is nothing like that; my sister would not lie about such a thing.”  “Is that so?” he snarks only addressing his wife. “I distinctly remember the look on Prince Jacaerys face being similar to the one on yours whenever the greens toyed with you. All the years of cruelty you suffered—”  “I never meant to hurt Jace! I love him” the words blurt out of your mouth. “I—I—I never wanted any of this; you must believe me. I wish things could have been so different.”  Your elder sister’s eyes gloss over again as she watches you place the babe in the cot the master has brought to you. “What happened?”  You swallow hard; it takes all of your strength to not crumble under Daemon’s hateful gaze but you refuse to give him that power over you. “I didn’t know I was with child” you say picking at the skin surrounding your nails. “It was only when Aegon kept making comments about my weight that the queen figured it out. I wanted to tell Jace but I wasn’t allowed to leave the keep or write to him. I wasn’t allowed to see my brothers or Helaena until after I’d given birth; she kept me in complete isolation.”  “King Viserys wouldn’t have allowed that” Daemon hisses.  “My father never knew. The maester told them I had a contagious sickness. And when I gave birth…” A sharp pain shoots across your chest as you feel the weight of your mother’s betrayal crashing down making it difficult to breathe. “They…they…”  Tenderly Rhaenyra strokes at your cheek. “What on earth did they do to you my sweet?”  “They told me Aelia was dead that she died after I’d given birth. I’ve spent all this time mourning my daughter who was alive. She was being kept in the queen’s quarters the entire time.” You try to push the awful memories aside but they don’t budge causing you to sob hysterically. Rhaenyra places her hand on the back of your head gently stroking your hair in an attempt to soothe you. “The midwives who were there have been dismissed from the keep and the only other person who knows is Ser Criston. He’s the one who told me Aelia was alive.”  Daemon and Rhaenyra share an unreadable look.  “There’s still so much I need to share with you sister but…” You wipe your nose with the back of your hand. “I know I have no right to ask but may I tell Prince Jacaerys? I want to apologize for everything in person.”  “You may” Rhaenyra nods her eyes moving to Aelia who was starting to whimper. “He has taken to his bedchambers to get ready for dragon riding. If you’re quick you may catch him before he leaves. I’ll watch over Aelia for now.”  —  The look on Jacaerys face makes you feel sick; he was distraught and looked as if he might throw up. Within the space of a few minutes you’d pulled the rug out from underneath him. Not only did Jacaerys know he was a father but his daughter would be tainted with bastardy like him.  You take a deep breath. “She looks like you. Aelia she has your hair and nose.”  Jace says nothing.  You go over the side of the bed he’s sitting on and kneel in front of him trying to get him to look at you. Jace looked so happy when he first opened the door to his bedchamber and saw you standing there. “Jacaerys please say something. I’m sorry.”  “You’re sorry?” He sounds deflated. “You’ve got nothing to apologize for; you didn’t ask for this.”  “Didn’t I? I chose to have six before marriage; I brought this on myself.“ You wipe away fallen tears with the back of your hand. “You need to believe me that I wanted to leave; I wanted to be with you!”  “It’s not your fault Nara. I wrote to you every day. I tried to see you.”  “I never knew you tried to see me or sent ravens until a member of the kingsguard confessed the queen had them destroy all the ravens.”  You attempt to keep your tears at bay by squeezing your eyes shut but they fall anyway. Jace wipes them away with the pads of his thumb. “I need to speak with my mother. Try and fix this mess before it’s too late.” Seeing the look of hurt on your face Jace tried to retract what he said: “I didn’t mean it in the way that it sounded; I’m just trying to figure out how to solve this before your honor comes into question.”  “I don’t care what people say about me.”  “I do because anything said about us will pass on to Aelia.”  Hearing the pain in his voice makes you cry even harder. “You’re right I’ve just—I can’t think clearly. God only knows what Alicent has spread. I’m scared Jace; you don’t know how vicious she can be. The things that she threatened me with… I can’t forgive her.”  He goes silent for a few moments. “Where is Aelia?”  “With Princess Rhaenyra. Do you want to meet her?”  “Yes… no… I’m terrified.”  A soft smile pulls on your lips. “Let’s go then.”  —  The last few hours have been hectic. You stand in front of the black-painted table studying each of the different houses and their locations on it. A single tear rolls down your cheek. Hearing the footsteps of someone walking up behind you you turn to face them fully expecting to see Jacaerys or Rhaenyra but are surprised to see it’s Daemon. Gulping you lower your head to look at the table again.  “Uncle.”  “We need to speak.”  Oh.  “If you’ve come to call me a Hightower cunt there’s no need. I already know what you think of me and my daughter being here.”  When Jacaerys first laid eyes on your daughter he started to sob and while Rhaenyra comforted her son Daemon became enraged and demanded you take your ‘bastard’ and leave Dragonstone at once which caused him and your sister to argue.  “I used to pray to the gods nightly begging them to bring my daughter back to me and to be reunited with Jacaerys. But never did I think it would be under such circumstances.”  “The gods can give as much as they take. Where is the girl now?”  “Aelia is with Jacaerys and Princess Rhaenyra.” You turn and face the board again. “My sister has shown me more kindness than my own mother ever has.”  He scoffs and comes to stand beside you at the table. “You could have gone anywhere on Dragonback. Why did you come here?”  “I considered going to Essos but when Kain was in the sky I told him to take us home.”  “And Dragonstone feels like home to you?” He asks sarcastically.  “No but Jacaerys does.”  He rolls his eyes “that’s very touching but you have brought fucking chaos into our house. And I want to know what you’re planning to do about it?”  “I want revenge.”  “That is all very touching but you have brought fucking chaos into our home.” Daemon rolls his eyes. “And I want to know what you’re planning to do about it niece?”  “I want revenge.”,2024-07-14 00:35:13 GMT

Red striped dress cut short just past that soft curve connecting her buttocks to her thighs. It’s one of his favourite places to bite on a woman. He already knows what kind of body butter she uses. He found it in the bathroom last night and wore it on his arms after he was done showering off the vomit. There is probably still traces of it on the crease of her skin laced with sweat.  “Stop staring at my ass” Amara says.  “Wasn’t” Aegon lies.  READ IT ON AO3,2024-07-14 00:31:54 GMT

ALSO i havent watched the dinner scene in 2 years and i cannot find it on the sites so excuse any unorthodoxy. ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE im also dyslexic :)    !!!!! this was heavil inspired by the lovely @myladysapphire ’s fic “seduction” which you should go read warnings: some gaslighting dry humping fingering heavy petting making out intoxication        the birth of a child is a joyus occasion for any ordinary family for the royal house targaryen … not always.   it was a sunny summer day when the queen alicent went into labour the sun shined its golden rays upon the keep making its redstone material even more beautifull. while the festivities of the tourney in the babes honor roared outside the noise and cheers and laughter penetrated the keeps walls filling the rooms with the joy of the celebration. all rooms but one.   alicent screamed and whrithed with the unimaginable pain of labour. viserys walked up the stairs with a newfound excitement yet as he reached the door of his wifes rooms he stopped. the weight of his pursuit of an heir the one than killed his first wife hit him like an angry wave. cold sweat ran across his forhead. no his beloved aemmas life was not in vain rhaenyra would sit the throne he rationalized. straightening his posture he oppened the door.   every minute felt like eons for viserys. by the grace of the gods the babe arrived quickly. “a son your grace” said the maester. music to viserys ears. a midwife handed him the swaddled babe. “welcome to the family aegon&quot;said the king. enamoured by his son it took a second before he heard his wife groaning again. &quot;another babe !” exclaimed the maester. “another blessing” chimed in the midwife. and thus a girl was born.  that was how the princess came into the world. a little surprise for her family. a little unwanted surprise.  as the princess grew up that was the word that defined her existance unwanted. not abusedno but she was not the first boy not the heir not even the spare. just another girl.   she came to understand her position very well quiet and demure refusing to cause any fuss around her existance for no one else did.   especially not her older sister rhaenyra. despite the little girls admiration for her rhaenyra never spared her a second glance.she did not mistreat her younger sister by any means just too busy being heir and having children of her own. she had no time for a child that was unwanted in the first place.   Her father on the other hand downright ignored her. the excitement of having a son consumed him in those first years after their birth. there was no love left for her. soon even that ran out and it was as if her and her brother never existed.  it did not matter though she found solace in her other family. the queen alicent loved her daughter dearly not absolved of ignoring her at times in favour of her brother but it was ok she did far more than any other. attached by the hip to aegonthey did everyting together it was only natural the realm viewed her as nothing but an extension of him anyway.   by the time her twelfth nameday came to be it was widely accepted she would be married to her twin. though young she understood the implications of such a proposal. aegon her fathers long awaited male heir would be king and she his queen. the idea rooted in her mind. queen of the realm. the most influential woman of the seven kingdoms. it rooted and festered untill her rambition consumed her everymost descision. to her it was only fair. all the attention she was denyed in her childhood would be atoned for. she would finaly get what she deserved.  the gods had other plans though. more like otto hightower had other plans. rhaenyra proposed a betrothal between helaena alicents secondborn and jacaerys her firstborn. to alicent it was an insult one that had to be prevented by any means.   it was not difficult for otto to get the king to agree to marry helaena and aegon instead. to the king it made no difference the affairs of his daughters whose name were not rhaenyra did not matter.   :readmore:        the news reached the princess on her way to driftmark for her aunt laenas funeral. ser otto hightower upon the queens incistance was tasked with breaking the news.   “that is not fair!” she shouted toward her grandsire franticaly moving around her erratic movements exaderated by those of the ship. “oh hush child you know better than anyone nothing is promised in this life” he responded calm collected slightly irritated.   “but i heard it mother and lord larys saying the marrige would sway the kind toward changing the succesion”. Suddently otto rose from his seat. the princess was throwing a tantrum a dangerous one. if word were to reach the king about their scheming to strip rhaenyra of her heritage it could cost both his and his daughters heads. “now how did you hear such a thing?”. the air had shifted the calmnes in his voice replaced by more irritation and something new. fear perhaps ?  “it… it matters not how i came upon the information it matters that i now know. so please explain to me why i ought to be cast aside in this way. i am a princess !”  “so is your sister. you love your sister do you not?” “i do… but i was promided something and i plan to see it realised” diplomatic words for a child otto thought.   “it does not matter though does it ? you understand rhaenyra is heir yes ?” she nodded. “and your goal as i understand is to be queen yes ?” he had now moved from where he was standing and was sitting next to her on the sette. she nodded again.   “you know of the favouritism your father shows rhaenyra as he sees it she is his only child therefore his only heir”   “but-but father wanted a son he should be the heir” startled by ottos movements her initial anger turned to silent disapointment her little face pouting. “do not go around running your mouth saying such things” he responded hurriedly “you may be a princess but your neck is in as much danger as anyones” he turned to look into her eyes  “we understand the way things are your father however is blinded by his grief. aegon is not heir his wife will not be queen. you would not acquire the power you seek either way.”  “i understand…”.   Satisfied with himself for having stiffled his granddaughters tantrum he turned away once again. “now you are free to take a husband of your choise to seek love is that not what all young maidens dream of ?” her pouting face remained. “love is nothing in the absence of power” otto chuckled if only his daughter had shared that same mindset. the dragon was more hightower than he thought. “in what book did you read that now”.   Before she could answer a knock sounded at the door. the queen entered sir criston in toe. “we are to dock soon return to your siblings at once little one” said alicent somewhat taken aback by the sight of her dughter and father side by side. “yes your grace” said the little girl before quickly exiting.  alicent turned to her father. “i trust you were not corrupting her with any of your sheming” she stated matter-of-factly. “trust me daughter i did not need to… be more careful when speaking with the small council from now on the walls have eyes in the red keep”     after docking the little princess was going through the motions of royal protocol as if possesed certainly lacking the sort of queenly air shed carried herself with up untill that point. it no longer mattered. her dreams were shattered all she ever wanted all she ever hoped for gone in a single boat trip.   vaemond spoke yet none of his words reached her. she looked to her sister rhaenyra from across the procession. the vision of a queen long silver hair braided in the fashions of the queen rhaenys. hugging her children close to her arms arms meant to hold her.   no matter how much she attempted to push these feelings down to pretend her sisters indifference hurt now more than ever. the longer she studied rhaenyra and the longer rhaenyra refused to spare her a single glance she got more and more depressed. so much so she did not notice a pair of big brown eyes next to rhaenyra staring right at her.   after the procession was completed the guests started mingling lords discussing deals families exchanging condolances and such. as a princess of the realm she was excpected to offer her condolances to the family of the deceased she walked forth to greet her cousins baela and rhaena the dragon twins. normally it would be a chance to excersise her queenly grace now it was but another motion. “im sorry for your mother my condolances.” she spat out. “thank you cousin” replied baela. rhaena was solemn only looking at her shoes. her nephews standing next to her she could not care less.   having fulfilled her duty she left without a word. no one would pay attention to the thorn of house targaryen anyway. and none did. except for those same brown eyes from earlier.   as she walked further and further away from the crowd she was greeted by the salty driftmark air. the rough cliffs and architecture were opposite of the red keeps. but it was a welcome change the red keep was a place of lies and dissapointment.  eventually she reached a small nook amongs the salty castle walls. finally some respite. she sat on the ground and took a deep breath.silence. yet peace did not last long. soon footsteps sounded coming toward her untill they stopped.  she looked up. a young boy of dark eyes and darker hair. jacerys velaryon. the firstborn of her firstborn sister. his features struck her even more from up close. she knew the rumors. alicent spoke of them constantly when she thought she was not listening. she may have perpatuated some of them herself on those bad days her sisters rejection particularly stung. she never thought of jacerys never spoke to him as far as she was concerned he was only an extension of her sister.  “what do you want ?” she spat courtly. “i dunno&quot;replied jacaerys.  &quot;its your aunts funeral you should be with your mother and siblings” “dont want to.”   cautiously he sat next to her. they stayed there a while siletly staring at the wild waves ahead. it was…strangely comfortable. jacerys was born a few years after her and despite their both growing up in the red keep togerher they rarely spoke. he knew nothing of his familys distaste for her a stranger to the sins surrounding her name ther girl doubted his mother spoke of her. to him she was practicaly a stranger.   after a while sitting in this comfortable silence he dared speak up. “should we head back ?”. “you should i doubt anyone noted my absence”   “why ?” his voice rung with something unfamiliar to her something akin to…concern. “you cannot note the absence of something you took no notice of in the first place” replied she solemnly. the emotion in her voice surprised even herself something about this boy moved her. the princess did not like it. “i took notice i mean i followed you here” she felt his eyes on the side of her face yet did not dare return his gaze. “…thank you jacerys. why did you follow me ?”  “i thought you looked lonely” if shed turned her head sideways the princess would note him blushing. the comfortable silence returned.      prince jacerys knew not of this feeling bubbling in his chest. he had noticed his aunt during the funeral. he always took notice of her. walking around the keep catching glimpses of her in the library after finishing her studies. his favourite part of training was gazing upon her form framed by helaenas window the yard had a perfect view. he always noticed her always saw her even when she looked elswere. his mother never bothered formally introducing them rarely ever spoke of her. neither did his grandsire. he never went out of his way to greet her either out of fear or nerves he did not know.   today was his window of opportunity. rhaenyra had sent him to comfort his cousins yet he could not take his mind off of his aunt. when she came and greeted baela walking away right after it was perfect. quickly he dismissed himself and slipped away from everyone. the vision of her walking the tumoltous balconies of driftmark silver hair blowing in the wind she looked like a vision calling him to her side. and now here he was.   neither of them knew how long they sat like that. they only knew of the feelings flowing between them. a strange sense of comfort. eventually though they had to return. she stood up first. “come on we must head back your mother is worried about you”  heading back they were greeted by no rhaenyra and no daemon. before jacerys could speak a word to the princess she vanished. he joined his cousins once again they spoke to him yet he heard none of it silently staring at the direction she dissapeared.      the princess awoke the next morning having slept soundly that night a certain strong face haunting her dreams. she arose from her bed and went to call for her handmaidens yet stepping outside the room no guard was present confused and still foggy from sleep she put on a robe and began walking toward her good-sister helaenas room not far from her own. stepping inside she found her sister blankly staring out of the window not unusual for helaena. what was unusual was her complete unacnoledgment of her. cautiously she approached the window. “helaena sister what has happened ?” “he closed an eye..” her sister was always a bit odd most brushed her strange words off but the princess understood the importance of her strange visions   “helaena please speak it to me plainly who closed an eye ?” helaena tore her gaze from the scenery outside vast uneasy brown eyes staring into her sisters   “aemond claimed vhagar late last night lucerys took his eye in return”        years passed since that fateful night in driftmark. the night the house of the dragon official split in two. the two factions came to be known as the greens and the blacks.   she had grown childhood long gone -if it ever existed- now matured into a young woman. what never left was her feelings of betrayal. aegon and helaenas wedding took place not long after driftmark and though she loved her sister deeply jealousy ran deep. helaena was a fool who was handed an opportunity she could not comprehend. it took her some time to get over that day but she did she had to.  despite ottos words on the boat she knew better. after driftmark the greens scheming became more obvious. though she wasnt privy to all information she knew their plans. stupid stupid otto hightower. he told her it did not matter he told her all the things she wanted to hear needed to hear. she hated herself for falling for his honeyed words. she was only a girl of two and ten but still. she ought to have known better. maybe if she had put more pressure onto alicent she would have won. her resentment grew into a monster wild and untameable feeding on her want for the throne.   there was one other consequence of that day she never got to see jacerys again. she never thought it would bother her before but it did. that day the words he spoke to her his tone the genuine concern laced in every sentance haunted her dreams. she dared not think about him while awake fearful of what conclusions she may reach.   fate is funny in its ways. the uncertain parentage of rhaenyras children officialy came into question.   her sisters reckless behaviour came to bite her in the rear the spoiled firstborn finally was to get a taste of consequences. not only that the petitions for driftmark would require the entire family be presentincluding jacerys. not that she cared no.      the view of dragons and ships approaching kings landing was perfect from the princesses window. syrax and caraxes landed near the dock soon the family ship followed. the rest of the way they made by carrige. the lack of reception for the heir and her husband was the princesses own idea. a small revenge.   she dared not venture to the courtyard for she knew her nephews would be there. waiting instead to face them officially in the throne room.   not many are privy to the red keeps secret passageways she was one of the lucky few. in order to avoid the courtyard she followed one such secret hall to cut through the godswood and immedietly into the throne room.   fate as stated before is very humorous.walking through the godswood she was greeted by her most favourite guest rhaenyra. as her sister stood in the courtyard for the first time in her life the princess saw her for what she was a scared mother a woman who knew she had a mess of her own making to clean up. there was no need for approval from such a pathetic creature.   “sister” greeted the young princess. rhaenyra turned to face her. “ah dear sister how are you fairing ?” dear wow the gaul  “i am…well it is nice of you to ask even if for the first time.” the sarcasm did not go unnoticed by rhaenyra. “times change sweet sister attitudes are as moveable as the tides especially within family” the tone those words were spoken in dripped with false sweetness if it were another day she would have lapped it up not today. today she understood they came not from a genuine place but from a need of support.  “when family comes into question the tides of opportunity roar i see” surprised by her sisters words rhaenyra stepped closer.  “i fear the circumstances of our reunion of my arrival are unfortunate that does not mean we need be hostile to eachother” the younger scoffed  “the only times we reunite are under unfortunate circumatsnces. last we spoke i cannot remember i actually cannot recall a time you struck up a conversation with me. only now concerned with your sons succesion when you require my help we speak”   rhaenyra was surprised more surprised than shed been in her life. she thought her relationship with her sister was what it had to be what was required the rift between their family was much vaster than shed realised.  “i am sorry for any pain i have caused you please let us discuss this in a manner befiting of family i promise i am not what these people have told you” she reached for her sisters hand immedietly the younger pulled away.  “these people are my family more my family than you have ever been. do not worry sister i would not concern you with anything beneath what befits you. we need only talk if it concerns the crown.please do not pretend to care for me as family again ypur idifference hurts but false concern is a pain i cannot manage” rhaenyra opened her mouth to speak but could not find the words.   “goodbye dear sister. i look forward to hearing your petition.” and with those words she left fighting the urge to turn back and look at the face of the one who hurt her the most every step of the way.      jacaerys stepped off the carrige and into the ground of the red keep with a goal to see his aunt again. he had grown into a capable and gracious young man in their time apart. she haunted his thoughts and steps toward adulthood in a way he could not describe. it was not love he atleast did not think so more like a strange hunger to see her again.  it scared him to think about. why was this longing so deeply rooted in his chest ?  with lucerys by his side they stepped forward into the familiar courtyard. immediently he gazed upon that same window he knew he may catch a glipse of her in. yet no one was there. it was silly to think someone would. why was his mind like this ?  lucerys must have noticed his wandering glances nudging his side. “what ?” replied jacaerys. “are you ill brother ?”. he had never spoken a word to anyone not about that day in driftmark the events of that night far too heavy to bring upcertainly not of his confusing feelings for the princess.   “im fine lucerys are you feeling well ? it is a difficult day we have ahead of us for you most of all” “im fine.”  he was not fine but it was best not to press on. lucerys had to deal with his emotions on his ownas did he.  the throne room had not changed since last he visited. he and his family stood on one side while the other slowly filled with hightowers and green supporters.   suddently there she was.  the princess targaryen. her blueish green gown only exagerated her beautyful fratures long silver hair shining adorned by intricate braids and golden jewlery. she looked like she hung the sun in the sky. his eyes were trained on her form not moving an inch commiting every detail to memory afraid shed disapear again and take the light with her. and then against all odds she returned his gaze.   it was like seeing the deep blue waves of the ocean again after years in the desert. jacerys vlaryon in all his glory. looking back at her. she dared not tear her eyes away from his familiar brown ones. they stood there surrounded by people yet alone locked in time.  eventually otto hightower announced the start of the pettitions and jacerys had to tear his gaze away. it was not a bad thing though it allowed the princess to study his features more closely. despite his dark brown locks and eyes there was something uniquely targaryen about the boy fair skin and aqualine valyrian nose betraying his heritage. he looked like the carbon of his mother. it scared her it scared her because his resemblance did not deter her emotions at all if anything it made her heart soften toward her sister. no man should hold such power over her.   the petitions went on and on but she heard few words far and in betweeneyes focused on her nephew. periodicaly he returned her gaze studying her with equal intensity alternating between commiting her to memory and comforting his brother.   for the fist time in her life she allowed herself to think of him in detail. she imagined how he would look speaking to her hearing his voice changed by the years matured deep rich manly. she though of his and when she tired she thought of them together. strolling through the gardens flying on their dragons sitting together… waking up next to him walking the altar toward him.  and for the fist time it hit her.   all these years and yet her father had not changed his mind about the succesion once. not once did his resolve to put rhaenyra on the throne falter. aegon would never be king helaena never queen so long as the current kings will persevered. but it did not have to signal the end of her queenly ambition. jacaerys was rhaenyras firstborn her first son and therefore heir. as far as the princess knew he was unmarried and yet to be betrothed to anyone.   the window of opportunity so violently closed by otto on their was to driftmark suddently was wide open again. she could marry jacaerys and finally be queen finally get what she wanted. ofcourse it would mean she would have to support her sister. every end had its means. so be it.   making up with her sister would be difficult yet something about their conversation earlier told her it might not be impossible. the answer to her ambitions was infront of her all these years jacaerys was the key.   euphoria filled her limbs making her mind hazy. floating on a bed of feathers gears already turning in her mind paving the path that would lead her to jacarys. but good things never last.   princess rhaenys was speaking her peace when suddently   “the princess rhaenyra has informed me of her intentions to wed her son jacaerys and lucerys to my granddaughters baela and rhaena a proposad to which i wholeheartedly agree.”     what. what. jacaerys and … baela. she looked upon the ceiling of the throne room as if seeking the heavens vying for the attention of the seven whty did fate punish her so ?. ofcourse why would she get what she wanted ?   she looked toward baela a look of confidence and satisfaction gracing her features eyes trained on jacaerys. she dared not look at him she wanted not to know how he felt of this arrangement.  did he know ? had he agreed to it beforehand ? she could have sworn those looks he gave her earlier meant something. but this was now more than just her feeling toward him. this was about her gtting what she wanted getting her throne.  jacaerys and baela ? no that would not do. she was no longer that wide eyed girl easily dettered by words of her elders easily manipulated into complying with others wishes. one betrothal was torn away from her not again. she would wed jacaerys she decited then and there using any means necessary.      jacaerys heard his grandmothers words the same as his aunt. he was somewhat aware of their plans to betroth him to baela but hearing them actually hearing them spoken in the presance of the king it was another thing entirely.   he briefly looked to baela. she seemed very content with the arrangemend. the same could not be said about him. his aunt had been the sole person to hold his affections thus far. as much affection as a stranger across the bay could atleast.   why was he so dissapointed ? was he even dissapointed ? did he really think there was any merrit to his feelings for the princess ? they shared one conversation all those years ago. whereas he and baela had a solid relatioship a friendship one that could be built upon. hed thought about the betrothal in the past he could find some semblances of feeling in his heart for his cousin.  yet everytime hed thought of baela another crossed his mind.   no that would not do. his aunt was beautifull yes maybe it was just that her beauty that bewitched him the air of mystery around her. it was pointless to assign any meaning to it he descited. he was a prince of the realm. he would preform his duty to baela and to his mother as best he could. childish fancy would have to be put to sleep.  a targaryen event without atleast one murder is considered a dull afair. thankfully they had daemon to provide entertainment.   the king had once again shamelessly supported his firstborn. for a rotting corpse he sure was determined. the death of vaemond velarion signaled the end of the pettitions. lucerys would inherit driftmark along with his cousin rhaena.  rhaenyra would inherit the throne and in turn jacarys along with baela. not if she had a say.  with the first lord to step foot outside of the throne room her plan was set into motion. the alegiance between the blacks and the velaryons was strong but not unbreakable. her sister was an honorable woman a good mother but a less than conscious politician. logic and aliances would not sway her love however would.      the princess knew rhaenyra would reside in her chambers untill the family dinner planned for that night. a little snooping more like a little talk with her ladies maid told her daemon would join his old friends in the gold cloaks for the afternoon. after their talk the princess and her handmaiden were to each take their leave. “oh alia i requre your help with one more thing” the maid turned “anything for you m&#x27;lady”   “i need you to place a rumor..”     with no warning no knock the young princess stepped into her sisters chambers. to say rhaenyra was surprised was an understatement.   “sister what- what brings you here ?” the younger stepped further into the room. “i understand our talk earlier was not to your liking” she began looking to her sisters eyes graced by an unreadable excpression.   “well you made your wishes clear i thought you would not wish to see me unless it was necessary. it gladens me you here though please take a seat” ever so polite. the sisters sat across from eachother on the chambers table for the first time together of their own volition.  “do not misunderstand me i would not have come here unless it was of the utmost urgency. as it stands matters of the crown plague me” rhaenyra looked concerned what matters could the crown possibly have than were not directly concerning her ?  rhaenyra remained quiet waiting to for the younger to show her hand before she revealed hers. “i heard today the proposal you offered princess rhaenys to be frank it is foolish.” rhaenyra was yet to understand the road her sister was going down on she remained quiet.   “keeping aliances strong is of upmost importance if you wish to secure your claim however quality cannot completely trump quantity…”  “what are you saying sister ?” sister finallywithout the dear bold. yet the younger remained quiet pouring herself a cup of the wine placed upon the table. she was bold but her plan bolder it required taming of the nerves. the longer the silence stretched on the uneasier the elder became.  “what do you want ?’ asked rhaenyra finally.   &quot;i want what you want what we all want” rhaenyra understood finally.   “you wish to sit the iron throne then ? is it the reason behind your questioning my alliances ?” she grew irritated of the youngers antics tired of the years being used soely for her birthright her confusion twisting now into anger.  “you would think so but no” she took a big swig of her wine “i want a family my family united. you saw the lords today you saw my grandsire. you may think fathers support is sufficient but he will to be around for long. there will come a time sooner than latter when you will be without your biggest ally and the house of the dragon will be torn apart once and for all”  rhaenyra shook her head “i am the rightfull heir the lords of the realm know who they swore an oath to. i have no need of you false concern.”   “attitides are as moveable as the tides the lords will rally behind whomever they believe benefits them most oaths be damned. our family will be in shambles you must prevent that we must prevent that” she moved now a mix of wine and sudden confidence moving her legs from her initial seat to the one next to her sister.   “wed me to jacaerys” rhaenyras confusion returned. she poured herself a cup and downed it in one go. “and why would i do that ? your void threats ?” “i can support you and your efforts best. rhaenyra looked toward the fireplace turning her body opposite of her sisters. &quot;moonfyre is a formidable dragon and my mother may yet be swayed if we work together”  “i tried once to ally myself with the green counsil they refused. besides  it will be an insult to the house velaryon an insult to my daughter.”   “i am not the green counsil i am your sister.” mirroring rhaenyras earlier movements in the godswood she took her sisters hands into hers. only unlike earlier her sister did not move. “i know you have cast me aside since i first came into the world. yet as a girl i wished every night with every prayer for you to see me finally see me.” rhaenyras eyes as if possesed found her own. an understanding started to bloom.  “i have longed to be by both you and jacaerys from afar all these years let us not be enemies do justice by our targaryen name. if not for an aliance for all you feel toward me as you sister. i have thought of everything you need only say yes.”   rhanyra ture her gaze and hands away once again pouring them both another cup of wine hoping her eyes would not betray her inner conflict. the sisters took their respective cups drinking in silence.   “i knew not of these.. feelings you describe and for that im sorry.” rhaenyra dared speak up. “i cannot give you the yes you seek but if truly your plans are as solid as you describe them i have no way of stopping you” not a victory but not a defeat. “thank you dear sister”   rumors have a way of spreading in the red keep. a phenomenon unlike any other. you could take your carridge for a visit to the great sept a maiden and return a whore. what a sinnfull and dishonorable thing. but what a usefull one to those who know to utilise it.      the queen alicent was enjoying a quiet evening after the very eventfull petitions. helaena on her left embroidering a spider on one of the childrens tunics said children on the floor playing with their toys and her reading “seven histories of seven prayers” all was at peace.   alicent finished her book and made a moved to acqure another the library was near she could go and be back in less than a feather sweep. excusing herself from the company of her family she moved to do just that. the halls of the keep were never to the queens liking much prefering those of her home alas she navigated them low sound of chatter radiating off of each room. gossiping was a sin one the queen refused to indulge in but the day had other plans.  passing through her eldest daughters chambers she caught wind of words that shocked her. cautiously she moved closer to the door hoping her ears were playing tricks.   “i mean can you believe it ? what a sandal our princess and rhaenyras son ? oh the insult” said one of her daughters ladysmaids “alia i am yet to understand how could our lady fraternise with that family they have not seen them in years” replied another “im not saying now maya back then at driftmark”  “i heard it was the reason for the princes fight prince aemond attacked jacarys for dishonoring his sister thats how he lost his eye” replied another.   “and what of todays betrothal ? the queen would never allow such dishonor befall her daughter” “thats the fun part maya the queen knows none of it as for the princess baela she has recently received proposals from the north house tully and house stark however princess rhaenyra forced her hand to prevent herself allying with the greens” replied the voice of alia.  “i believe none of it how could you come upon such information ?&quot;replied the unnamed voice again &quot;the cook told me he overheard an exchange between the young prince and his betrothed..”  the queen stepped back her breathing laboured. they were way off mark for driftmark that was certain. but what if there was truth behind their words ? it would not be unheard of. most rumors around the keep stemmed from some truth   still the queen had faith in her daughter. aegon was a rake sure but he inherited all of the rebelion in the woumb her daughter was as pure as freshly fallen snow. seeking lord larys council would be an option but the queen feared what he would ask for in return. no. she was no fool she would seek for herself the truth.        the dinner was an idiotic idea. alas the head that defies the king does not stay attatched to its body for long. the young princess sat at the head of the table along with aemond already nursing her third cup of wine. it burned going down but not more than her mothers gaze did. she knew.   her mothers gaze threatened to melt her face off but it was not what hurt most. jacaerys and baela sat next to eachother exchanging laughs and pleasantries. if the wine did not cause her to vomit they would. just a little bit longer a little more patience she would get jacaerys and the throne and baela the door.   the night went on oddly calmly. until the speeches began.   king viserrys took the lead. “we have a cause of celebration it seems. jace and luke will be married to their cousinsbaela and rhaena further strengthening the bond between our houses”  if the princesses eyes rolled any further back into her head she would see her brain. she looked to jacaerys his eyes on her only to immedietly be torn away once she looked back.   the king continued with his heartfelt speech somewhere among the words of uniting the house of the dragon rhaenyra and her sister locked eyes the understanding between them having bloomed into a garden. her fathers worlds were certainly the missing piece to convincing rhaenyra of the betrothal.   rhaenyra took her turn followed by alicent heartfelt words betraying the affections the two still shared. jacaerys was next. despite him talking about aegon and aemond his eyes fell on her periodically never too long though. as if looking at her too long would turn him to stone. his fear was evident but was it brought about by alicents menacing stare or …. his own emotions ?   it was better not to mangle matters of the heart with those of the crown she had to remind herself despite her chest thumping with every glance. helaena gave her speech toasting the happy couple yet again. her words on marrige brought about a sense of uneasines to everyone. rhaena bless her heart made an attempt to mend the situation “it leaves you cousin. have you any suitors ?”.  rhaenyra tensed alicent even more so but most of all jacaerys. his stiffness caused baelas concern who nudged him lightly. her movement laboured no reaction from the prince she turned instead to find the object of his gaze none other than his aunt.   “n-no not of yet im afraid…” she gave her best semblance of a calm reply. rhaenyra feeling bad and still mindfull of their earlier conversations took the liberty of replying “it is best not to worry about these things you may yet find your affection in unlikely places”  alicent gave a blank stare she moved her mouth to speak but was interrupted by none other than daemon. “best not to wait though my dear a young lady may fall to her charms only for so long…” his words earned him hateful looks and one of firm diaproval from his wife. his eyes however gleamed playfully ever the provocatour. daemon knew.  she could not hold back her emotions if she wanted. opting to give a small sad smile for an answer would surely betray her tears. she looked to jacaerys. this time his eyes unapologeticaly on her looking to her form with raw pitty. helaena took her hand and aemond gave her a small pat on the arm. alicents anger was on the brink of overflowing.   before the queens wrath could be unleashed upon demon the king groaned in pain immedietly he was escorted away by the guards. the family was left in shambles once again. yet the evening was far from over. rhaenyra ordered for music to be played more courses arriving at the table. the princess cared for none of it the plan was working yet daemons words stung all the same.  a hand appeared next to her asking to dance. looking up to find the owner she found none other than jacaerys velaryon. she stood up quickly ignoring her mothers gaze taking it into hers.   the unwanted child of house targaryen she was unused to being shown attention most of all the sole attention of her beloved. a familiar melody sounded in the backround years of observing others on the dancefloor yet never joining left her entirely unprepared for the dance that was to come. jacaerys noticed her nerves.   “do you know the stepps ?” she shook her head no. the reaction brought a smile to his face genuine and warm. “not to worry it is not a difficult one you only need a capable lead”  arriving finally to the dancefloor the music picked up. jacaerys hands led her to stand infront of him. since he noticed her uneasined his eyes had not left hers once.   he began the dance jumping left and right she soon joined his pace. it felt like ascending the skies on her dragon for the first time each little jump leading her further and furhter away from the ground away from the drama of her house and into the heavens.   his pace changed stepping forth to take her hand into his. the toutch was electrifying gentle yet firm he brought their joined hands to eye level gaze forever steady on her form like the eternal rocks beneath the tumoltous sea somewhat grounding her. they began to turn around eachother. slowly at first he began to hasten his turns having now to hold on tighter keeping eachother in orbit.   jace took a step back moving their joint limbs above her head intending to spin her around herself his other hand gently on her waist as to keep her steady. the wine was taking effect for before she could turn to face him again she stumbled slightly falling forward straight into his arms.   he did not let her fall however the hand on her waist immedietly snaking around her fully the one above her head going to hold the side of her face preventing it from coliding with his. by the time she gained her balance the position between them was highly innapropriate. the warmth of his hand on her cheeck made all skin receptors go haywire. his lips had slightly parted and she could feel his breath on her own if she leaned a little forward she could even….  “THAT IS ENOUGH !” queen alicents booming voice sounded. their moment of tenderness so rudely interrupted the princess pulled away from her nephew he complied taking a half-step back his hand previously on her waist however moved to hold hers once again.   “ do you take me for a fool ? sharing words of support and love to my family while your son has corrupted my sweet daughter laughing now in our faces i will have it no longer !”  everyone was shocked rhaenyra held onto her husband who moved to stand up aegon and aemond shared a look equal parts amusement and comradery while rhaena and lucerys held hands. the only one to keep his composure was the queens father. ooto knew. baelas legs were bouncing up and down furiously. everyone was in dissaray.   “what are you implying your grace ?&quot;sounded daemon full of rage and malice. &quot;i am implying nothing i am up and stating it since your family is playing the fool. your son has corrupted my daughter tainted her virtue and has now come to flaunt his debauchery infront of everyone! ” jacaerys remained quiet his hand unmoving.  like fish to bait the princess thought. she anticipated the queens reaction what surprised her was how public it was. a new variable. no matter she had come this far no way in the seven hells would she quit now. her eyes searched for and found rhaenyras her beautifull face painted one sentance i hope you know what youre doing.  “daughter please regain your composure.” otto attempted to calm his queens nerves. one public outburst escaping the family was bad two would be ruinous. rhaenyras eyes remained locked with her sisters the two communicating simply from eye contact. the younger sent a pleading look. not wishing to anihilate the little pieces of reconciliation the dinner had acheived the heir sprung into action.   “please your grace it has been an eventfull evening let us not end the night in animosity. the hour is late we ought to all retire and discuss this with the light of the new day.” daemon went to express his rage his atempted outburst swiftly sqashed by rhaenyra holding his arm. lucerys and rhaena immedietly stood up followed by helaena exiting at once not wishing to partake in the conflict.   alicent attempted to voice her dissagreement rage and adrenaline pulsing in her veins but could not the hand of her sworn shield along with her fathers stern gaze bringing her to reality.  aemond stood approaching the still-frozen couple. his imposing frame cornered that of jacaerys “carefull nephew should i find any truth to these accusations i will ensure you pay the price this time” and with that he pulled his sister away. she turned to look to her beloved for the final time time of the evening their eyes locked a silent promise to speak again.     the events of the night were all blurry in the young princes head. whithin less than a day he reunited with his aunt was btrothed to baela descited to put aside his feelings for his aunt witnessed a beheading had his feelings for his aunt reignited and was now accused of deflowering her.   after she was so rudely torn away from him the prince was faced with the fury of his betrothed. baelas face twisted in a way he had only previously seen on daemon it petrified him. “is it true ?” asked the girl. “what ? i dont-”   “it is a simple question jacaerys are alicents words true ?” “ofcourse not ! i would never do such a thing” tension was rising with each exchange of words “what was this buisness today then ?” “the princess fell what was i to do ? allow her to fall ?”   “she is the enemy jace you cannot trust these people” the words coming out of baelas mouth filled him with rage never before experienced “the enemy ? are you being serious ? you know nothing about the princess-” “neither do you.”   they were almost yelling daemon started to advance toward them. afraid of his stepfather he attempted to deescelate the situation.“i do apologise for any discomfort i have caused you baela but i will not stand to hear such nonsense.”   baela scoffed “if you are unable to see past the intentions of those who only mean to use you i hold in my heart not discomfort but pity for you my prince. goodnight. ” and with that she exited. by this time deamon hat taken the place of his daughter “come we have much to discuss” looking behind him one final time to see his mother and queen alicent speaking quietly he followed his stepfather.   they walked the halls of the keep solemnly daemons calm demeanor betrayed none of his emotions it only irritated jacaerys more and more as time went on. each torturous step made his mind race from the dance to the fight to the princess to her hands to his betrothed to daemon to his aunt again her lips her smile her body against his… it all was far too overwhelming.  the salvation from his torture came with their arival at his chambers. “come” daemon instructed oppening the door he could only follow instructions with the reverance of a septon executing the gods will afraid of arousing his uncles rage. “sit” he sat his uncle soon occupying the chair next to him.   “so did you do it ?”   if one more person asked him that question jace swore he would throw himself from the tallest window of the keep. “no i would never” daemon chuckled. “tis alright boy the flame of youth roars with unparalleled passion in this family especially i would not have blamed you if you had.” jace swallowed a weight lifted from his chest.   “alas what i believe matters not only what the queen does and as it stands she thinks you deflowered her most favourite daughter. how do you plan to answer these accusations ?”   “i…..i do not know. i would not go back on my promise to baela sir. i swear it” daemons hand reached his sons shoulder. “i know. worry not about baela. we must understand what possesed the greens to spread such a rumor they are coming for your inheritance boy the same as your mothers.”  heavens give me strength the young prince thought. “with all due respect you know nothing of who spread such a rumor. the princess would never soil her reputation in such a way. ”  “damn right she would not the princess is far from cunning enough” jacaeys hands turned to fists “it is certainly the work of her grandsire” he had had enough. “you only see the events of today as an excuse to express your violence”   “such are the tactics of war. we can not be seen as weak at this time jace. they mean to take yours and your mothers birthright to start the war and tear our forces apart-”  “i see finally you care not for me nor baela only for supporting the efforts of a war yet to materialise if it even is to materialise. you only seek glory for yourself- ” “myself ?” daemon interrupted “all i do i do in support of you and your mother”   “then allow us to counsil my mother before you jump straight to actions which might soil her name” daemon gave no answer. his wife was his weakness jacaerys knew it very well. and though he was prone to brash violet actions he did so in servitude of his family.   daemon stood up sudently still not having said a word. the young prince knew he had not quelled his bloodlust but the seeds of doubt planted in his mind would keep him occupied long enough. and so daemon exited.   before jacaerys was allowed a moment of respite not a few seconds after his fathers exit the painting near his window opened from behind.   emerging from the shadows none other than the princess. jacaerys was left speechless the night kept becoming stranger and stranger. “what-the…what h-how did you get here ?” he chocked out.  “i found a sort of map of the red keeps passageways when i was young. one of them leads from my chambers to these” replied the princess shyly. “have i disturbed you….i should leave my apologies-”  “no !” exclaimed jacaerys. the day had taken a toll on him daemon and baelas words giving him a lot to proces. one thing had not changed though he still longed to see her.   turning around from her attempt to exit the princesses face became illuminated by the candelight showcasing her hopefull expression. a beat of silence pased neither one of them knowing how to approach the other. the princess stepped forward fully entering the room.   he could now see her dress in detail a pure white nightgown flowing gently encasing her form. she looked like an angel sent from the heavens.   “my mother is very protective of me you must excuse her earlier actions she only meant to do good. i-i came to apologise for what went down at dinner” by now she was standing but a step away from him. the prince remained frozen afraid if he let his body move he would no longer remain a gentleman.   his silence caused the princesses face to fall slightly a disapointed expression threatening to take over the same one from earlier that night. he wished not to ever see her that way ever again “is that all you came here to do ?” he spoke up at last.  a small smile played at the side of her mouth “if i may excpress myself freely my lord ?” the pang of excpectancy in his chest rattled his body “jace and please do.”   “jace” she began the familiarity of the petname causing him to grow bolder. “i must say though these rumours are heinous i- i was ashamed not of my soiled reputation but for the fact they included you” the woman infront of him was a witch jace descited she was bewitching him with every word from her soft lips and he was oh so willing to fall for her spell.  “truth be told i have not forgotten of the time we shared at driftmark it may seem silly but since that day i have longed to see you again.&quot;she continued &quot;i know not of love …or lust but these feelings lay in my chest for so long i fear they may drown me”   her eyes looked to his through her lashes longing excpecting. once again he was left without words. “jace ? you instructed me to speak freely have i made you uncomfortable ?” her hand flew forward from her side softly brushing his knuckles sending chills to his body threatening to take his hand into her own but hesitating.   “are are you cross at me because of the rumors ?” the last bits of his composure were starting to crumble egged on by both her words and feathelike toutches.   “i could never. i would never hold over you something you have no control over” he replied unable to take her teasing toutches any longer taking his hand away in favour of toutching her elbow bringing her closer so much closer her other hand flew to toutch his chest.  mirroring his actions at the diner he placed his hand upon her cheek. “oh im so glad” she said in a breathless whisper.  “you had no play in spreading the rumors yes ?” her mouth oppened and closed eyes and body growing uneasy “y-yes how could i do something like that ? to you of all people” jace sucked in a hurried breath cursing himself for almost ruining the moment.   he brought her closer hand moving once again from elbow to back possesive and supportive. his thumb began to caress her cheek seeking retribution for his previous words. “ofcourse ofcourse you spilled your heart to me and i have gone and accused you.”   “no i understand.” their faces were now only centimeters away heavy breaths in tandem with eachother “there are many forces at play intending to keep us apart” jace continued. the words of daemon now but a whisper in his head caution having flown from the window the moment she toutched him.  “do you give them any thought ?”  “i could not if i wanted to. you say you have longed for me since driftmark my longing dates even further back. this force is pulling me toward you like the morning pulls the sun from its hiding and i fear if you were to be taken from me now i would never see the light again”  and with that the water tipped over his lips clashed against her. all the emotions pent up over the years releasing in a dance of mouths and tongue. her hands flew to his his hair trying to express all of the things words could not.  slowly the princes pushed her leg between his casuing him to step back slowly tracing a path toward the bed. when he felt the foot of the bed on the back of his knees he did not hesitate hands snaking to her thigh he lifted her slightly and fell back ever so carefull to not hurt her or to break the kiss.   her nightgown did little to hide her form now slowly falling off her shoulder exposing her chest. his mouth left hers for the first time only to trace a path down her neck. her hands pushing his face further into her hungry for more.   his hands on her thighs moved further and further up skirts riding up with them. her core now bare on his trousers right where he needed her most soft skin brushing up against hard fabric sending pleasured pulses to both her bodies.   she started moving her hips shyly back and forth head falling back the mewls escaping her lips music to his ears. by now the arousal in his pants was evident the friction from her movements doing little to aleviate his tension.   desperation was fogging his mind movements going from passinate to hungry. sloppy open-mouthed kisses on her neck moving lower and lower a silent prayer of devotion on her breast all he could think hear and feel was her.   lost in eachother and the new sensations they hearn naught og the comotion outside the rooms door.  without warning rhaenyra acompanied by the queen entered the room. the lovers were caught once and for all now bound together by duty. alicent began her scolding rhaenyra agreeing with her and joining. jacaerys took no time in taking a protective stance shielding the princesses face in his shoulder raising her nightgown back on her shoulder trying to maintain whatever semblance of was left to her name.      the princess awoke in her own chambers sadly the events of last night still ringing in her head. she could still feel the heat of jaces body on her face waist and lower… she knew she ought to be ashamed to order a carridge to the sept straight away and beg on her knees for forgiveness. yet she found no desire to do do.  satifaction filled her lungs with every breath. after alicent and rhaenyra had caught them jace was dragged away by his mother yet he accepted the consequences with a stiff lip and an air of pride. alicent still was clinging to her daughters innocence refusing to accept the situation as anything but her poor daughter being manipulated.  when aemond heard of the news he attemptet to take some form of retribution going as far as to propose a duel with jace in her honor. aegon had never looked so amused in his life he only congradulated his twin saying “atleast you sampled the mount before you commited”. her grandsire was once again the most composed figure of the evening out of satisfaction of securing his blood on the throne she thought. helaena had yet to learn of anything.  they had barely goten any sleep counseling all night in search of an answer to the situation. only one was viable. after the green and black council debated a clear course of action was set.   given the fact there was no chance of the princess being with child they would release a statement announcing the betrothal of the crown prince jacaerys to the secondborn daughter of the king reuniting the realm stated as the reason. the date of the wedding would be set in thee moons time as not to arouse any suspicion. as for princess baela negotiations for herbetrothal to lord cregan stark were already underway.   she walked to her vanity lazily brushing her hair. the smile on the woman in the mirror looking back at her she had not seen in years. each movement of her wrist was excecuted with queenly grace. life had meaning once again.  she stayed there a while pampering herself for she was a victor when a certain tapestry on her wall came out of place.   in stepped none other than jacaerys velaryon. jace. her jace. her future husband.  “jace” she said standing up. “you look… satisfied” began the prince all shyness from the night before gone. “should i not be ?” teased she. jace remained silent somewhat sullen looking to her form the morning light revealing to him just how transparent her nightgown was.  “i spoke with my mother last night she revealed to me some new information” the princess tensed afraid she was caught in her lies afraid all of her effort was for naught. his composure as he advanced toward her did nothing to sooth her nerves. he began to circle her form patiently awaiting an answer. “wh-what would that be my prince ?”  he stopped behind her. was it the formality of the title that caused his pause ? or was it anger ? “she said you wenr to her yesterday to plead your case for our betrothal. she said you almost begged to be perscise”   he had not corrected her calling him her prince leading her to the natural conclusion he was angry. “i-i apologise for not making you aware of such a fact last night. i hadnt the time to you see…” she craned her face back to look at him. begging with her eyes for some sort of reaction.   he looked down to her something dark behind his brown eyes. “how do you explain such an action ?” he said voice low and grainy.  there was little room of escape. she had to play her hand just right. “as i said i hadnt the time to fully explain myself to you. it is true i looked to rhaenyra to ask for your hand and…. the rumors were really not the reason but the excuse for my actions. i meant to… approach you from before” he remained silent.   she made an attemt to turn around and face him only to be prevented by his pressing himself to her back. “baela is of the oppinion wish to use me. both her and daemon said you mean to steal my mothers throne to take from me what you want only to betray me. tell me it is not true.” finally his true colors came to light. the darkness in his eyes was not born of malice but of desperation of fear.   “please you most not misunderstand my actions i only meant to be with you i have not lied i woud never. my family knew nothing of it. i understand how this must come across but please believe me you must.” her joice unashamedly betrayed her desperation to please him he remained silent still only holding onto her tighter.  “what must i do to make you believe me ? i will beg on my knees if it please you just trust me…” his body relaxed just slightly hands remaining on her stomach clinging to her dress. he gave a long exhale.   “i believe you” it was her turn to sigh runing her hands on his arms tracing lines over his toned forearms. “i believe you are a cunning spider who pounced on the opportunity to claim me for yourself.” his hand ascended her stomach reaching the space just under her chest playing with the ribbon tying adorning her gown. “i also believe your intelect to be so infatuating i cannot help but want you more…”   he pulled the end of the ribbon her dres becoming looser. “tell the truth did you stop to consider the possible consequences of your reckless actions once ?” his hand went higher unbuttoning the top of her dress torturously slow.   “i only thought of you every step of the way.” he continued his pursuit of unbuttoning her gown. “does this mean you accept my apology ?”  “yes my darling you need beg no longer… besides i would much prefer to see you on your knees for other purposes” with that he spun her around putting their lips together once again. only this time the kiss was less passionate and more possesive. they knew they were bound together forever.  her gown was barely hanging onto her body jace shruged the sleeves off her shoulders the gown pooling on her feet. he took a step back breaking the kiss to look at her. look at her whole. he drank in the sight of her body like the sweetest of wines. “perfect” he muttered under his breath but before the princess had a chance to reply he took her into his arms mouths clashing once again.   effortlessly he carried her to the bed gently placing her head on the pillows climbing on soon after. her hands reached to toutch his chest tugging on his tunic begging to have it removed. he complied hastily unbuttoning it. the morning light illuminated his porcelain skin showcasing his toned arms and chest.  his mouth descended upon her continuing his previous actions. one leg on her side the other nudged her legs apart knee pressing onto her core. she moaned upon the contact earning a chuckle from jace. “you are magnificent” he said innetween kisses. “my cunning girl”  the fabric on his knee got wetter by the second dampness reaching the skin underneath. his hand traced a path from her side down to her navel to her pelvis finally to where she needed him most. he began his ministrations on her pearl tracing slow circles each one sending waves of ecstasy along her body they reached her throat leading her to release a pleasured moan. “please keep quiet darling i would hate to be interrupted yet again”  his fingers on her core went lower seperating her slit pressing onto her. “wh-what-” she whispered trying desperately to hold back her moans “shhh worry not my dear i only mean to please”   “all i do i do to please you my love” with that his fingers penetrated her. sensing her incoming moan jaces hand flew to her mouth muffling her sounds only for him to hear. his fingers began to move setting a slow rythm allowing her to get used to the foreign sensation.   it was as if he had studied her body for years the reverance with which he treated her left a burning sensation in both her heart and core. he continued slowly picking up his pace settling into a new rythm his thumb took to restarting the ministrations on her pearl. she felt a knot forming in her stomach tesion on her chest becoming more and more and more…untill she felt she could go on no longer.   “j-jace…” she chocked out “i know i know darling…” he placed a tender kiss upon her forhead “let go its ok…” with that the tension in her stomach exploded pleasure enveloping her body settling into her limbs. “thats my girl..”   how long she spent lost in the throws of ecstasy she knew not a fog of pleasure clouding her mind leaving her to think only of jace. once she started to come out of it a bit he slowly removed his fingers earning him a whine at the loss of contact. he only chuckled.   she went to remove her lovers trousers but he prevented her movements taking her hands and giving each of them a kiss instead.   “allow us to keep something to look forward to on the wedding night.” he said positioning himself next to her on the bed placing her head to his chest playing with her long silver hair. they stayed like that a while simply enjoying the company of one another.   the princess spoke up “what is on you your mind my prince ?” he made an insulted face placing a hand of his heart “ do not call me that again lest you want me to be cross with you.” she chuckled her happiness causing his heart to swell with pride he was the reason behind her laugh “i am simply admiring my future wife”   she raised her torso to kiss him again all soppy and sweet. “i do have one last question to ask.” she fully raised her body legs across his lap and head neeling on his shoulder. “please do future husband”   “last i spoke with daemon he was ready to go to war in the name of preventing our betrothal. yet this morning he was all smiles and agreement i know it was not the efforts of my mother alone. what did you do ?”   “i fear if i answer that you may turn to cast me aside” she said begining to leave little kisses and kitten licks onto his neck. he took her jaw into his hand seperating it from his neck moving her to look into his eyes “we are in this together now fully my love. i wish to know of my wifes nature for i know i will come to love it i already have.”  “well if you insist… my ladys maid worked under the lord stark her father is a steward tasked with writting many of his lords official letters. she learned to writte in her fathers handwritting and well… a certain letter arrived late last night detailing the request of the lady baelas hand for his son cregan”   jacaerys gave a hearty laugh “ and it really took affect ?”   “ofcourse it did. the lord of winterfell will not question the crowns words they know better than to refuse an alliance with our house. by the time the source of the betrothal comes into question we will be on our honeymoon and alia settled with her own lover in braavos”   she looked to his eyes attempting to find any disgust anything that would show her she was unwanted by him aswell yet jace only looked to her with love and admiration. “you truly are a marvel my spider” he kissed her forhead one again then her brow her nose finally her lips.  “i hate to be taken away from you however….” he began tearing his body from hers seeking his discarded tunic. “we have a scheduled promenade soon. your mother is taking all the steps necessary in making us look like a prim and proper couple” he began puting his tunic back on the sight of his back muscles flexing giving the princess another rush of arousal.   she chuckled and changed her possition on the bed stretching her body intending to entice her lover back into joining her. he turned around to face her once last time the heavenly sight of her bare body making him question just how important appearances actually were. “do not play games with me girl i should hate to disapoint the queen again”   “i said nothing…&quot;she teased. &quot;you neednt say anything. one day you will be queen and you may torture our children in such a way or any way you see fit” he added. she smiled so wide it illuminated every corner of the room. “whatever you say my king” he looked back once again on his attempt to exit.    “treasonous girl. goodbye my queen”,2024-07-14

Warnings: Aegon being Aegon Canon events surrounding Aemond’s 13th birthday and the Madame (no explicit details.)  129 AC  The ocean water is warm today. It foams up as it crashes onto the shore where she stands barefooted. Today is a day full of uncertainties and untameable nerves. Today is the day she wil claim a dragon.   “You will become sick standing in the sea like that.” Jace says   “The ocean is warmer here on Dragonstone than on Driftmark.” Rhaella says dismissing his concerns.  “Are you excited?” He asks standing beside her letting the ocean wash over his boots.  “I am nervous. Sona has never been claimed before.” She sighs   “I am sure you will be able to do it” Jace assures her   “That is easy for you to say Vermax hatched while you were still a babe.” She sighs   “All true Targrayens are dragon riders. I will not see one of my children remain dragonless.”   Rhaella whips around to see Daemon approaching. He is relentless in his father-daughter bonding attempts.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; “Jacaerys your mother wishes to see you.” Daemon says   Rhaella ignores how he stands next to her after her cousin has left the beach. Waves crash against rocks as her eyes remain fixed on the horizon.  “This silent treatment is becoming old. You are ten and four you’re no longer a child.” He reminds her   “What does Rhaena think of me doing this?” She asks ignoring his comment “Of me trying to claim a dragon before her?”   “Her thoughts are not important….Sona has rejected her attempts before.” Daemon says “This dragon is for you Rhaella no one else.”   Daemon’s words are touching. Their relationship is still a rocky one though. The past three years have been spent with him flying between Dragonstone and Driftmark. After his marriage to Rhaenrya she had expected that he’d abandon her Baela and Rhaena. And yet every few weeks he’d show up on the shore with Caraxes at his side. He’d spend time with her younger sisters and then come barging into her room as though he owned the entire castle. It had taken many moons for them to have a fully civil conversation devoid of yelling and rude comments but eventually they formed a sort of friendship. That of course did not mean they got along just that she had come to tolerate him since he seemed intent on not leaving her life.  “The Dragonkeepers say that it is best to approach Sōna now. She enjoys afternoon naps and will become angry if we disturb her later in the day.” Daemon says   Sōna’s lair is darker than any night sky Rhaella has ever seen. Water drips from somewhere as she points the torch in front of her trying to see where the dragon might be. Gods she hoped she was not about to be eaten.  Another 50 paces into the cave and Rhaella is beginning to think the Dragonkeepers have lied about this dragon existing at all. The dampness of the cave is beginning to seep into her bones she swears every hair on her body has stood up on alert.   And then there is a glitter of white meeting her eyes the fire that barely illuminates a few steps in front of her has reached something magnificent.   Sōna’s brilliant blue eyes are staring at her. Rhaella is looking into the eyes of a dragon. A shiver snakes through her body as she maintains eye contact and slowly drops the torch.   “Zaldrīzes rȳbus lo mērī udrirzi Valyrio eglio ȳdrassua”  Daemon’s last words before she had entered this lair echo in her mind.   A dragon only listens if you speak in High Valyrian.   She finds herself unsure of what to do now so she speaks and prays to every god there is that this beast does not open her mouth to burn her alive.   “Iksā gevie.” She says slowly “Eman dreamed hen ao syt ñuha giez ābrar.  You are beautiful. I have dreamed of you for my whole life.   Sōna lets out a deep rumble and Rhaella is unsure about the dragon’s thoughts on her compliment.   She slowly begins to move towards the side of Sōna’s head. The dragon lets out another grumble as she draws close.   &quot;lykirī. Iksan daor kesīr naejot ōdrikagon ao.”   Calm down. I am not here to hurt you.   Rhaella’s heartbeat pounds in her ears as her hand touches Sona’s rough skin.   “Kesi sagon rōvēgrie raqirossa Sōna. Mazeminna care hen ao lo ao ivestragī nyke claim ao”  We will be great friends Sōna. I will take care of you if you let me claim you.   Rhaella gently runs her bare hand along Sōna’s jawline. The dragon lets out a sharp sound almost like a trill of sorts. Rhaella smiles as Sōna lets her continue. Has she truly done it? Has she truly claimed a dragon of her own?   Sōna lets out another gurgle before pushing her head further into Rhaella’s waiting arms.   “Sir iksi hēnkirī ēva morghon ñuha riña. Nyke kivio naejot gaomagon ao ȳgha”   Now we are together until death my girl. I promise to keep you safe.  Her voice is no more than a whisper into the cave but the dragon hears it all the same. Rhaella cannot help the wide smile that stretches across her face when her dragon lets out a noise of agreement.   “The winter snow reaches out and claims a woman. Black banners rise behind them. Green rises to meet the snow.”   Aemond is unsure what to make of his sister’s words. He had come to her room to play with his little niece and nephew who are learning how to stand on their own. They babble with happiness when he shakes a wooden dragon in their faces.   “The snow will meet green over fields of fire and blood” Heleana says not bothering to look up from her needlework.   “They are growing quickly.” Aemond says hoping to turn the conversation to something more lucid and interesting for him  “They eat often. The boy more than the girl.” Heleana says to him   “You will sit the Iron Throne one day Jaehaerys” Aemond says to the baby who grabs at his hand and attempts to place it in his mouth   Aemond smiles down at his nephew and niece they are two of the few living beings in this castle that do not fear him.   The castle is bustling with life as it often does during the day. Maids scurry about cleaning and rat catchers lead their dogs about the halls. The feel of his practice sword in its sheath is a familiar one as he makes his way toward where Cole awaits him in the training grounds. Normally he’d try to rouse Aegon from his sleep but it had been weeks since he had successfully dragged his older brother from bed to train.  The clashing of steel is better than any music he’s heard as Cole points out how to hold his arms in a way that keeps the sword from being knocked from his hands.   Aemond takes note of how he is rapidly approaching his teacher’s height. The top of his head is finally in line with Cole’s eyes just a few more years and he is sure he will outgrow him after all he is already a bit taller than Aegon.   “Have you heard the news?” Cole asks in between sips of water from a large flagon that sits nearby.   “What news?” Aemond asks not recalling anything his mother might have told him this morning at breakfast.   “Word from Dragonstone to the king. Rhaella Targaryen has claimed a dragon.” Cole says “Queen Alicent read it this morning to his grace.”   Rhaella had a dragon? Aemond wondered what dragon she might’ve claimed. He knew there were many unclaimed ones on Dragonstone. He tried to imagine the delicate Rhaella on the back of a beast like Vermithor. It was rather humorous in his mind.   “What dragon has she taken?” Aemond asked   “Your uncle conveniently left that out my prince” Cole said   Of course Daemon would leave that out. Aemond had wondered what changed between Rhaella and Daemon. The last time he had spoken to Rhaella she had been deadset on pretending he didn’t exist and now he was helping her claim some unnamed dragon. Maybe he ought to write her again. Things had been tense when he hugged her goodbye on Driftmark’s shores. Her nose had still been swollen from his punch which he regrettably had yet to apologize for.  For the first year they had exchanged many letters talking of mundane things such as Rhaella’s struggle with holding swords upright during her training with the Master of Arms at Driftmark. And how he had discovered that growing up also meant being forced to stand still for measurements to be taken regularly as he was outgrowing all his favorite clothes. Eventually though the letters became less frequent and one day stopped entirely. His mother said it was part of growing up and that it was all for the best since she was “separate” from their family. Aemond tried to believe her he truly did but at night when he lay in his bed he found himself missing Rhaella’s companionship.   “Shall we continue?” Cole asked snapping him from his thoughts.  Aegon could not believe he left his chamber for this. Surely his bed and cups of wine were better than all of this.  “It is your brother’s name day try to look presentable.” His mother had hissed in his ears when she pulled him down the many steps of the Red Keep.  Aegon did not care about Aemond’s name day. Why should he care if his brother was ten and three? Aemond was going to have a thousand name days Aegon didn’t see why he should bother himself to be at all of them.   He still could barely believe his Lord Father had been able to plan and attend this family dinner. Viserys had sent the invitations himself apparently wishing for his family to gather for Aemond’s name day. Aegon still thought it was a dull idea.   His eyes scan the dinner table and they land on Princess Rhaenys or more specifically who was next to her. His Uncle Daemon’s three daughters loud-mouthed as they were had grown Aemond’s friend most of all. That blue silk dress of hers was doing nothing to hide the curves Aeggon could practically taste from across the table.   “Stop your staring.” His…dear Grandsire said sending a kick to Aegon’s shin under the table   Aegon knows he is dense but even he does not miss they way Aemond’s eyes…or well eye…remain fixed on Rhaella through the night. Perhaps he has underestimated his little brother maybe there is more to him than books and sword training with Cole. Perhaps this was finally a chance for Aegon to introduce Aemond to true fun.   He can feel the smirk stretch across his face as he plans their evening in his mind. Yes it was finally time to bring Aemond into his world to show him what other fun there was to be had.  Rhaella has never felt more awkward. When Rhaenys had announced that they would attend a dinner for Aemond’s name day at the request of King Viserys she wished she could be like Lord Corlys and simply declare she would not go. It was not that she did not want to see Aemond she just felt distant from him.Perhaps it was the lack of apology for her face or maybe it was the three years that passed since she had chosen Driftmark over him. She swore he was still upset about all of that.   Aemond’s eye had been on her the whole night Rhaella couldn’t tell if that was a good or bad thing.   When they had first arrived Rhaella had sought him out perhaps it was just a force of habit but she had found herself at his door. When she peered in she had expected Aemond to look the way he did when she said goodbye to him on the shore of Driftmark a snot-nosed one-eyed boy who was begging her to get on the ship or climb aboard his new dragon with him. Instead she saw an entirely different person. He was sat with a large book. His newly broken voice had filled her ears he was practicing his Valyrian. His hair was just past his shoulders and Rhaella could tell he had grown significantly in their time apart surely he was taller than her now. What stuck out to her the most though was his face it had sharpened and become rather handsome most of all though a gleaming sapphire sat where his missing eye used to be.  She wasn’t sure why but she slipped away not bothering to alert him of her presence. Maybe his new appearance had startled her or hypnotized her she truly was unsure of it all.   After dinner had concluded Rhaella tried slipping away perhaps she’d visit the library the castle’s library had always been far superior to Driftmark’s.   “Are you scared of me?”   A foreign voice fills her ears just as she reaches the doors to the library.   “Aemond.” She breathes when she turns to face him his sapphire eye is now covered with a dark leather eyepatch “Were you following me?”   She did not hear any footsteps but that did not mean it was impossible.   “You did not look at me once during dinner. Nor did you visit when you arrived yesterday. You are avoiding me.” He said his voice had a twinge in it like his feelings were hurt.  When did he get so observant and bold?   “I was not avoiding you Aemond.” Rhaella said looking at him.   “Then why leave dinner so quickly you ran as tough your hair was on fire.” He jests   “You…” She decides it is best to be honest with him “You are making me nervous.”   Aemond lets out a snort of laughter.   “Why? Does my appearance frighten you?” He asks stepping closer to her so they were only an arms length away   “No! No. It is just…different. I was expecting the same boy who cried after I told him that I’d remain in Driftmark. You have grown up that is all.” She explained honestly   “As have you. You are ten and four now yes?” He asked   “Yes.” She said   It was uncanny how he was taller than her now truly unfair considering he was still younger than her.   “Aemond!”   What did she do to the gods that they were cursing her with Aegon’s presence?   “Aemond! Come the festivities are not over.” Aegon declared wrapping an arm around Aemond’s shoulders.   “Hello Aegon.” She greeted   “Yes hello.” Aegon greeted his eyes briefly scanning her up and down.   “Where are we going? Mother and father have both gone to bed.” Aemond asked confused.   “I am going to show you the world little brother” Aegon said   Rhaella thought that was a stupid sentence. It sounded like something out of a bad romance story.   “Might we bring Rhaella? I want to speak to her more.” Aemond asked   “No.” Aegon said immediately   Rhaella glared at him how dare he say where she could and could not go?   “It is for men only. You are a man now little brother or well you will be by the end of the night.” Aegon laughed “Come we’re going now.”   Rhaella watched as Aegon walked off.   “I am sure he is just taking me to some tavern he likes. It isn’t for noble ladies though.” Aemond said   “How long will you be gone?” Rhaella asked suddenly sad that he wasn’t going to stay with her.   “Not long. Wait in the library I’ll come to you when we’re done.” Aemond said before turning “I want you to tell me about the dragon you have claimed.”   Rhaella smiled as she watched Aemond race after his brother perhaps appearances had changed but he was still the boy she knew even though years had passed.   Aemond has never felt more unsure of himself. He has spent the last three years creating a person that is untouchable devoid of weaknesses and yet his hands are shaking and his mind is racing. Despite the late hour he sits in a bath that he ordered a maid to draw for him. The soap and soft rag are rubbing his skin raw as he tries to rid himself of the whore’s sickly sweet perfume.   Aegon’s laughter was ringing in his ears. The way his elder brother had laughed and pointed as her hands had run down his body. She had been soft and warm yet Aemond had not enjoyed any of it. His skin felt like it was crawling when it had ended. Why did Aegon enjoy doing that regularly? Surely acts like that were not worth dedicating entire establishments to.   His hair is sticking to his neck as he sits in the water. Perhaps if he sits here long enough he will be washed away and the memories of tonight will fall away as well. His eye squeezes shut when he recalls the way her voice had sounded in his ears loud and wonton almost like the sound of a dying animal.   Fuck. He wished he could take it all back he should’ve ignored his brother and just gone to bed then all would be right and he wouldn’t wish to peel his skin from his bones. His skin is red by the time he is done with it all. Surely he has removed the layer that her hands were all over.   He feels dizzy as he forces himself out of the comfort of the bath. He thinks of Rhaella surely she is not waiting for him still.   Once he is dressed though his legs lead him to the library anyway. Maybe he is just seeking comfort in familiarity but all he knows is for once in his life he is not alright with being alone. The library is silent and very dark when he enters. He nearly turns back to return to his own chamber when a pale flicker of light catches his eye.  A stump of a candle is all that illuminates the scene he finds her in. Her head is resting in her arms as half her body is resting on the table. Her nose is whistling ever so slightly as she sleeps. He quietly sits down next to her just her presence is enough to calm his racing mind. Her long hair is free from its usual braids and tumbles down her shoulders. It is softer than it looks as he wraps a strand around his finger. His eye examines her face that is just barely illuminated by the candle. Her features had sharpened just like his had the past three years and Aemond cannot deny that it suits her. Her familiar scent invades his nose as he rests his head on the table to stare at her he smiles as he thinks of her waking to find him next to her.  “Gevī”   Beautiful     And so we dig into the romance of the story…  Sorry if the Valyrian is wrong obviously I’m not fluent in it and I used an online translator for this story.  By the way Sōna means snow in Valyrian. ;)     Next Part   Comment below to join the taglist. (The taglist is not by chapter once added you will remain there unless you ask to be removed.)

When you stopped visiting Dragonstone she knew something was wrong but when none of the ravens she sent asking about your well-being were answered she assumed Alicent was behind it but never did she expect this. Soon as Rhaenyra returned to Dragonstone the maester asked to speak to her in private as a matter of urgency and informed her that you had arrived earlier with a babe.  Her eyes brim with tears as she gulps down “Wha—what is the child’s name?”  “Aelia she’s my daughter” you weep. “Mine and Jacaerys I’m so sorry Rhaenyra.”  You weren’t sure what you expected to happen next. Rhaenyra to let you stay? For Jace to accept his daughter and proclaim his undying love for you? And that you’d live happily ever after? It was a nice thought—more of a foolish dream—to imagine anything good would happen next.  The door to the bedchamber creaks slightly and you turn and see Prince Daemon glaring at you. He storms forward. “What did she just say?” He repeats the question when neither of you answer. “Jacaerys has a bastard with a green? No doubt another trick was orchestrated by those Hightower cunts. How do we know if the child is hers?”  You step back holding Aelia closer. More tears spill from your eyes; it hurts to know he thought of you so poorly especially since you were once so close to Rhaenyra’s small family.  “That’s enough” Rhaenyra says sternly. “Nara is nothing like that; my sister would not lie about such a thing.”  “Is that so?” he snarks only addressing his wife. “I distinctly remember the look on Prince Jacaerys face being similar to the one on yours whenever the greens toyed with you. All the years of cruelty you suffered—”  “I never meant to hurt Jace! I love him” the words blurt out of your mouth. “I—I—I never wanted any of this; you must believe me. I wish things could have been so different.”  Your elder sister’s eyes gloss over again as she watches you place the babe in the cot the master has brought to you. “What happened?”  You swallow hard; it takes all of your strength to not crumble under Daemon’s hateful gaze but you refuse to give him that power over you. “I didn’t know I was with child” you say picking at the skin surrounding your nails. “It was only when Aegon kept making comments about my weight that the queen figured it out. I wanted to tell Jace but I wasn’t allowed to leave the keep or write to him. I wasn’t allowed to see my brothers or Helaena until after I’d given birth; she kept me in complete isolation.”  “King Viserys wouldn’t have allowed that” Daemon hisses.  “My father never knew. The maester told them I had a contagious sickness. And when I gave birth…” A sharp pain shoots across your chest as you feel the weight of your mother’s betrayal crashing down making it difficult to breathe. “They…they…”  Tenderly Rhaenyra strokes at your cheek. “What on earth did they do to you my sweet?”  “They told me Aelia was dead that she died after I’d given birth. I’ve spent all this time mourning my daughter who was alive. She was being kept in the queen’s quarters the entire time.” You try to push the awful memories aside but they don’t budge causing you to sob hysterically. Rhaenyra places her hand on the back of your head gently stroking your hair in an attempt to soothe you. “The midwives who were there have been dismissed from the keep and the only other person who knows is Ser Criston. He’s the one who told me Aelia was alive.”  Daemon and Rhaenyra share an unreadable look.  “There’s still so much I need to share with you sister but…” You wipe your nose with the back of your hand. “I know I have no right to ask but may I tell Prince Jacaerys? I want to apologize for everything in person.”  “You may” Rhaenyra nods her eyes moving to Aelia who was starting to whimper. “He has taken to his bedchambers to get ready for dragon riding. If you’re quick you may catch him before he leaves. I’ll watch over Aelia for now.”  —  The look on Jacaerys face makes you feel sick; he was distraught and looked as if he might throw up. Within the space of a few minutes you’d pulled the rug out from underneath him. Not only did Jacaerys know he was a father but his daughter would be tainted with bastardy like him.  You take a deep breath. “She looks like you. Aelia she has your hair and nose.”  Jace says nothing.  You go over the side of the bed he’s sitting on and kneel in front of him trying to get him to look at you. Jace looked so happy when he first opened the door to his bedchamber and saw you standing there. “Jacaerys please say something. I’m sorry.”  “You’re sorry?” He sounds deflated. “You’ve got nothing to apologize for; you didn’t ask for this.”  “Didn’t I? I chose to have six before marriage; I brought this on myself.“ You wipe away fallen tears with the back of your hand. “You need to believe me that I wanted to leave; I wanted to be with you!”  “It’s not your fault Nara. I wrote to you every day. I tried to see you.”  “I never knew you tried to see me or sent ravens until a member of the kingsguard confessed the queen had them destroy all the ravens.”  You attempt to keep your tears at bay by squeezing your eyes shut but they fall anyway. Jace wipes them away with the pads of his thumb. “I need to speak with my mother. Try and fix this mess before it’s too late.” Seeing the look of hurt on your face Jace tried to retract what he said: “I didn’t mean it in the way that it sounded; I’m just trying to figure out how to solve this before your honor comes into question.”  “I don’t care what people say about me.”  “I do because anything said about us will pass on to Aelia.”  Hearing the pain in his voice makes you cry even harder. “You’re right I’ve just—I can’t think clearly. God only knows what Alicent has spread. I’m scared Jace; you don’t know how vicious she can be. The things that she threatened me with… I can’t forgive her.”  He goes silent for a few moments. “Where is Aelia?”  “With Princess Rhaenyra. Do you want to meet her?”  “Yes… no… I’m terrified.”  A soft smile pulls on your lips. “Let’s go then.”  —  The last few hours have been hectic. You stand in front of the black-painted table studying each of the different houses and their locations on it. A single tear rolls down your cheek. Hearing the footsteps of someone walking up behind you you turn to face them fully expecting to see Jacaerys or Rhaenyra but are surprised to see it’s Daemon. Gulping you lower your head to look at the table again.  “Uncle.”  “We need to speak.”  Oh.  “If you’ve come to call me a Hightower cunt there’s no need. I already know what you think of me and my daughter being here.”  When Jacaerys first laid eyes on your daughter he started to sob and while Rhaenyra comforted her son Daemon became enraged and demanded you take your ‘bastard’ and leave Dragonstone at once which caused him and your sister to argue.  “I used to pray to the gods nightly begging them to bring my daughter back to me and to be reunited with Jacaerys. But never did I think it would be under such circumstances.”  “The gods can give as much as they take. Where is the girl now?”  “Aelia is with Jacaerys and Princess Rhaenyra.” You turn and face the board again. “My sister has shown me more kindness than my own mother ever has.”  He scoffs and comes to stand beside you at the table. “You could have gone anywhere on Dragonback. Why did you come here?”  “I considered going to Essos but when Kain was in the sky I told him to take us home.”  “And Dragonstone feels like home to you?” He asks sarcastically.  “No but Jacaerys does.”  He rolls his eyes “that’s very touching but you have brought fucking chaos into our house. And I want to know what you’re planning to do about it?”  “I want revenge.”  “That is all very touching but you have brought fucking chaos into our home.” Daemon rolls his eyes. “And I want to know what you’re planning to do about it niece?”  “I want revenge.”,2024-07-14 00:35:13 GMT

The light bleeds into her honey eyes picking out soft kisses of green.  As Aegon waits for her to decide his eyes trail up her body.

Red striped dress cut short just past that soft curve connecting her buttocks to her thighs. It’s one of his favourite places to bite on a woman. He already knows what kind of body butter she uses. He found it in the bathroom last night and wore it on his arms after he was done showering off the vomit.

There are many justifications for this but none of them please me so this is my tribute to the dream tamer…   Previously - Index - Next  The air was dotted with stars their fire thousands of miles away illuminating the earth that burned like never before.  Fire salt tears.   Wind was nothing more than a memory.   The walls were damp red and moving like sea waves. Contracting and expanding swallowing. The water that covered her from the knees down was bright green so bright and beautiful that it made her want to cover herself completely in it but she couldn’t something in the back of her mind screams that was dangerous to play with that.   Muffled screams outside remind her that she must keep going she couldn’t stop now. She needed to climb.  The girl climbs the narrow damp walls and when she finally manages to stand the floor sinks beneath her feet. It’s fluffy lumpy and rough there are traces of the green liquid there. In front of her a narrow corridor of raw flesh stands the sides covered in ivory white stakes that come from the floor and ceiling. Hot wind passes through the gaps between the stakes but doesn’t burn her. Nothing can burn her. She’s made of dragon’s blood.   A gutural noise echoes up the hole she came out of and it contract’s again. The girl turns and stares in terror at the sight: wild fire. It climbs the hole slowly and then expands. It wasn’t green water it was wild fire. The walls open and the fire covers everything in a strong and destructive breath. The ground above her feet disappears she’s falling and when she looks up she can only see the dragon that spat her out close its mouth and fly away rocked by it’s withered wings. She screams but the dragon doesn’t comeback to save her.  Why doesn’t he come back?! She was like him her blood was fire too! Why didn’t he come back?   Her skin falls apart scattering into the air until all that remains are bones of her former self and silver hair. Warm wind embraces her in her fall. She looks up seconds before being embraced by the ground and sees the moon full like never before explode and expel a million dragons.  When the dragon’s blood finishes its fall the ground turns into ice and Celaena opens her eyes.  “The dragon…” Celaena screams sitting up in bed when he finally woke up. She was drenched in sweat her hands were shaking and her breathing was uneven.   She was used to these dreams the ones that seemed too real. When she was immersed in them she didn’t know how to get out. Celaena knew they were just dreams that nothing could hurt her body but the mind… It was her mind she was worried about.   The light emanating from the window bathed the room in a silvery glow the moon was full huge like never before just like in the dream. Its comfortable glow contrasted with the infernal heat in the room She was sweating so much that she had wet the bed sheets.  How disgusting what would they think of her? She was no longer a little girl she was already twelve years old and practically a woman. Imagine what they wouldn’t think if they thought she still wets the bed when she sleeps? No. Celaena couldn’t let the news spread. She got up and took the sheets off the bed throwing them in the fireplace so quickly that she didn’t even needed to think.   As soon as she finished cleaning the bed she looked for a new nightgown among the countless trunks that her servants had brought from Dragonstone. Celaena didn’t understand why there was a need for so much clothing since they would leave shortly after the end of the tournament still she mentally thanked the maids every time she woke up sweaty at dawn and had a clean nightgown to wear.   Outside the Red Keep the city was in an uproar the arrival of nobles from all corners of the kingdom certainly boosted local commerce and of course the festivities too. King’s Landing was the kind of city that was alive at night but Celaena’s room only had the view of the Blackwater bay that ran slowly with the soft shushes of the water. She could hear the ordinary people in the city living their lives screaming moaning laughing… she could also hear the dragons roaring in the pit and… no this roar was too close.  Celaena’s lost eyes turn to the moon through the window full like never before as if it would explode and expel thousands of dragons like in the dream the girl had just woken up from. There was a black spot in front of the moon cutting it in a smooth and slow flight. The roar of that creature echoed throughout the Red Keep like a lullaby to Celaena’s ears she knew who it was immediately.  The Dreamstealer circled the Red Keep in the air as if it were his prey his orange eyes swept the countless towers gardens gates and windows until they settled on the only thing he could recognize as his: Celaena. As soon as he saw her he changed his flight path diving towards the balcony where she was waiting for him with a huge smile on her lips.   His long wings swept the ground spreading dust and star’s as he landed messing up the little girl’s hair and nightgown. He was young so small that she was barely able to put a saddle on his back but she loved him.   He was the most beautiful dragon to be born in centuries the blue and purple scales contrasted creating an almost boreal effect never seen before. When he flew in the night sky the only thing that gave him away was his bright orange eyes that adorned his face like little suns. He was a wild dragon that hated being caged but was also extremely gentle and faithful to his owner.   “Skoriot emagon ao issare Dreamstealer?”   “Where have you been dreamstealer?”  Asked the Targaryen approaching her dragon and touching its nose. There is more in dragons than ordinary men can understand and the Targaryens understood this on a certain level their dragons might not speak but they always made it clear what they wanted and Dreamstealer wasn’t any different. He tilted his head towards Celaena’s body poking her and then pointing back to the moon.   He wanted to fly.  “Nyke kostagon daor sōvegon sir. Se istia sagon isse zaldrīzes ripo.”   “I can’t fly now. And you must be in dragon pit.”  She scolds him but can’t seem angry at all just enchanted by the beautiful creature in front of her. Celaena always found herself admiring Dreamstealer and couldn’t get used to how beautiful and unique he was the smallfolk used to say that Targaryens were closer to gods than to men and for Celaena that was true because there is no way that there is anything more divine than dragons in this whole wide world.  “Ēdā iā bantis ossȳngnon tolī?”  “Did you have a nightmare too?”  Dreamstealer grunts poking her again he wanted to fly. He didn’t need words to make it clear that he too had been disturbed by the world of dreams. Celaena’s mother told her that in her first years of life she used to spend the nights screaming in her sleep that she would be disturbed and woke up sweaty and shaking every night. These nightmares only calmed down after Daemon gave her the egg that gave birth to Dreamstealer.   The bond between them was remarkable sometimes it seemed like he was more people than dragon that he understood her like no one else could. When Celaena cried he did too when he was sick he also weakened and when she had nightmares he was also disturbed.   There were no records of such a dragon.  “Bantis zōbrie issa se ossȳngnoti lēdys yn kostā sōvegon isse lyks ñuha byka mēre. Iksan ȳgha.”   “The night is dark and full of terrors but you can fly in peace my little one. I am safe.”  With one last touch to the dragon’s forehead Celaena stepped aside to give him space as he reluctantly took flight. His long shiny wings sweeping the ground. He was like a dream but better than anything she could ever dream about.  “My lady?” the voice coming from inside the room woke her up and Celaena quickly turned her back on the balcony and returned to the room.   “Sor!” she scolded him as soon as she closed the balcony door and could look at him. She didn’t know that man he wasn’t her sworn sword sor Daren Waters. “What makes you think you can come in uninvited?”  &quot;Nothing my lady” replied the man with a cheeky smile making a short bow. “Forgive me for coming in without asking permission but I heard a noise and thought-”  “Oh no… it’s not your fault. Sor Daren should have warned you that I have these night terrors and might end up screaming.”  The soldier nodded he was gigantic and very beautiful. Celaena was used to seeing the same men every day the dragon seeds her mother took in as her wards and common people who served in Dragonstone. That soldier was different from the people she was used to he didn’t have an ordinary face neither was Valyrian. He’s features were something else men usually made Celaena afraid with their perverted eyes that found pleasure even in a child like her but his eyes were big and kind and even if she tried she couldn’t feel afraid of him. It was almost funny how respectfully he avoided looking at her body it made her want to smile.   “Oh sor Daren warned me about the screams but there was something else a-”   “A big noise like thunderstorm coming from my chambers?”   “Exactly!” he responded clicking his tongue against the roof of his mouth eliciting giggles from the young lady.   “That was my dragon sor…”  “Harwin” the nameless soldier finally introduced himself and Celaena couldn’t help but echo the name sliding it off her tongue. Harwin… “Exactly. Harwin Strong my lady. And… a dragon? What was he doing here at such a time? Shouldn’t he be in the pit?”  “He had a nightmare” replied the young lady knowing it would sound childish but with no better answer than the truth.  “A nightmare… just like you did.”  “Yes sor Harwin just like I did.”   His gentle eyes carefully analyzed the lady’s strictly serious face trying to distinguish if that was really true or if she was just trying to have a laugh at his expense.  “Impressive” he concluded after a few seconds of silence shaking his shoulders and looking around. “So there’s no threat against you in this room?”  “That depends sor are you a threat?”  “I don’t think so my lady” replied Harwin bowing again.  “Great. Thank you sor Harwin.”   “At your service my lady.”     N/A: I know this may seem confusing but my intention is to follow a POV structure similar to GOT so yes there’ll be chapters from the pov of several oc’s and maybe canon char’s.   Also again: please be kind. English is not my first language and is hard asf to translate especially because some things sound great like real poetry in my language but in English it doesn’t work. 😭 (crying in latino america)  Continue in:,2024-07-14 02:55:56 GMT

A/N: Y&#x27;all this was supposed to be funny (got to thinking more after I made this post) but I sat down and started typing and blacked out and was apparently possessed by the spirit of GRRM because… this is not funny. A version of Aemond lives in my mind that actually mellows with age but it is not this Aemond. Warnings: Non-graphic deaths mention of suicide depression  Aegon didn’t deserve to be king. Aegon didn’t deserve a lot of things.  Aegon is already dead.  That’s what he tells himself when he finds them. Sunfyre is dying—Vhagar could fly him back to the Dragonpit but why? He’ll be dead in a month anyway.  Sunfyre is dying. Aegon is already dead.  They had been friends once hadn’t they? If they had he can’t remember.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; He remembers a pig with wings Aegon cackling with glee as he drags Aemond through the streets on his name day the disgust in his eyes whenever someone showed Aemond any special attention an egg that never hatched.  No they had never been friends. Not even as children. Certainly not now.  Aegon is already dead.  “Dracarys” he says.  Someone shouts behind him; he barely hears it over the roar of Vhagar’s breath as she incinerates Sunfyre and Aegon.  “Aegon was already dead” he whispers over the screams of the dying dragon.  Cole is shouting screaming. “What the hell happened?”  “Sunfyre would never have survived.”  “But the king—!”  “The king is dead.”  ~~~  Daeron crowns him.  The crown sits heavy on his brow heavy they say so he who wears it never forgets the weight of his responsibility.  Well.  His shoulders are strong.  ~~~  King Aemond Targaryen is not beloved by the small folk. He is not the Realm’s Delight not the Brave not he Conciliator not even the Queen Who Never Was.  He is the Kinslayer and the Kingkiller but that will be enough.  No one laughs at him now.  ~~~  Helaena falls farther into grief and madness and he can do nothing for her. He and Daeron and Cole lead the army and though they are outnumbered by Rhaenyra’s dragons he has Vhagar and one by one they fall.  It does not matter that he is winning. Not to those around him.  All the small council worries about is who will inherit the throne what marriage will provide the best alliance.  All Alicent says is “Aemond you must take a wife produce an heir—”  But he doesn’t want a wife he doesn’t need a wife he needs an heir.  He has an heir.  He has Jaehaera.  Jaehaera who walks to small council meetings with him who clambers up the steps of the throne to sit on his knee while he hears petitions who sings to Morghul and Helaena and the cats who replaced the ratcatchers after Aegon hanged them all.  ~~~  “Jaehaera” he says quietly leaning forward as he sits cross-legged in front of her playing with the little wooden dragons.  She tilts her head beaming at him.  “Jaehaera I am proud of you. You are a brave girl and beloved by all and you make your family proud. When I die you will be queen.”  She frowns like she can’t imagine a world in which he could die.  He could. He imagines that world every day.  “And until then I will teach you everything I know.”  So he does. He teaches her to fly to speak High Valyrian to fight with a sword and a spear and her words sharp as steel even as her heart is soft.  ~~~  He looks to Helaena and she knows she knows what he did. She knows the sounds of the screams he hears in the small hours of the night.  ~~~  King Aemond Targaryen is not beloved by the small folk.  And if whispers of Maegor follow him around what does he care? Maegor had been king had he not?  And he is not cruel—he will never be cruel—but he does rule. He is the king after all.  ~~~  King Aemond is beloved by the army. They will follow where he leads cheering Vhagar’s shadow and Blackfyre’s flash.  Cole however cannot be trusted. He watches too closely. He schemed without Aegon when he was king he is like to scheme without Aemond now.  Cole dies in an ambush and new generals rise up to take his place.  ~~~  He looks to Alicent to Otto to Daeron. They incline their heads. “Your Grace” they call him even as they tell him what to do.  “Marry” Otto tells him. “Forge an alliance.”  “Sire heirs” Alicent tells him. “Strengthen your claim and your line.”  “Remember your betrothed” Daeron winks. “I hear she yet draws breath.”  He doesn’t want Floris Baratheon. He doesn’t want any of them.  He wanted Lucerys alive and locked in a dungeon somewhere he wanted Helaena to be safe and happy he wanted Daemon to admit he was afraid of him.  He wants now to marry Daeron off to the daughter of the first lord that comes asking. Let him have Floris Baratheon if she still draws breath. Let him forge an alliance and sire children but let him also be gone.  ~~~  They eye the throne all of them.  They wait for the day Aemond falls in battle so they may put another puppet on the throne just as they did when Viserys died.  Aemond does not fall.  He watches Otto live out his years many of them before the old man simply does not wake one morning.  Daemon and Jacaerys die above Harrenhal and Vhagar roars her victory to the Riverlands.  Helaena’s grief eats at her a cancerous growth born of Jaehaerys’s murder and fed by every deed since. She pitches herself from the window of her room. Dreamfyre is a formidable fighter but she will not go to battle without a rider.  Aemond and Daeron fly alone.  Rhaena disappears; Baela betrays Rhaenyra; the wild dragons and the riderless dragons fall to the small folk and when the people of King’s Landing storm the Dragonpit and kill every dragon there Aemond is over Dragonstone killing Syrax and Rhaenyra.  The war—his war—takes them all. There are no dragons left but Vhagar no Targaryens left but him and the girl who watches him with such wide eyes.  The Last Dragon they call him to his face. To his back he is the Mad Dragon as the years wear on but the Keep has ears and the Dragon knows.  No one laughs at him. Not for a long time now.  ~~~  Her mother is dead and his mother is dead and there is no one left and he cries as he sits on the Iron Throne in the small hours of the night.  Sometimes Jaehaera comes down barefoot from her room and sits at the foot of the throne and stares at him a thousand years of heartbreak in her eyes and he stares back.  Whose eye stares from the socket he wonders. Can he even lay claim to it anymore? Is it Lucerys’s? Does his niece see Daemon looking back at her?  She looks like Helaena but sometimes Aegon and sometimes Viserys but mostly he sees Rhaenyra when he looks at her and someday he will die and all this will be done and he wonders what would have happened had he never been born had his egg hatched had Aegon lived had he sided with the Blacks to spite Aegon had he forgiven Lucerys.  He will always wonder and so will they.,2024-07-14 02:28:08 GMT

Aegon is stupid but the show doesn’t fall behind in showing Rhaenyra isn’t smart at all and her council is falling apart because she show not have authority.

ALSO i havent watched the dinner scene in 2 years and i cannot find it on the sites so excuse any unorthodoxy. ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE im also dyslexic :)    !!!!! this was heavil inspired by the lovely @myladysapphire ’s fic “seduction” which you should go read warnings: some gaslighting dry humping fingering heavy petting making out intoxication        the birth of a child is a joyus occasion for any ordinary family for the royal house targaryen … not always.   it was a sunny summer day when the queen alicent went into labour the sun shined its golden rays upon the keep making its redstone material even more beautifull. while the festivities of the tourney in the babes honor roared outside the noise and cheers and laughter penetrated the keeps walls filling the rooms with the joy of the celebration. all rooms but one.   alicent screamed and whrithed with the unimaginable pain of labour. viserys walked up the stairs with a newfound excitement yet as he reached the door of his wifes rooms he stopped. the weight of his pursuit of an heir the one than killed his first wife hit him like an angry wave. cold sweat ran across his forhead. no his beloved aemmas life was not in vain rhaenyra would sit the throne he rationalized. straightening his posture he oppened the door.   every minute felt like eons for viserys. by the grace of the gods the babe arrived quickly. “a son your grace” said the maester. music to viserys ears. a midwife handed him the swaddled babe. “welcome to the family aegon&quot;said the king. enamoured by his son it took a second before he heard his wife groaning again. &quot;another babe !” exclaimed the maester. “another blessing” chimed in the midwife. and thus a girl was born.  that was how the princess came into the world. a little surprise for her family. a little unwanted surprise.  as the princess grew up that was the word that defined her existance unwanted. not abusedno but she was not the first boy not the heir not even the spare. just another girl.   she came to understand her position very well quiet and demure refusing to cause any fuss around her existance for no one else did.   especially not her older sister rhaenyra. despite the little girls admiration for her rhaenyra never spared her a second glance.she did not mistreat her younger sister by any means just too busy being heir and having children of her own. she had no time for a child that was unwanted in the first place.   Her father on the other hand downright ignored her. the excitement of having a son consumed him in those first years after their birth. there was no love left for her. soon even that ran out and it was as if her and her brother never existed.  it did not matter though she found solace in her other family. the queen alicent loved her daughter dearly not absolved of ignoring her at times in favour of her brother but it was ok she did far more than any other. attached by the hip to aegonthey did everyting together it was only natural the realm viewed her as nothing but an extension of him anyway.   by the time her twelfth nameday came to be it was widely accepted she would be married to her twin. though young she understood the implications of such a proposal. aegon her fathers long awaited male heir would be king and she his queen. the idea rooted in her mind. queen of the realm. the most influential woman of the seven kingdoms. it rooted and festered untill her rambition consumed her everymost descision. to her it was only fair. all the attention she was denyed in her childhood would be atoned for. she would finaly get what she deserved.  the gods had other plans though. more like otto hightower had other plans. rhaenyra proposed a betrothal between helaena alicents secondborn and jacaerys her firstborn. to alicent it was an insult one that had to be prevented by any means.   it was not difficult for otto to get the king to agree to marry helaena and aegon instead. to the king it made no difference the affairs of his daughters whose name were not rhaenyra did not matter.   :readmore:        the news reached the princess on her way to driftmark for her aunt laenas funeral. ser otto hightower upon the queens incistance was tasked with breaking the news.   “that is not fair!” she shouted toward her grandsire franticaly moving around her erratic movements exaderated by those of the ship. “oh hush child you know better than anyone nothing is promised in this life” he responded calm collected slightly irritated.   “but i heard it mother and lord larys saying the marrige would sway the kind toward changing the succesion”. Suddently otto rose from his seat. the princess was throwing a tantrum a dangerous one. if word were to reach the king about their scheming to strip rhaenyra of her heritage it could cost both his and his daughters heads. “now how did you hear such a thing?”. the air had shifted the calmnes in his voice replaced by more irritation and something new. fear perhaps ?  “it… it matters not how i came upon the information it matters that i now know. so please explain to me why i ought to be cast aside in this way. i am a princess !”  “so is your sister. you love your sister do you not?” “i do… but i was promided something and i plan to see it realised” diplomatic words for a child otto thought.   “it does not matter though does it ? you understand rhaenyra is heir yes ?” she nodded. “and your goal as i understand is to be queen yes ?” he had now moved from where he was standing and was sitting next to her on the sette. she nodded again.   “you know of the favouritism your father shows rhaenyra as he sees it she is his only child therefore his only heir”   “but-but father wanted a son he should be the heir” startled by ottos movements her initial anger turned to silent disapointment her little face pouting. “do not go around running your mouth saying such things” he responded hurriedly “you may be a princess but your neck is in as much danger as anyones” he turned to look into her eyes  “we understand the way things are your father however is blinded by his grief. aegon is not heir his wife will not be queen. you would not acquire the power you seek either way.”  “i understand…”.   Satisfied with himself for having stiffled his granddaughters tantrum he turned away once again. “now you are free to take a husband of your choise to seek love is that not what all young maidens dream of ?” her pouting face remained. “love is nothing in the absence of power” otto chuckled if only his daughter had shared that same mindset. the dragon was more hightower than he thought. “in what book did you read that now”.   Before she could answer a knock sounded at the door. the queen entered sir criston in toe. “we are to dock soon return to your siblings at once little one” said alicent somewhat taken aback by the sight of her dughter and father side by side. “yes your grace” said the little girl before quickly exiting.  alicent turned to her father. “i trust you were not corrupting her with any of your sheming” she stated matter-of-factly. “trust me daughter i did not need to… be more careful when speaking with the small council from now on the walls have eyes in the red keep”     after docking the little princess was going through the motions of royal protocol as if possesed certainly lacking the sort of queenly air shed carried herself with up untill that point. it no longer mattered. her dreams were shattered all she ever wanted all she ever hoped for gone in a single boat trip.   vaemond spoke yet none of his words reached her. she looked to her sister rhaenyra from across the procession. the vision of a queen long silver hair braided in the fashions of the queen rhaenys. hugging her children close to her arms arms meant to hold her.   no matter how much she attempted to push these feelings down to pretend her sisters indifference hurt now more than ever. the longer she studied rhaenyra and the longer rhaenyra refused to spare her a single glance she got more and more depressed. so much so she did not notice a pair of big brown eyes next to rhaenyra staring right at her.   after the procession was completed the guests started mingling lords discussing deals families exchanging condolances and such. as a princess of the realm she was excpected to offer her condolances to the family of the deceased she walked forth to greet her cousins baela and rhaena the dragon twins. normally it would be a chance to excersise her queenly grace now it was but another motion. “im sorry for your mother my condolances.” she spat out. “thank you cousin” replied baela. rhaena was solemn only looking at her shoes. her nephews standing next to her she could not care less.   having fulfilled her duty she left without a word. no one would pay attention to the thorn of house targaryen anyway. and none did. except for those same brown eyes from earlier.   as she walked further and further away from the crowd she was greeted by the salty driftmark air. the rough cliffs and architecture were opposite of the red keeps. but it was a welcome change the red keep was a place of lies and dissapointment.  eventually she reached a small nook amongs the salty castle walls. finally some respite. she sat on the ground and took a deep breath.silence. yet peace did not last long. soon footsteps sounded coming toward her untill they stopped.  she looked up. a young boy of dark eyes and darker hair. jacerys velaryon. the firstborn of her firstborn sister. his features struck her even more from up close. she knew the rumors. alicent spoke of them constantly when she thought she was not listening. she may have perpatuated some of them herself on those bad days her sisters rejection particularly stung. she never thought of jacerys never spoke to him as far as she was concerned he was only an extension of her sister.  “what do you want ?” she spat courtly. “i dunno&quot;replied jacaerys.  &quot;its your aunts funeral you should be with your mother and siblings” “dont want to.”   cautiously he sat next to her. they stayed there a while siletly staring at the wild waves ahead. it was…strangely comfortable. jacerys was born a few years after her and despite their both growing up in the red keep togerher they rarely spoke. he knew nothing of his familys distaste for her a stranger to the sins surrounding her name ther girl doubted his mother spoke of her. to him she was practicaly a stranger.   after a while sitting in this comfortable silence he dared speak up. “should we head back ?”. “you should i doubt anyone noted my absence”   “why ?” his voice rung with something unfamiliar to her something akin to…concern. “you cannot note the absence of something you took no notice of in the first place” replied she solemnly. the emotion in her voice surprised even herself something about this boy moved her. the princess did not like it. “i took notice i mean i followed you here” she felt his eyes on the side of her face yet did not dare return his gaze. “…thank you jacerys. why did you follow me ?”  “i thought you looked lonely” if shed turned her head sideways the princess would note him blushing. the comfortable silence returned.      prince jacerys knew not of this feeling bubbling in his chest. he had noticed his aunt during the funeral. he always took notice of her. walking around the keep catching glimpses of her in the library after finishing her studies. his favourite part of training was gazing upon her form framed by helaenas window the yard had a perfect view. he always noticed her always saw her even when she looked elswere. his mother never bothered formally introducing them rarely ever spoke of her. neither did his grandsire. he never went out of his way to greet her either out of fear or nerves he did not know.   today was his window of opportunity. rhaenyra had sent him to comfort his cousins yet he could not take his mind off of his aunt. when she came and greeted baela walking away right after it was perfect. quickly he dismissed himself and slipped away from everyone. the vision of her walking the tumoltous balconies of driftmark silver hair blowing in the wind she looked like a vision calling him to her side. and now here he was.   neither of them knew how long they sat like that. they only knew of the feelings flowing between them. a strange sense of comfort. eventually though they had to return. she stood up first. “come on we must head back your mother is worried about you”  heading back they were greeted by no rhaenyra and no daemon. before jacerys could speak a word to the princess she vanished. he joined his cousins once again they spoke to him yet he heard none of it silently staring at the direction she dissapeared.      the princess awoke the next morning having slept soundly that night a certain strong face haunting her dreams. she arose from her bed and went to call for her handmaidens yet stepping outside the room no guard was present confused and still foggy from sleep she put on a robe and began walking toward her good-sister helaenas room not far from her own. stepping inside she found her sister blankly staring out of the window not unusual for helaena. what was unusual was her complete unacnoledgment of her. cautiously she approached the window. “helaena sister what has happened ?” “he closed an eye..” her sister was always a bit odd most brushed her strange words off but the princess understood the importance of her strange visions   “helaena please speak it to me plainly who closed an eye ?” helaena tore her gaze from the scenery outside vast uneasy brown eyes staring into her sisters   “aemond claimed vhagar late last night lucerys took his eye in return”        years passed since that fateful night in driftmark. the night the house of the dragon official split in two. the two factions came to be known as the greens and the blacks.   she had grown childhood long gone -if it ever existed- now matured into a young woman. what never left was her feelings of betrayal. aegon and helaenas wedding took place not long after driftmark and though she loved her sister deeply jealousy ran deep. helaena was a fool who was handed an opportunity she could not comprehend. it took her some time to get over that day but she did she had to.  despite ottos words on the boat she knew better. after driftmark the greens scheming became more obvious. though she wasnt privy to all information she knew their plans. stupid stupid otto hightower. he told her it did not matter he told her all the things she wanted to hear needed to hear. she hated herself for falling for his honeyed words. she was only a girl of two and ten but still. she ought to have known better. maybe if she had put more pressure onto alicent she would have won. her resentment grew into a monster wild and untameable feeding on her want for the throne.   there was one other consequence of that day she never got to see jacerys again. she never thought it would bother her before but it did. that day the words he spoke to her his tone the genuine concern laced in every sentance haunted her dreams. she dared not think about him while awake fearful of what conclusions she may reach.   fate is funny in its ways. the uncertain parentage of rhaenyras children officialy came into question.   her sisters reckless behaviour came to bite her in the rear the spoiled firstborn finally was to get a taste of consequences. not only that the petitions for driftmark would require the entire family be presentincluding jacerys. not that she cared no.      the view of dragons and ships approaching kings landing was perfect from the princesses window. syrax and caraxes landed near the dock soon the family ship followed. the rest of the way they made by carrige. the lack of reception for the heir and her husband was the princesses own idea. a small revenge.   she dared not venture to the courtyard for she knew her nephews would be there. waiting instead to face them officially in the throne room.   not many are privy to the red keeps secret passageways she was one of the lucky few. in order to avoid the courtyard she followed one such secret hall to cut through the godswood and immedietly into the throne room.   fate as stated before is very humorous.walking through the godswood she was greeted by her most favourite guest rhaenyra. as her sister stood in the courtyard for the first time in her life the princess saw her for what she was a scared mother a woman who knew she had a mess of her own making to clean up. there was no need for approval from such a pathetic creature.   “sister” greeted the young princess. rhaenyra turned to face her. “ah dear sister how are you fairing ?” dear wow the gaul  “i am…well it is nice of you to ask even if for the first time.” the sarcasm did not go unnoticed by rhaenyra. “times change sweet sister attitudes are as moveable as the tides especially within family” the tone those words were spoken in dripped with false sweetness if it were another day she would have lapped it up not today. today she understood they came not from a genuine place but from a need of support.  “when family comes into question the tides of opportunity roar i see” surprised by her sisters words rhaenyra stepped closer.  “i fear the circumstances of our reunion of my arrival are unfortunate that does not mean we need be hostile to eachother” the younger scoffed  “the only times we reunite are under unfortunate circumatsnces. last we spoke i cannot remember i actually cannot recall a time you struck up a conversation with me. only now concerned with your sons succesion when you require my help we speak”   rhaenyra was surprised more surprised than shed been in her life. she thought her relationship with her sister was what it had to be what was required the rift between their family was much vaster than shed realised.  “i am sorry for any pain i have caused you please let us discuss this in a manner befiting of family i promise i am not what these people have told you” she reached for her sisters hand immedietly the younger pulled away.  “these people are my family more my family than you have ever been. do not worry sister i would not concern you with anything beneath what befits you. we need only talk if it concerns the crown.please do not pretend to care for me as family again ypur idifference hurts but false concern is a pain i cannot manage” rhaenyra opened her mouth to speak but could not find the words.   “goodbye dear sister. i look forward to hearing your petition.” and with those words she left fighting the urge to turn back and look at the face of the one who hurt her the most every step of the way.      jacaerys stepped off the carrige and into the ground of the red keep with a goal to see his aunt again. he had grown into a capable and gracious young man in their time apart. she haunted his thoughts and steps toward adulthood in a way he could not describe. it was not love he atleast did not think so more like a strange hunger to see her again.  it scared him to think about. why was this longing so deeply rooted in his chest ?  with lucerys by his side they stepped forward into the familiar courtyard. immediently he gazed upon that same window he knew he may catch a glipse of her in. yet no one was there. it was silly to think someone would. why was his mind like this ?  lucerys must have noticed his wandering glances nudging his side. “what ?” replied jacaerys. “are you ill brother ?”. he had never spoken a word to anyone not about that day in driftmark the events of that night far too heavy to bring upcertainly not of his confusing feelings for the princess.   “im fine lucerys are you feeling well ? it is a difficult day we have ahead of us for you most of all” “im fine.”  he was not fine but it was best not to press on. lucerys had to deal with his emotions on his ownas did he.  the throne room had not changed since last he visited. he and his family stood on one side while the other slowly filled with hightowers and green supporters.   suddently there she was.  the princess targaryen. her blueish green gown only exagerated her beautyful fratures long silver hair shining adorned by intricate braids and golden jewlery. she looked like she hung the sun in the sky. his eyes were trained on her form not moving an inch commiting every detail to memory afraid shed disapear again and take the light with her. and then against all odds she returned his gaze.   it was like seeing the deep blue waves of the ocean again after years in the desert. jacerys vlaryon in all his glory. looking back at her. she dared not tear her eyes away from his familiar brown ones. they stood there surrounded by people yet alone locked in time.  eventually otto hightower announced the start of the pettitions and jacerys had to tear his gaze away. it was not a bad thing though it allowed the princess to study his features more closely. despite his dark brown locks and eyes there was something uniquely targaryen about the boy fair skin and aqualine valyrian nose betraying his heritage. he looked like the carbon of his mother. it scared her it scared her because his resemblance did not deter her emotions at all if anything it made her heart soften toward her sister. no man should hold such power over her.   the petitions went on and on but she heard few words far and in betweeneyes focused on her nephew. periodicaly he returned her gaze studying her with equal intensity alternating between commiting her to memory and comforting his brother.   for the fist time in her life she allowed herself to think of him in detail. she imagined how he would look speaking to her hearing his voice changed by the years matured deep rich manly. she though of his and when she tired she thought of them together. strolling through the gardens flying on their dragons sitting together… waking up next to him walking the altar toward him.  and for the fist time it hit her.   all these years and yet her father had not changed his mind about the succesion once. not once did his resolve to put rhaenyra on the throne falter. aegon would never be king helaena never queen so long as the current kings will persevered. but it did not have to signal the end of her queenly ambition. jacaerys was rhaenyras firstborn her first son and therefore heir. as far as the princess knew he was unmarried and yet to be betrothed to anyone.   the window of opportunity so violently closed by otto on their was to driftmark suddently was wide open again. she could marry jacaerys and finally be queen finally get what she wanted. ofcourse it would mean she would have to support her sister. every end had its means. so be it.   making up with her sister would be difficult yet something about their conversation earlier told her it might not be impossible. the answer to her ambitions was infront of her all these years jacaerys was the key.   euphoria filled her limbs making her mind hazy. floating on a bed of feathers gears already turning in her mind paving the path that would lead her to jacarys. but good things never last.   princess rhaenys was speaking her peace when suddently   “the princess rhaenyra has informed me of her intentions to wed her son jacaerys and lucerys to my granddaughters baela and rhaena a proposad to which i wholeheartedly agree.”     what. what. jacaerys and … baela. she looked upon the ceiling of the throne room as if seeking the heavens vying for the attention of the seven whty did fate punish her so ?. ofcourse why would she get what she wanted ?   she looked toward baela a look of confidence and satisfaction gracing her features eyes trained on jacaerys. she dared not look at him she wanted not to know how he felt of this arrangement.  did he know ? had he agreed to it beforehand ? she could have sworn those looks he gave her earlier meant something. but this was now more than just her feeling toward him. this was about her gtting what she wanted getting her throne.  jacaerys and baela ? no that would not do. she was no longer that wide eyed girl easily dettered by words of her elders easily manipulated into complying with others wishes. one betrothal was torn away from her not again. she would wed jacaerys she decited then and there using any means necessary.      jacaerys heard his grandmothers words the same as his aunt. he was somewhat aware of their plans to betroth him to baela but hearing them actually hearing them spoken in the presance of the king it was another thing entirely.   he briefly looked to baela. she seemed very content with the arrangemend. the same could not be said about him. his aunt had been the sole person to hold his affections thus far. as much affection as a stranger across the bay could atleast.   why was he so dissapointed ? was he even dissapointed ? did he really think there was any merrit to his feelings for the princess ? they shared one conversation all those years ago. whereas he and baela had a solid relatioship a friendship one that could be built upon. hed thought about the betrothal in the past he could find some semblances of feeling in his heart for his cousin.  yet everytime hed thought of baela another crossed his mind.   no that would not do. his aunt was beautifull yes maybe it was just that her beauty that bewitched him the air of mystery around her. it was pointless to assign any meaning to it he descited. he was a prince of the realm. he would preform his duty to baela and to his mother as best he could. childish fancy would have to be put to sleep.  a targaryen event without atleast one murder is considered a dull afair. thankfully they had daemon to provide entertainment.   the king had once again shamelessly supported his firstborn. for a rotting corpse he sure was determined. the death of vaemond velarion signaled the end of the pettitions. lucerys would inherit driftmark along with his cousin rhaena.  rhaenyra would inherit the throne and in turn jacarys along with baela. not if she had a say.  with the first lord to step foot outside of the throne room her plan was set into motion. the alegiance between the blacks and the velaryons was strong but not unbreakable. her sister was an honorable woman a good mother but a less than conscious politician. logic and aliances would not sway her love however would.      the princess knew rhaenyra would reside in her chambers untill the family dinner planned for that night. a little snooping more like a little talk with her ladies maid told her daemon would join his old friends in the gold cloaks for the afternoon. after their talk the princess and her handmaiden were to each take their leave. “oh alia i requre your help with one more thing” the maid turned “anything for you m&#x27;lady”   “i need you to place a rumor..”     with no warning no knock the young princess stepped into her sisters chambers. to say rhaenyra was surprised was an understatement.   “sister what- what brings you here ?” the younger stepped further into the room. “i understand our talk earlier was not to your liking” she began looking to her sisters eyes graced by an unreadable excpression.   “well you made your wishes clear i thought you would not wish to see me unless it was necessary. it gladens me you here though please take a seat” ever so polite. the sisters sat across from eachother on the chambers table for the first time together of their own volition.  “do not misunderstand me i would not have come here unless it was of the utmost urgency. as it stands matters of the crown plague me” rhaenyra looked concerned what matters could the crown possibly have than were not directly concerning her ?  rhaenyra remained quiet waiting to for the younger to show her hand before she revealed hers. “i heard today the proposal you offered princess rhaenys to be frank it is foolish.” rhaenyra was yet to understand the road her sister was going down on she remained quiet.   “keeping aliances strong is of upmost importance if you wish to secure your claim however quality cannot completely trump quantity…”  “what are you saying sister ?” sister finallywithout the dear bold. yet the younger remained quiet pouring herself a cup of the wine placed upon the table. she was bold but her plan bolder it required taming of the nerves. the longer the silence stretched on the uneasier the elder became.  “what do you want ?’ asked rhaenyra finally.   &quot;i want what you want what we all want” rhaenyra understood finally.   “you wish to sit the iron throne then ? is it the reason behind your questioning my alliances ?” she grew irritated of the youngers antics tired of the years being used soely for her birthright her confusion twisting now into anger.  “you would think so but no” she took a big swig of her wine “i want a family my family united. you saw the lords today you saw my grandsire. you may think fathers support is sufficient but he will to be around for long. there will come a time sooner than latter when you will be without your biggest ally and the house of the dragon will be torn apart once and for all”  rhaenyra shook her head “i am the rightfull heir the lords of the realm know who they swore an oath to. i have no need of you false concern.”   “attitides are as moveable as the tides the lords will rally behind whomever they believe benefits them most oaths be damned. our family will be in shambles you must prevent that we must prevent that” she moved now a mix of wine and sudden confidence moving her legs from her initial seat to the one next to her sister.   “wed me to jacaerys” rhaenyras confusion returned. she poured herself a cup and downed it in one go. “and why would i do that ? your void threats ?” “i can support you and your efforts best. rhaenyra looked toward the fireplace turning her body opposite of her sisters. &quot;moonfyre is a formidable dragon and my mother may yet be swayed if we work together”  “i tried once to ally myself with the green counsil they refused. besides  it will be an insult to the house velaryon an insult to my daughter.”   “i am not the green counsil i am your sister.” mirroring rhaenyras earlier movements in the godswood she took her sisters hands into hers. only unlike earlier her sister did not move. “i know you have cast me aside since i first came into the world. yet as a girl i wished every night with every prayer for you to see me finally see me.” rhaenyras eyes as if possesed found her own. an understanding started to bloom.  “i have longed to be by both you and jacaerys from afar all these years let us not be enemies do justice by our targaryen name. if not for an aliance for all you feel toward me as you sister. i have thought of everything you need only say yes.”   rhanyra ture her gaze and hands away once again pouring them both another cup of wine hoping her eyes would not betray her inner conflict. the sisters took their respective cups drinking in silence.   “i knew not of these.. feelings you describe and for that im sorry.” rhaenyra dared speak up. “i cannot give you the yes you seek but if truly your plans are as solid as you describe them i have no way of stopping you” not a victory but not a defeat. “thank you dear sister”   rumors have a way of spreading in the red keep. a phenomenon unlike any other. you could take your carridge for a visit to the great sept a maiden and return a whore. what a sinnfull and dishonorable thing. but what a usefull one to those who know to utilise it.      the queen alicent was enjoying a quiet evening after the very eventfull petitions. helaena on her left embroidering a spider on one of the childrens tunics said children on the floor playing with their toys and her reading “seven histories of seven prayers” all was at peace.   alicent finished her book and made a moved to acqure another the library was near she could go and be back in less than a feather sweep. excusing herself from the company of her family she moved to do just that. the halls of the keep were never to the queens liking much prefering those of her home alas she navigated them low sound of chatter radiating off of each room. gossiping was a sin one the queen refused to indulge in but the day had other plans.  passing through her eldest daughters chambers she caught wind of words that shocked her. cautiously she moved closer to the door hoping her ears were playing tricks.   “i mean can you believe it ? what a sandal our princess and rhaenyras son ? oh the insult” said one of her daughters ladysmaids “alia i am yet to understand how could our lady fraternise with that family they have not seen them in years” replied another “im not saying now maya back then at driftmark”  “i heard it was the reason for the princes fight prince aemond attacked jacarys for dishonoring his sister thats how he lost his eye” replied another.   “and what of todays betrothal ? the queen would never allow such dishonor befall her daughter” “thats the fun part maya the queen knows none of it as for the princess baela she has recently received proposals from the north house tully and house stark however princess rhaenyra forced her hand to prevent herself allying with the greens” replied the voice of alia.  “i believe none of it how could you come upon such information ?&quot;replied the unnamed voice again &quot;the cook told me he overheard an exchange between the young prince and his betrothed..”  the queen stepped back her breathing laboured. they were way off mark for driftmark that was certain. but what if there was truth behind their words ? it would not be unheard of. most rumors around the keep stemmed from some truth   still the queen had faith in her daughter. aegon was a rake sure but he inherited all of the rebelion in the woumb her daughter was as pure as freshly fallen snow. seeking lord larys council would be an option but the queen feared what he would ask for in return. no. she was no fool she would seek for herself the truth.        the dinner was an idiotic idea. alas the head that defies the king does not stay attatched to its body for long. the young princess sat at the head of the table along with aemond already nursing her third cup of wine. it burned going down but not more than her mothers gaze did. she knew.   her mothers gaze threatened to melt her face off but it was not what hurt most. jacaerys and baela sat next to eachother exchanging laughs and pleasantries. if the wine did not cause her to vomit they would. just a little bit longer a little more patience she would get jacaerys and the throne and baela the door.   the night went on oddly calmly. until the speeches began.   king viserrys took the lead. “we have a cause of celebration it seems. jace and luke will be married to their cousinsbaela and rhaena further strengthening the bond between our houses”  if the princesses eyes rolled any further back into her head she would see her brain. she looked to jacaerys his eyes on her only to immedietly be torn away once she looked back.   the king continued with his heartfelt speech somewhere among the words of uniting the house of the dragon rhaenyra and her sister locked eyes the understanding between them having bloomed into a garden. her fathers worlds were certainly the missing piece to convincing rhaenyra of the betrothal.   rhaenyra took her turn followed by alicent heartfelt words betraying the affections the two still shared. jacaerys was next. despite him talking about aegon and aemond his eyes fell on her periodically never too long though. as if looking at her too long would turn him to stone. his fear was evident but was it brought about by alicents menacing stare or …. his own emotions ?   it was better not to mangle matters of the heart with those of the crown she had to remind herself despite her chest thumping with every glance. helaena gave her speech toasting the happy couple yet again. her words on marrige brought about a sense of uneasines to everyone. rhaena bless her heart made an attempt to mend the situation “it leaves you cousin. have you any suitors ?”.  rhaenyra tensed alicent even more so but most of all jacaerys. his stiffness caused baelas concern who nudged him lightly. her movement laboured no reaction from the prince she turned instead to find the object of his gaze none other than his aunt.   “n-no not of yet im afraid…” she gave her best semblance of a calm reply. rhaenyra feeling bad and still mindfull of their earlier conversations took the liberty of replying “it is best not to worry about these things you may yet find your affection in unlikely places”  alicent gave a blank stare she moved her mouth to speak but was interrupted by none other than daemon. “best not to wait though my dear a young lady may fall to her charms only for so long…” his words earned him hateful looks and one of firm diaproval from his wife. his eyes however gleamed playfully ever the provocatour. daemon knew.  she could not hold back her emotions if she wanted. opting to give a small sad smile for an answer would surely betray her tears. she looked to jacaerys. this time his eyes unapologeticaly on her looking to her form with raw pitty. helaena took her hand and aemond gave her a small pat on the arm. alicents anger was on the brink of overflowing.   before the queens wrath could be unleashed upon demon the king groaned in pain immedietly he was escorted away by the guards. the family was left in shambles once again. yet the evening was far from over. rhaenyra ordered for music to be played more courses arriving at the table. the princess cared for none of it the plan was working yet daemons words stung all the same.  a hand appeared next to her asking to dance. looking up to find the owner she found none other than jacaerys velaryon. she stood up quickly ignoring her mothers gaze taking it into hers.   the unwanted child of house targaryen she was unused to being shown attention most of all the sole attention of her beloved. a familiar melody sounded in the backround years of observing others on the dancefloor yet never joining left her entirely unprepared for the dance that was to come. jacaerys noticed her nerves.   “do you know the stepps ?” she shook her head no. the reaction brought a smile to his face genuine and warm. “not to worry it is not a difficult one you only need a capable lead”  arriving finally to the dancefloor the music picked up. jacaerys hands led her to stand infront of him. since he noticed her uneasined his eyes had not left hers once.   he began the dance jumping left and right she soon joined his pace. it felt like ascending the skies on her dragon for the first time each little jump leading her further and furhter away from the ground away from the drama of her house and into the heavens.   his pace changed stepping forth to take her hand into his. the toutch was electrifying gentle yet firm he brought their joined hands to eye level gaze forever steady on her form like the eternal rocks beneath the tumoltous sea somewhat grounding her. they began to turn around eachother. slowly at first he began to hasten his turns having now to hold on tighter keeping eachother in orbit.   jace took a step back moving their joint limbs above her head intending to spin her around herself his other hand gently on her waist as to keep her steady. the wine was taking effect for before she could turn to face him again she stumbled slightly falling forward straight into his arms.   he did not let her fall however the hand on her waist immedietly snaking around her fully the one above her head going to hold the side of her face preventing it from coliding with his. by the time she gained her balance the position between them was highly innapropriate. the warmth of his hand on her cheeck made all skin receptors go haywire. his lips had slightly parted and she could feel his breath on her own if she leaned a little forward she could even….  “THAT IS ENOUGH !” queen alicents booming voice sounded. their moment of tenderness so rudely interrupted the princess pulled away from her nephew he complied taking a half-step back his hand previously on her waist however moved to hold hers once again.   “ do you take me for a fool ? sharing words of support and love to my family while your son has corrupted my sweet daughter laughing now in our faces i will have it no longer !”  everyone was shocked rhaenyra held onto her husband who moved to stand up aegon and aemond shared a look equal parts amusement and comradery while rhaena and lucerys held hands. the only one to keep his composure was the queens father. ooto knew. baelas legs were bouncing up and down furiously. everyone was in dissaray.   “what are you implying your grace ?&quot;sounded daemon full of rage and malice. &quot;i am implying nothing i am up and stating it since your family is playing the fool. your son has corrupted my daughter tainted her virtue and has now come to flaunt his debauchery infront of everyone! ” jacaerys remained quiet his hand unmoving.  like fish to bait the princess thought. she anticipated the queens reaction what surprised her was how public it was. a new variable. no matter she had come this far no way in the seven hells would she quit now. her eyes searched for and found rhaenyras her beautifull face painted one sentance i hope you know what youre doing.  “daughter please regain your composure.” otto attempted to calm his queens nerves. one public outburst escaping the family was bad two would be ruinous. rhaenyras eyes remained locked with her sisters the two communicating simply from eye contact. the younger sent a pleading look. not wishing to anihilate the little pieces of reconciliation the dinner had acheived the heir sprung into action.   “please your grace it has been an eventfull evening let us not end the night in animosity. the hour is late we ought to all retire and discuss this with the light of the new day.” daemon went to express his rage his atempted outburst swiftly sqashed by rhaenyra holding his arm. lucerys and rhaena immedietly stood up followed by helaena exiting at once not wishing to partake in the conflict.   alicent attempted to voice her dissagreement rage and adrenaline pulsing in her veins but could not the hand of her sworn shield along with her fathers stern gaze bringing her to reality.  aemond stood approaching the still-frozen couple. his imposing frame cornered that of jacaerys “carefull nephew should i find any truth to these accusations i will ensure you pay the price this time” and with that he pulled his sister away. she turned to look to her beloved for the final time time of the evening their eyes locked a silent promise to speak again.     the events of the night were all blurry in the young princes head. whithin less than a day he reunited with his aunt was btrothed to baela descited to put aside his feelings for his aunt witnessed a beheading had his feelings for his aunt reignited and was now accused of deflowering her.   after she was so rudely torn away from him the prince was faced with the fury of his betrothed. baelas face twisted in a way he had only previously seen on daemon it petrified him. “is it true ?” asked the girl. “what ? i dont-”   “it is a simple question jacaerys are alicents words true ?” “ofcourse not ! i would never do such a thing” tension was rising with each exchange of words “what was this buisness today then ?” “the princess fell what was i to do ? allow her to fall ?”   “she is the enemy jace you cannot trust these people” the words coming out of baelas mouth filled him with rage never before experienced “the enemy ? are you being serious ? you know nothing about the princess-” “neither do you.”   they were almost yelling daemon started to advance toward them. afraid of his stepfather he attempted to deescelate the situation.“i do apologise for any discomfort i have caused you baela but i will not stand to hear such nonsense.”   baela scoffed “if you are unable to see past the intentions of those who only mean to use you i hold in my heart not discomfort but pity for you my prince. goodnight. ” and with that she exited. by this time deamon hat taken the place of his daughter “come we have much to discuss” looking behind him one final time to see his mother and queen alicent speaking quietly he followed his stepfather.   they walked the halls of the keep solemnly daemons calm demeanor betrayed none of his emotions it only irritated jacaerys more and more as time went on. each torturous step made his mind race from the dance to the fight to the princess to her hands to his betrothed to daemon to his aunt again her lips her smile her body against his… it all was far too overwhelming.  the salvation from his torture came with their arival at his chambers. “come” daemon instructed oppening the door he could only follow instructions with the reverance of a septon executing the gods will afraid of arousing his uncles rage. “sit” he sat his uncle soon occupying the chair next to him.   “so did you do it ?”   if one more person asked him that question jace swore he would throw himself from the tallest window of the keep. “no i would never” daemon chuckled. “tis alright boy the flame of youth roars with unparalleled passion in this family especially i would not have blamed you if you had.” jace swallowed a weight lifted from his chest.   “alas what i believe matters not only what the queen does and as it stands she thinks you deflowered her most favourite daughter. how do you plan to answer these accusations ?”   “i…..i do not know. i would not go back on my promise to baela sir. i swear it” daemons hand reached his sons shoulder. “i know. worry not about baela. we must understand what possesed the greens to spread such a rumor they are coming for your inheritance boy the same as your mothers.”  heavens give me strength the young prince thought. “with all due respect you know nothing of who spread such a rumor. the princess would never soil her reputation in such a way. ”  “damn right she would not the princess is far from cunning enough” jacaeys hands turned to fists “it is certainly the work of her grandsire” he had had enough. “you only see the events of today as an excuse to express your violence”   “such are the tactics of war. we can not be seen as weak at this time jace. they mean to take yours and your mothers birthright to start the war and tear our forces apart-”  “i see finally you care not for me nor baela only for supporting the efforts of a war yet to materialise if it even is to materialise. you only seek glory for yourself- ” “myself ?” daemon interrupted “all i do i do in support of you and your mother”   “then allow us to counsil my mother before you jump straight to actions which might soil her name” daemon gave no answer. his wife was his weakness jacaerys knew it very well. and though he was prone to brash violet actions he did so in servitude of his family.   daemon stood up sudently still not having said a word. the young prince knew he had not quelled his bloodlust but the seeds of doubt planted in his mind would keep him occupied long enough. and so daemon exited.   before jacaerys was allowed a moment of respite not a few seconds after his fathers exit the painting near his window opened from behind.   emerging from the shadows none other than the princess. jacaerys was left speechless the night kept becoming stranger and stranger. “what-the…what h-how did you get here ?” he chocked out.  “i found a sort of map of the red keeps passageways when i was young. one of them leads from my chambers to these” replied the princess shyly. “have i disturbed you….i should leave my apologies-”  “no !” exclaimed jacaerys. the day had taken a toll on him daemon and baelas words giving him a lot to proces. one thing had not changed though he still longed to see her.   turning around from her attempt to exit the princesses face became illuminated by the candelight showcasing her hopefull expression. a beat of silence pased neither one of them knowing how to approach the other. the princess stepped forward fully entering the room.   he could now see her dress in detail a pure white nightgown flowing gently encasing her form. she looked like an angel sent from the heavens.   “my mother is very protective of me you must excuse her earlier actions she only meant to do good. i-i came to apologise for what went down at dinner” by now she was standing but a step away from him. the prince remained frozen afraid if he let his body move he would no longer remain a gentleman.   his silence caused the princesses face to fall slightly a disapointed expression threatening to take over the same one from earlier that night. he wished not to ever see her that way ever again “is that all you came here to do ?” he spoke up at last.  a small smile played at the side of her mouth “if i may excpress myself freely my lord ?” the pang of excpectancy in his chest rattled his body “jace and please do.”   “jace” she began the familiarity of the petname causing him to grow bolder. “i must say though these rumours are heinous i- i was ashamed not of my soiled reputation but for the fact they included you” the woman infront of him was a witch jace descited she was bewitching him with every word from her soft lips and he was oh so willing to fall for her spell.  “truth be told i have not forgotten of the time we shared at driftmark it may seem silly but since that day i have longed to see you again.&quot;she continued &quot;i know not of love …or lust but these feelings lay in my chest for so long i fear they may drown me”   her eyes looked to his through her lashes longing excpecting. once again he was left without words. “jace ? you instructed me to speak freely have i made you uncomfortable ?” her hand flew forward from her side softly brushing his knuckles sending chills to his body threatening to take his hand into her own but hesitating.   “are are you cross at me because of the rumors ?” the last bits of his composure were starting to crumble egged on by both her words and feathelike toutches.   “i could never. i would never hold over you something you have no control over” he replied unable to take her teasing toutches any longer taking his hand away in favour of toutching her elbow bringing her closer so much closer her other hand flew to toutch his chest.  mirroring his actions at the diner he placed his hand upon her cheek. “oh im so glad” she said in a breathless whisper.  “you had no play in spreading the rumors yes ?” her mouth oppened and closed eyes and body growing uneasy “y-yes how could i do something like that ? to you of all people” jace sucked in a hurried breath cursing himself for almost ruining the moment.   he brought her closer hand moving once again from elbow to back possesive and supportive. his thumb began to caress her cheek seeking retribution for his previous words. “ofcourse ofcourse you spilled your heart to me and i have gone and accused you.”   “no i understand.” their faces were now only centimeters away heavy breaths in tandem with eachother “there are many forces at play intending to keep us apart” jace continued. the words of daemon now but a whisper in his head caution having flown from the window the moment she toutched him.  “do you give them any thought ?”  “i could not if i wanted to. you say you have longed for me since driftmark my longing dates even further back. this force is pulling me toward you like the morning pulls the sun from its hiding and i fear if you were to be taken from me now i would never see the light again”  and with that the water tipped over his lips clashed against her. all the emotions pent up over the years releasing in a dance of mouths and tongue. her hands flew to his his hair trying to express all of the things words could not.  slowly the princes pushed her leg between his casuing him to step back slowly tracing a path toward the bed. when he felt the foot of the bed on the back of his knees he did not hesitate hands snaking to her thigh he lifted her slightly and fell back ever so carefull to not hurt her or to break the kiss.   her nightgown did little to hide her form now slowly falling off her shoulder exposing her chest. his mouth left hers for the first time only to trace a path down her neck. her hands pushing his face further into her hungry for more.   his hands on her thighs moved further and further up skirts riding up with them. her core now bare on his trousers right where he needed her most soft skin brushing up against hard fabric sending pleasured pulses to both her bodies.   she started moving her hips shyly back and forth head falling back the mewls escaping her lips music to his ears. by now the arousal in his pants was evident the friction from her movements doing little to aleviate his tension.   desperation was fogging his mind movements going from passinate to hungry. sloppy open-mouthed kisses on her neck moving lower and lower a silent prayer of devotion on her breast all he could think hear and feel was her.   lost in eachother and the new sensations they hearn naught og the comotion outside the rooms door.  without warning rhaenyra acompanied by the queen entered the room. the lovers were caught once and for all now bound together by duty. alicent began her scolding rhaenyra agreeing with her and joining. jacaerys took no time in taking a protective stance shielding the princesses face in his shoulder raising her nightgown back on her shoulder trying to maintain whatever semblance of was left to her name.      the princess awoke in her own chambers sadly the events of last night still ringing in her head. she could still feel the heat of jaces body on her face waist and lower… she knew she ought to be ashamed to order a carridge to the sept straight away and beg on her knees for forgiveness. yet she found no desire to do do.  satifaction filled her lungs with every breath. after alicent and rhaenyra had caught them jace was dragged away by his mother yet he accepted the consequences with a stiff lip and an air of pride. alicent still was clinging to her daughters innocence refusing to accept the situation as anything but her poor daughter being manipulated.  when aemond heard of the news he attemptet to take some form of retribution going as far as to propose a duel with jace in her honor. aegon had never looked so amused in his life he only congradulated his twin saying “atleast you sampled the mount before you commited”. her grandsire was once again the most composed figure of the evening out of satisfaction of securing his blood on the throne she thought. helaena had yet to learn of anything.  they had barely goten any sleep counseling all night in search of an answer to the situation. only one was viable. after the green and black council debated a clear course of action was set.   given the fact there was no chance of the princess being with child they would release a statement announcing the betrothal of the crown prince jacaerys to the secondborn daughter of the king reuniting the realm stated as the reason. the date of the wedding would be set in thee moons time as not to arouse any suspicion. as for princess baela negotiations for herbetrothal to lord cregan stark were already underway.   she walked to her vanity lazily brushing her hair. the smile on the woman in the mirror looking back at her she had not seen in years. each movement of her wrist was excecuted with queenly grace. life had meaning once again.  she stayed there a while pampering herself for she was a victor when a certain tapestry on her wall came out of place.   in stepped none other than jacaerys velaryon. jace. her jace. her future husband.  “jace” she said standing up. “you look… satisfied” began the prince all shyness from the night before gone. “should i not be ?” teased she. jace remained silent somewhat sullen looking to her form the morning light revealing to him just how transparent her nightgown was.  “i spoke with my mother last night she revealed to me some new information” the princess tensed afraid she was caught in her lies afraid all of her effort was for naught. his composure as he advanced toward her did nothing to sooth her nerves. he began to circle her form patiently awaiting an answer. “wh-what would that be my prince ?”  he stopped behind her. was it the formality of the title that caused his pause ? or was it anger ? “she said you wenr to her yesterday to plead your case for our betrothal. she said you almost begged to be perscise”   he had not corrected her calling him her prince leading her to the natural conclusion he was angry. “i-i apologise for not making you aware of such a fact last night. i hadnt the time to you see…” she craned her face back to look at him. begging with her eyes for some sort of reaction.   he looked down to her something dark behind his brown eyes. “how do you explain such an action ?” he said voice low and grainy.  there was little room of escape. she had to play her hand just right. “as i said i hadnt the time to fully explain myself to you. it is true i looked to rhaenyra to ask for your hand and…. the rumors were really not the reason but the excuse for my actions. i meant to… approach you from before” he remained silent.   she made an attemt to turn around and face him only to be prevented by his pressing himself to her back. “baela is of the oppinion wish to use me. both her and daemon said you mean to steal my mothers throne to take from me what you want only to betray me. tell me it is not true.” finally his true colors came to light. the darkness in his eyes was not born of malice but of desperation of fear.   “please you most not misunderstand my actions i only meant to be with you i have not lied i woud never. my family knew nothing of it. i understand how this must come across but please believe me you must.” her joice unashamedly betrayed her desperation to please him he remained silent still only holding onto her tighter.  “what must i do to make you believe me ? i will beg on my knees if it please you just trust me…” his body relaxed just slightly hands remaining on her stomach clinging to her dress. he gave a long exhale.   “i believe you” it was her turn to sigh runing her hands on his arms tracing lines over his toned forearms. “i believe you are a cunning spider who pounced on the opportunity to claim me for yourself.” his hand ascended her stomach reaching the space just under her chest playing with the ribbon tying adorning her gown. “i also believe your intelect to be so infatuating i cannot help but want you more…”   he pulled the end of the ribbon her dres becoming looser. “tell the truth did you stop to consider the possible consequences of your reckless actions once ?” his hand went higher unbuttoning the top of her dress torturously slow.   “i only thought of you every step of the way.” he continued his pursuit of unbuttoning her gown. “does this mean you accept my apology ?”  “yes my darling you need beg no longer… besides i would much prefer to see you on your knees for other purposes” with that he spun her around putting their lips together once again. only this time the kiss was less passionate and more possesive. they knew they were bound together forever.  her gown was barely hanging onto her body jace shruged the sleeves off her shoulders the gown pooling on her feet. he took a step back breaking the kiss to look at her. look at her whole. he drank in the sight of her body like the sweetest of wines. “perfect” he muttered under his breath but before the princess had a chance to reply he took her into his arms mouths clashing once again.   effortlessly he carried her to the bed gently placing her head on the pillows climbing on soon after. her hands reached to toutch his chest tugging on his tunic begging to have it removed. he complied hastily unbuttoning it. the morning light illuminated his porcelain skin showcasing his toned arms and chest.  his mouth descended upon her continuing his previous actions. one leg on her side the other nudged her legs apart knee pressing onto her core. she moaned upon the contact earning a chuckle from jace. “you are magnificent” he said innetween kisses. “my cunning girl”  the fabric on his knee got wetter by the second dampness reaching the skin underneath. his hand traced a path from her side down to her navel to her pelvis finally to where she needed him most. he began his ministrations on her pearl tracing slow circles each one sending waves of ecstasy along her body they reached her throat leading her to release a pleasured moan. “please keep quiet darling i would hate to be interrupted yet again”  his fingers on her core went lower seperating her slit pressing onto her. “wh-what-” she whispered trying desperately to hold back her moans “shhh worry not my dear i only mean to please”   “all i do i do to please you my love” with that his fingers penetrated her. sensing her incoming moan jaces hand flew to her mouth muffling her sounds only for him to hear. his fingers began to move setting a slow rythm allowing her to get used to the foreign sensation.   it was as if he had studied her body for years the reverance with which he treated her left a burning sensation in both her heart and core. he continued slowly picking up his pace settling into a new rythm his thumb took to restarting the ministrations on her pearl. she felt a knot forming in her stomach tesion on her chest becoming more and more and more…untill she felt she could go on no longer.   “j-jace…” she chocked out “i know i know darling…” he placed a tender kiss upon her forhead “let go its ok…” with that the tension in her stomach exploded pleasure enveloping her body settling into her limbs. “thats my girl..”   how long she spent lost in the throws of ecstasy she knew not a fog of pleasure clouding her mind leaving her to think only of jace. once she started to come out of it a bit he slowly removed his fingers earning him a whine at the loss of contact. he only chuckled.   she went to remove her lovers trousers but he prevented her movements taking her hands and giving each of them a kiss instead.   “allow us to keep something to look forward to on the wedding night.” he said positioning himself next to her on the bed placing her head to his chest playing with her long silver hair. they stayed like that a while simply enjoying the company of one another.   the princess spoke up “what is on you your mind my prince ?” he made an insulted face placing a hand of his heart “ do not call me that again lest you want me to be cross with you.” she chuckled her happiness causing his heart to swell with pride he was the reason behind her laugh “i am simply admiring my future wife”   she raised her torso to kiss him again all soppy and sweet. “i do have one last question to ask.” she fully raised her body legs across his lap and head neeling on his shoulder. “please do future husband”   “last i spoke with daemon he was ready to go to war in the name of preventing our betrothal. yet this morning he was all smiles and agreement i know it was not the efforts of my mother alone. what did you do ?”   “i fear if i answer that you may turn to cast me aside” she said begining to leave little kisses and kitten licks onto his neck. he took her jaw into his hand seperating it from his neck moving her to look into his eyes “we are in this together now fully my love. i wish to know of my wifes nature for i know i will come to love it i already have.”  “well if you insist… my ladys maid worked under the lord stark her father is a steward tasked with writting many of his lords official letters. she learned to writte in her fathers handwritting and well… a certain letter arrived late last night detailing the request of the lady baelas hand for his son cregan”   jacaerys gave a hearty laugh “ and it really took affect ?”   “ofcourse it did. the lord of winterfell will not question the crowns words they know better than to refuse an alliance with our house. by the time the source of the betrothal comes into question we will be on our honeymoon and alia settled with her own lover in braavos”   she looked to his eyes attempting to find any disgust anything that would show her she was unwanted by him aswell yet jace only looked to her with love and admiration. “you truly are a marvel my spider” he kissed her forhead one again then her brow her nose finally her lips.  “i hate to be taken away from you however….” he began tearing his body from hers seeking his discarded tunic. “we have a scheduled promenade soon. your mother is taking all the steps necessary in making us look like a prim and proper couple” he began puting his tunic back on the sight of his back muscles flexing giving the princess another rush of arousal.   she chuckled and changed her possition on the bed stretching her body intending to entice her lover back into joining her. he turned around to face her once last time the heavenly sight of her bare body making him question just how important appearances actually were. “do not play games with me girl i should hate to disapoint the queen again”   “i said nothing…&quot;she teased. &quot;you neednt say anything. one day you will be queen and you may torture our children in such a way or any way you see fit”

Warnings: Aegon being Aegon Canon events surrounding Aemond’s 13th birthday and the Madame (no explicit details.)  129 AC  The ocean water is warm today. It foams up as it crashes onto the shore where she stands barefooted. Today is a day full of uncertainties and untameable nerves. Today is the day she wil claim a dragon.   “You will become sick standing in the sea like that.” Jace says   “The ocean is warmer here on Dragonstone than on Driftmark.” Rhaella says dismissing his concerns.  “Are you excited?” He asks standing beside her letting the ocean wash over his boots.  “I am nervous. Sona has never been claimed before.” She sighs   “I am sure you will be able to do it” Jace assures her   “That is easy for you to say Vermax hatched while you were still a babe.” She sighs   “All true Targrayens are dragon riders. I will not see one of my children remain dragonless.”   Rhaella whips around to see Daemon approaching. He is relentless in his father-daughter bonding attempts.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; “Jacaerys your mother wishes to see you.” Daemon says   Rhaella ignores how he stands next to her after her cousin has left the beach. Waves crash against rocks as her eyes remain fixed on the horizon.  “This silent treatment is becoming old. You are ten and four you’re no longer a child.” He reminds her   “What does Rhaena think of me doing this?” She asks ignoring his comment “Of me trying to claim a dragon before her?”   “Her thoughts are not important….Sona has rejected her attempts before.” Daemon says “This dragon is for you Rhaella no one else.”   Daemon’s words are touching. Their relationship is still a rocky one though. The past three years have been spent with him flying between Dragonstone and Driftmark. After his marriage to Rhaenrya she had expected that he’d abandon her Baela and Rhaena. And yet every few weeks he’d show up on the shore with Caraxes at his side. He’d spend time with her younger sisters and then come barging into her room as though he owned the entire castle. It had taken many moons for them to have a fully civil conversation devoid of yelling and rude comments but eventually they formed a sort of friendship. That of course did not mean they got along just that she had come to tolerate him since he seemed intent on not leaving her life.  “The Dragonkeepers say that it is best to approach Sōna now. She enjoys afternoon naps and will become angry if we disturb her later in the day.” Daemon says   Sōna’s lair is darker than any night sky Rhaella has ever seen. Water drips from somewhere as she points the torch in front of her trying to see where the dragon might be. Gods she hoped she was not about to be eaten.  Another 50 paces into the cave and Rhaella is beginning to think the Dragonkeepers have lied about this dragon existing at all. The dampness of the cave is beginning to seep into her bones she swears every hair on her body has stood up on alert.   And then there is a glitter of white meeting her eyes the fire that barely illuminates a few steps in front of her has reached something magnificent.   Sōna’s brilliant blue eyes are staring at her. Rhaella is looking into the eyes of a dragon. A shiver snakes through her body as she maintains eye contact and slowly drops the torch.   “Zaldrīzes rȳbus lo mērī udrirzi Valyrio eglio ȳdrassua”  Daemon’s last words before she had entered this lair echo in her mind.   A dragon only listens if you speak in High Valyrian.   She finds herself unsure of what to do now so she speaks and prays to every god there is that this beast does not open her mouth to burn her alive.   “Iksā gevie.” She says slowly “Eman dreamed hen ao syt ñuha giez ābrar.  You are beautiful. I have dreamed of you for my whole life.   Sōna lets out a deep rumble and Rhaella is unsure about the dragon’s thoughts on her compliment.   She slowly begins to move towards the side of Sōna’s head. The dragon lets out another grumble as she draws close.   &quot;lykirī. Iksan daor kesīr naejot ōdrikagon ao.”   Calm down. I am not here to hurt you.   Rhaella’s heartbeat pounds in her ears as her hand touches Sona’s rough skin.   “Kesi sagon rōvēgrie raqirossa Sōna. Mazeminna care hen ao lo ao ivestragī nyke claim ao”  We will be great friends Sōna. I will take care of you if you let me claim you.   Rhaella gently runs her bare hand along Sōna’s jawline. The dragon lets out a sharp sound almost like a trill of sorts. Rhaella smiles as Sōna lets her continue. Has she truly done it? Has she truly claimed a dragon of her own?   Sōna lets out another gurgle before pushing her head further into Rhaella’s waiting arms.   “Sir iksi hēnkirī ēva morghon ñuha riña. Nyke kivio naejot gaomagon ao ȳgha”   Now we are together until death my girl. I promise to keep you safe.  Her voice is no more than a whisper into the cave but the dragon hears it all the same. Rhaella cannot help the wide smile that stretches across her face when her dragon lets out a noise of agreement.   “The winter snow reaches out and claims a woman. Black banners rise behind them. Green rises to meet the snow.”   Aemond is unsure what to make of his sister’s words. He had come to her room to play with his little niece and nephew who are learning how to stand on their own. They babble with happiness when he shakes a wooden dragon in their faces.   “The snow will meet green over fields of fire and blood” Heleana says not bothering to look up from her needlework.   “They are growing quickly.” Aemond says hoping to turn the conversation to something more lucid and interesting for him  “They eat often. The boy more than the girl.” Heleana says to him   “You will sit the Iron Throne one day Jaehaerys” Aemond says to the baby who grabs at his hand and attempts to place it in his mouth   Aemond smiles down at his nephew and niece they are two of the few living beings in this castle that do not fear him.   The castle is bustling with life as it often does during the day. Maids scurry about cleaning and rat catchers lead their dogs about the halls. The feel of his practice sword in its sheath is a familiar one as he makes his way toward where Cole awaits him in the training grounds. Normally he’d try to rouse Aegon from his sleep but it had been weeks since he had successfully dragged his older brother from bed to train.  The clashing of steel is better than any music he’s heard as Cole points out how to hold his arms in a way that keeps the sword from being knocked from his hands.   Aemond takes note of how he is rapidly approaching his teacher’s height. The top of his head is finally in line with Cole’s eyes just a few more years and he is sure he will outgrow him after all he is already a bit taller than Aegon.   “Have you heard the news?” Cole asks in between sips of water from a large flagon that sits nearby.   “What news?” Aemond asks not recalling anything his mother might have told him this morning at breakfast.   “Word from Dragonstone to the king. Rhaella Targaryen has claimed a dragon.” Cole says “Queen Alicent read it this morning to his grace.”   Rhaella had a dragon? Aemond wondered what dragon she might’ve claimed. He knew there were many unclaimed ones on Dragonstone. He tried to imagine the delicate Rhaella on the back of a beast like Vermithor. It was rather humorous in his mind.   “What dragon has she taken?” Aemond asked   “Your uncle conveniently left that out my prince” Cole said   Of course Daemon would leave that out. Aemond had wondered what changed between Rhaella and Daemon. The last time he had spoken to Rhaella she had been deadset on pretending he didn’t exist and now he was helping her claim some unnamed dragon. Maybe he ought to write her again. Things had been tense when he hugged her goodbye on Driftmark’s shores. Her nose had still been swollen from his punch which he regrettably had yet to apologize for.  For the first year they had exchanged many letters talking of mundane things such as Rhaella’s struggle with holding swords upright during her training with the Master of Arms at Driftmark. And how he had discovered that growing up also meant being forced to stand still for measurements to be taken regularly as he was outgrowing all his favorite clothes. Eventually though the letters became less frequent and one day stopped entirely. His mother said it was part of growing up and that it was all for the best since she was “separate” from their family. Aemond tried to believe her he truly did but at night when he lay in his bed he found himself missing Rhaella’s companionship.   “Shall we continue?” Cole asked snapping him from his thoughts.  Aegon could not believe he left his chamber for this. Surely his bed and cups of wine were better than all of this.  “It is your brother’s name day try to look presentable.” His mother had hissed in his ears when she pulled him down the many steps of the Red Keep.  Aegon did not care about Aemond’s name day. Why should he care if his brother was ten and three? Aemond was going to have a thousand name days Aegon didn’t see why he should bother himself to be at all of them.   He still could barely believe his Lord Father had been able to plan and attend this family dinner. Viserys had sent the invitations himself apparently wishing for his family to gather for Aemond’s name day. Aegon still thought it was a dull idea.   His eyes scan the dinner table and they land on Princess Rhaenys or more specifically who was next to her. His Uncle Daemon’s three daughters loud-mouthed as they were had grown Aemond’s friend most of all. That blue silk dress of hers was doing nothing to hide the curves Aeggon could practically taste from across the table.   “Stop your staring.” His…dear Grandsire said sending a kick to Aegon’s shin under the table   Aegon knows he is dense but even he does not miss they way Aemond’s eyes…or well eye…remain fixed on Rhaella through the night. Perhaps he has underestimated his little brother maybe there is more to him than books and sword training with Cole. Perhaps this was finally a chance for Aegon to introduce Aemond to true fun.   He can feel the smirk stretch across his face as he plans their evening in his mind. Yes it was finally time to bring Aemond into his world to show him what other fun there was to be had.  Rhaella has never felt more awkward. When Rhaenys had announced that they would attend a dinner for Aemond’s name day at the request of King Viserys she wished she could be like Lord Corlys and simply declare she would not go. It was not that she did not want to see Aemond she just felt distant from him.Perhaps it was the lack of apology for her face or maybe it was the three years that passed since she had chosen Driftmark over him. She swore he was still upset about all of that.   Aemond’s eye had been on her the whole night Rhaella couldn’t tell if that was a good or bad thing.   When they had first arrived Rhaella had sought him out perhaps it was just a force of habit but she had found herself at his door. When she peered in she had expected Aemond to look the way he did when she said goodbye to him on the shore of Driftmark a snot-nosed one-eyed boy who was begging her to get on the ship or climb aboard his new dragon with him. Instead she saw an entirely different person. He was sat with a large book. His newly broken voice had filled her ears he was practicing his Valyrian. His hair was just past his shoulders and Rhaella could tell he had grown significantly in their time apart surely he was taller than her now. What stuck out to her the most though was his face it had sharpened and become rather handsome most of all though a gleaming sapphire sat where his missing eye used to be.  She wasn’t sure why but she slipped away not bothering to alert him of her presence. Maybe his new appearance had startled her or hypnotized her she truly was unsure of it all.   After dinner had concluded Rhaella tried slipping away perhaps she’d visit the library the castle’s library had always been far superior to Driftmark’s.   “Are you scared of me?”   A foreign voice fills her ears just as she reaches the doors to the library.   “Aemond.” She breathes when she turns to face him his sapphire eye is now covered with a dark leather eyepatch “Were you following me?”   She did not hear any footsteps but that did not mean it was impossible.   “You did not look at me once during dinner. Nor did you visit when you arrived yesterday. You are avoiding me.” He said his voice had a twinge in it like his feelings were hurt.  When did he get so observant and bold?   “I was not avoiding you Aemond.” Rhaella said looking at him.   “Then why leave dinner so quickly you ran as tough your hair was on fire.” He jests   “You…” She decides it is best to be honest with him “You are making me nervous.”   Aemond lets out a snort of laughter.   “Why? Does my appearance frighten you?” He asks stepping closer to her so they were only an arms length away   “No! No. It is just…different. I was expecting the same boy who cried after I told him that I’d remain in Driftmark. You have grown up that is all.” She explained honestly   “As have you. You are ten and four now yes?” He asked   “Yes.” She said   It was uncanny how he was taller than her now truly unfair considering he was still younger than her.   “Aemond!”   What did she do to the gods that they were cursing her with Aegon’s presence?   “Aemond! Come the festivities are not over.” Aegon declared wrapping an arm around Aemond’s shoulders.   “Hello Aegon.” She greeted   “Yes hello.” Aegon greeted his eyes briefly scanning her up and down.   “Where are we going? Mother and father have both gone to bed.” Aemond asked confused.   “I am going to show you the world little brother” Aegon said   Rhaella thought that was a stupid sentence. It sounded like something out of a bad romance story.   “Might we bring Rhaella? I want to speak to her more.” Aemond asked   “No.” Aegon said immediately   Rhaella glared at him how dare he say where she could and could not go?   “It is for men only. You are a man now little brother or well you will be by the end of the night.” Aegon laughed “Come we’re going now.”   Rhaella watched as Aegon walked off.   “I am sure he is just taking me to some tavern he likes. It isn’t for noble ladies though.” Aemond said   “How long will you be gone?” Rhaella asked suddenly sad that he wasn’t going to stay with her.   “Not long. Wait in the library I’ll come to you when we’re done.” Aemond said before turning “I want you to tell me about the dragon you have claimed.”   Rhaella smiled as she watched Aemond race after his brother perhaps appearances had changed but he was still the boy she knew even though years had passed.   Aemond has never felt more unsure of himself. He has spent the last three years creating a person that is untouchable devoid of weaknesses and yet his hands are shaking and his mind is racing. Despite the late hour he sits in a bath that he ordered a maid to draw for him. The soap and soft rag are rubbing his skin raw as he tries to rid himself of the whore’s sickly sweet perfume.   Aegon’s laughter was ringing in his ears. The way his elder brother had laughed and pointed as her hands had run down his body. She had been soft and warm yet Aemond had not enjoyed any of it. His skin felt like it was crawling when it had ended. Why did Aegon enjoy doing that regularly? Surely acts like that were not worth dedicating entire establishments to.   His hair is sticking to his neck as he sits in the water. Perhaps if he sits here long enough he will be washed away and the memories of tonight will fall away as well. His eye squeezes shut when he recalls the way her voice had sounded in his ears loud and wonton almost like the sound of a dying animal.   Fuck. He wished he could take it all back he should’ve ignored his brother and just gone to bed then all would be right and he wouldn’t wish to peel his skin from his bones. His skin is red by the time he is done with it all. Surely he has removed the layer that her hands were all over.   He feels dizzy as he forces himself out of the comfort of the bath. He thinks of Rhaella surely she is not waiting for him still.   Once he is dressed though his legs lead him to the library anyway. Maybe he is just seeking comfort in familiarity but all he knows is for once in his life he is not alright with being alone. The library is silent and very dark when he enters. He nearly turns back to return to his own chamber when a pale flicker of light catches his eye.  A stump of a candle is all that illuminates the scene he finds her in. Her head is resting in her arms as half her body is resting on the table. Her nose is whistling ever so slightly as she sleeps. He quietly sits down next to her just her presence is enough to calm his racing mind. Her long hair is free from its usual braids and tumbles down her shoulders. It is softer than it looks as he wraps a strand around his finger. His eye examines her face that is just barely illuminated by the candle. Her features had sharpened just like his had the past three years and Aemond cannot deny that it suits her. Her familiar scent invades his nose as he rests his head on the table to stare at her he smiles as he thinks of her waking to find him next to her.  “Gevī”   Beautiful     And so we dig into the romance of the story…  Sorry if the Valyrian is wrong obviously I’m not fluent in it and I used an online translator for this story.  By the way Sōna means snow in Valyrian. ;)     Next Part   Comment below to join the taglist. (The taglist is not by chapter once added you will remain there unless you ask to be removed.)

When it is over Aegon will stop at nothing to get her back. Based off this request 18+ ONLY implied dubcon mental illness &amp; violence   Long before the dragons dance Y/N is promised to Aegon. As a result Rhaenyra sends her only daughter to the North in hopes of securing an alliance and to keep her half brother at bay.   His desire for the princess Y/N is deprived even Alicent could not comprehend it. In the years Y/N is gone Aegon yearns for her a longing set deep into his bones.   Y/N finds real love without sharp edges. His name is Jonathan Stark after whom their son is named. His body now hangs like a trophy in Aegon’s garden.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; The war brought one tragedy after another. Her mother and three if not four of her brothers were slain.   As for the greens only Aegon and Alicent remain.   Y/N was taken back to King’s Landing upon Aegon’s victory. She is to be his prize. As a warm welcome he strung up her husband and allowed her to watch the light fade from his eyes.   Jon is spared the sight of his father’s remains shielding his eyes with his mother’s dress as she whispers to him.   “I love you more than anything in this world.” She tells him “no matter what becomes of me you mustn’t be afraid. You must be strong.”  His hold on her tightens as they are forced into the throne room to meet the king. A man his mother has no love for. The man who killed his father.  “Ahh good you’re here.” Aegon grins rising from his perch. “We need to prepare you for dinner.” The front of his robes are stained with blood.   Her husband’s blood.  “I will admit I was not expecting two guests. Luckily the coronation will not take place until the morrow. Which gives us time to fit robes for our boy.” The King smiles at Jonathan.   Y/N clutches her son closer as he begins to cry. “Shh.”  “Tell me now dearest what is his name?”  “His name is Jonathan.”  “Jonathan.” Aegon looks to the boy clinging to his mother. “A fine name for a prince.”  “T-thank you your grace but I am not a prince.” The boy sniffles.  Aegon bends forward to his eye level. “You are now. In one day’s time your mother will be crowned queen of the seven kingdoms and you our heir. Now that you are here we will be a proper family.”  “I had a family.” Jonathan reminds him.  Y/N tucks the boy farther against her side.  Aegon sighs standing to face Y/N. “There there my darling.” He dries her tears with a blunt swipe of his hand.  “Please don’t hurt him he doesn’t understand.”  “I am not going harm him.” Aegon scoffs. “He grew inside your womb same as our children will.”  “Ours?” Y/N breathes clutching her son’s hand. Aegon has well and truly lost his mind.  “I’m going to be your father now.” Aegon tells Jonathan. “There will be no more talk of the man who tried to steal your mother from me. Do you understand?”  Jonathan nods against his mother’s dress.  “Good” Aegon inhales deeply wrapping them both in his arms. “Welcome home.”  ————————————————————————  “Why are you doing this Aegon?” Y/N asks staring out the window to the garden.  “You were promised to me.” He tosses his chalice against the wall stumbling toward her. “You will marry me. You will love no one but me! That is why Stark is dead that is why his body will hang until only his bones remain.”  “How can you be so cruel?” Y/N cries wrapping both arms tightly around herself.  “This is a kindness my dearest love.” Aegon says draping his arms over hers “in time you will see. You’ve lost your way. But you will learn I will teach you.”  She has to get away. “Please-”  He sneers. “You will do a fair share of begging in our lives together there is no need to start prematurely.”  “What do you want?”  Has he not made it abundantly clear? “You.”  “I am only a woman. You understand that do you not?” Y/N scoffs. “There is nothing I can give you another cannot. Why chase me? Why hunt me down when you could’ve had anyone?”  “I realize we have our differences but there is no other woman capable of evoking such passion in my heart. I love you I loathe you. You frustrate and entice me.” He nips at her neck. “It was always going to be you sooner or late.”  “I had a life Aegon.”  “Now you will have a new life with me.”  ————————————————————————  As days pass Y/N allows her mind to wander. To escape the vessel in which it’s held; far enough that she doesn’t feel. In time it begins drifting farther and farther out to sea.  Aegon plays with Jonathan lifting him high on his shoulders the way her husband used to.   Jonathan takes a liking to him. Anytime he asks about his father he is met with a sigh.  “Do you see that pretender anywhere around here?”   Jon shakes his head.  “And you never will.” Aegon snickers. “There is no need to keep asking as you know it upsets me.”  The boy lowers his eyes “yes father.”  “You are a Targaryen. Not a Stark.” Aegon taps his chin “all of this will be yours one day.”  Aegon is a madman but he does seem to care for them in his own demented way.   Y/N loathes herself for even thinking it.  A few weeks after her belly begins to round with Aegon’s child. Y/N nearly forgets why she is here. Why she has to float away.   Aegon is all but tethered to the tiny bump kissing it each day as it grows.   Jonathan is the only reason Y/N holds onto hope. Though sometimes she can hear his father calling from the garden.  Aegon is speaking to her then plush lips moving over perfect teeth.  It catches her off guard the look of him. A fallen angel cast out by the gods. So like her mother. Y/N desperately misses her mother.  Aegon smiles as she caresses the side of his face ignoring her distant gaze. He knew she would come round eventually.  “Why do you think my mother hasn’t come to see me?” Y/N asks with wide sad eyes.  Oh…you poor poor thing. Aegon kisses her outstretched hand. She does not remember nor does it matter. It’s best not to upset her. “I am sure she will turn up sooner or late my dearest love.”  She believes him she has to.

Many lords whispered that she was far better suited to run someday Bear Island than her brother Lord Rodrik two years her junior who was spoiled hot-tempered and was already rather fond of girls angering the village by lifting the little girls’ (and not so little) skirts.   Soon a raven was sent before her tenth nameday; Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen offered to take Aurynn to her court in exchange for House Mormont’s loyalty and generous gifts. Lady Alys Blackwood Aurynn’s mother and aunt of Samwell Blackwood encored it ordering the best dresses and furs for her daughter of the colours red black and brown: House Targaryen and Mormont’s. With a loyal guard to keep the lady safe Aurynn was shipped to Dragonstone. There she bent the knee and presented the Princess with a precious and heavy necklace which resembled the crown of King Jaehaerys which the princess adored and thanked by kissing each cheek of the strikingly beautiful little girl.   Closest in age to Prince Jacaerys Velaryon they soon became the closest friends and both were devoted to one another and often took on the role of the second parent of Prince Lucerys and Prince Joffrey. When the fight in which Prince Aemond’s eye was lost Mushroom swears that Lady Mormont had punched Daeron in the throat while Maester Glyadyn affirms that she stayed behind soothing Princess Helaena shouting for Laenor or Ser Erryk all in vain. However when questioning came in King Viserys deeming her a neutral party asked her if Aemond had truly called the boys bastards in which she says he did and Aegon and Daeron egged him on. It is said that Lord Mormont demanded a compensation for the trauma his precious Northern Sapphire had gone through. It was Lady Alys and Lady Aurynn herself who soothed her father’s rage and agreed to a coffer of gold and the promise to assign a far more prestigious knight to protect the lady.   While she was not present during Lady Laena’s funeral or Rhaenyra’s wedding to Prince Daemon she was widely vocal about her joy over the marriage even if it was rushed. While it set her at odds with other lords salivating over the widowed princess they said nothing deeming her as a small girl who has read far too many romance books. It did not set her at odds with the princes and ladies Baela and Rhaena to whom she was attached to the hip. They had an overall good childhood and when Vermax was big enough he often took her riding soaring the skies.   However the moment Baela and Jace were betrothed something inside her told her to keep her distance from Jace and he from her. He had told her expecting of her a reaction. She instead simply smiled and congratulated him on the nuptials and closed the door. For a long time she learned to repress her feelings and never once resented Baela for what had been a plain as day Westerosi betrothal among the Great Houses.   However her life would change forevermore the moment Princess Rhaenyra changed the rules of the game by betrothing her to Prince Jacaerys and betrothed Baela to her lord brother Rodrik.   This decision would have consequences that would become key parts of what would be known as the Dance of the Dragons in which Aurynn would take part and survive… at a high price.“,2024-07-14 03:08:04 GMT

There are many justifications for this but none of them please me so this is my tribute to the dream tamer…   Previously - Index - Next  The air was dotted with stars their fire thousands of miles away illuminating the earth that burned like never before.  Fire salt tears.   Wind was nothing more than a memory.   The walls were damp red and moving like sea waves. Contracting and expanding swallowing. The water that covered her from the knees down was bright green so bright and beautiful that it made her want to cover herself completely in it but she couldn’t something in the back of her mind screams that was dangerous to play with that.   Muffled screams outside remind her that she must keep going she couldn’t stop now. She needed to climb.  The girl climbs the narrow damp walls and when she finally manages to stand the floor sinks beneath her feet. It’s fluffy lumpy and rough there are traces of the green liquid there. In front of her a narrow corridor of raw flesh stands the sides covered in ivory white stakes that come from the floor and ceiling. Hot wind passes through the gaps between the stakes but doesn’t burn her. Nothing can burn her. She’s made of dragon’s blood.   A gutural noise echoes up the hole she came out of and it contract’s again. The girl turns and stares in terror at the sight: wild fire. It climbs the hole slowly and then expands. It wasn’t green water it was wild fire. The walls open and the fire covers everything in a strong and destructive breath. The ground above her feet disappears she’s falling and when she looks up she can only see the dragon that spat her out close its mouth and fly away rocked by it’s withered wings. She screams but the dragon doesn’t comeback to save her.  Why doesn’t he come back?! She was like him her blood was fire too! Why didn’t he come back?   Her skin falls apart scattering into the air until all that remains are bones of her former self and silver hair. Warm wind embraces her in her fall. She looks up seconds before being embraced by the ground and sees the moon full like never before explode and expel a million dragons.  When the dragon’s blood finishes its fall the ground turns into ice and Celaena opens her eyes.  “The dragon…” Celaena screams sitting up in bed when he finally woke up. She was drenched in sweat her hands were shaking and her breathing was uneven.   She was used to these dreams the ones that seemed too real. When she was immersed in them she didn’t know how to get out. Celaena knew they were just dreams that nothing could hurt her body but the mind… It was her mind she was worried about.   The light emanating from the window bathed the room in a silvery glow the moon was full huge like never before just like in the dream. Its comfortable glow contrasted with the infernal heat in the room She was sweating so much that she had wet the bed sheets.  How disgusting what would they think of her? She was no longer a little girl she was already twelve years old and practically a woman. Imagine what they wouldn’t think if they thought she still wets the bed when she sleeps? No. Celaena couldn’t let the news spread. She got up and took the sheets off the bed throwing them in the fireplace so quickly that she didn’t even needed to think.   As soon as she finished cleaning the bed she looked for a new nightgown among the countless trunks that her servants had brought from Dragonstone. Celaena didn’t understand why there was a need for so much clothing since they would leave shortly after the end of the tournament still she mentally thanked the maids every time she woke up sweaty at dawn and had a clean nightgown to wear.   Outside the Red Keep the city was in an uproar the arrival of nobles from all corners of the kingdom certainly boosted local commerce and of course the festivities too. King’s Landing was the kind of city that was alive at night but Celaena’s room only had the view of the Blackwater bay that ran slowly with the soft shushes of the water. She could hear the ordinary people in the city living their lives screaming moaning laughing… she could also hear the dragons roaring in the pit and… no this roar was too close.  Celaena’s lost eyes turn to the moon through the window full like never before as if it would explode and expel thousands of dragons like in the dream the girl had just woken up from. There was a black spot in front of the moon cutting it in a smooth and slow flight. The roar of that creature echoed throughout the Red Keep like a lullaby to Celaena’s ears she knew who it was immediately.  The Dreamstealer circled the Red Keep in the air as if it were his prey his orange eyes swept the countless towers gardens gates and windows until they settled on the only thing he could recognize as his: Celaena. As soon as he saw her he changed his flight path diving towards the balcony where she was waiting for him with a huge smile on her lips.   His long wings swept the ground spreading dust and star’s as he landed messing up the little girl’s hair and nightgown. He was young so small that she was barely able to put a saddle on his back but she loved him.   He was the most beautiful dragon to be born in centuries the blue and purple scales contrasted creating an almost boreal effect never seen before. When he flew in the night sky the only thing that gave him away was his bright orange eyes that adorned his face like little suns. He was a wild dragon that hated being caged but was also extremely gentle and faithful to his owner.   “Skoriot emagon ao issare Dreamstealer?”   “Where have you been dreamstealer?”  Asked the Targaryen approaching her dragon and touching its nose. There is more in dragons than ordinary men can understand and the Targaryens understood this on a certain level their dragons might not speak but they always made it clear what they wanted and Dreamstealer wasn’t any different. He tilted his head towards Celaena’s body poking her and then pointing back to the moon.   He wanted to fly.  “Nyke kostagon daor sōvegon sir. Se istia sagon isse zaldrīzes ripo.”   “I can’t fly now. And you must be in dragon pit.”  She scolds him but can’t seem angry at all just enchanted by the beautiful creature in front of her. Celaena always found herself admiring Dreamstealer and couldn’t get used to how beautiful and unique he was the smallfolk used to say that Targaryens were closer to gods than to men and for Celaena that was true because there is no way that there is anything more divine than dragons in this whole wide world.  “Ēdā iā bantis ossȳngnon tolī?”  “Did you have a nightmare too?”  Dreamstealer grunts poking her again he wanted to fly. He didn’t need words to make it clear that he too had been disturbed by the world of dreams. Celaena’s mother told her that in her first years of life she used to spend the nights screaming in her sleep that she would be disturbed and woke up sweaty and shaking every night. These nightmares only calmed down after Daemon gave her the egg that gave birth to Dreamstealer.   The bond between them was remarkable sometimes it seemed like he was more people than dragon that he understood her like no one else could. When Celaena cried he did too when he was sick he also weakened and when she had nightmares he was also disturbed.   There were no records of such a dragon.  “Bantis zōbrie issa se ossȳngnoti lēdys yn kostā sōvegon isse lyks ñuha byka mēre. Iksan ȳgha.”   “The night is dark and full of terrors but you can fly in peace my little one. I am safe.”  With one last touch to the dragon’s forehead Celaena stepped aside to give him space as he reluctantly took flight. His long shiny wings sweeping the ground. He was like a dream but better than anything she could ever dream about.  “My lady?” the voice coming from inside the room woke her up and Celaena quickly turned her back on the balcony and returned to the room.   “Sor!” she scolded him as soon as she closed the balcony door and could look at him. She didn’t know that man he wasn’t her sworn sword sor Daren Waters. “What makes you think you can come in uninvited?”  &quot;Nothing my lady” replied the man with a cheeky smile making a short bow. “Forgive me for coming in without asking permission but I heard a noise and thought-”  “Oh no… it’s not your fault. Sor Daren should have warned you that I have these night terrors and might end up screaming.”  The soldier nodded he was gigantic and very beautiful. Celaena was used to seeing the same men every day the dragon seeds her mother took in as her wards and common people who served in Dragonstone. That soldier was different from the people she was used to he didn’t have an ordinary face neither was Valyrian. He’s features were something else men usually made Celaena afraid with their perverted eyes that found pleasure even in a child like her but his eyes were big and kind and even if she tried she couldn’t feel afraid of him. It was almost funny how respectfully he avoided looking at her body it made her want to smile.   “Oh sor Daren warned me about the screams but there was something else a-”   “A big noise like thunderstorm coming from my chambers?”   “Exactly!” he responded clicking his tongue against the roof of his mouth eliciting giggles from the young lady.   “That was my dragon sor…”  “Harwin” the nameless soldier finally introduced himself and Celaena couldn’t help but echo the name sliding it off her tongue. Harwin… “Exactly. Harwin Strong my lady. And… a dragon? What was he doing here at such a time? Shouldn’t he be in the pit?”  “He had a nightmare” replied the young lady knowing it would sound childish but with no better answer than the truth.  “A nightmare… just like you did.”  “Yes sor Harwin just like I did.”   His gentle eyes carefully analyzed the lady’s strictly serious face trying to distinguish if that was really true or if she was just trying to have a laugh at his expense.  “Impressive” he concluded after a few seconds of silence shaking his shoulders and looking around. “So there’s no threat against you in this room?”  “That depends sor are you a threat?”  “I don’t think so my lady” replied Harwin bowing again.  “Great. Thank you sor Harwin.”   “At your service my lady.”     N/A: I know this may seem confusing but my intention is to follow a POV structure similar to GOT so yes there’ll be chapters from the pov of several oc’s and maybe canon char’s.   Also again: please be kind. English is not my first language and is hard asf to translate especially because some things sound great like real poetry in my language but in English it doesn’t work. 😭 (crying in latino america)  Continue in:,2024-07-14 02:55:56 GMT

A/N: Y&#x27;all this was supposed to be funny (got to thinking more after I made this post) but I sat down and started typing and blacked out and was apparently possessed by the spirit of GRRM because… this is not funny. A version of Aemond lives in my mind that actually mellows with age but it is not this Aemond. Warnings: Non-graphic deaths mention of suicide depression  Aegon didn’t deserve to be king. Aegon didn’t deserve a lot of things.  Aegon is already dead.  That’s what he tells himself when he finds them. Sunfyre is dying—Vhagar could fly him back to the Dragonpit but why? He’ll be dead in a month anyway.  Sunfyre is dying. Aegon is already dead.  They had been friends once hadn’t they? If they had he can’t remember.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; He remembers a pig with wings Aegon cackling with glee as he drags Aemond through the streets on his name day the disgust in his eyes whenever someone showed Aemond any special attention an egg that never hatched.  No they had never been friends. Not even as children. Certainly not now.  Aegon is already dead.  “Dracarys” he says.  Someone shouts behind him; he barely hears it over the roar of Vhagar’s breath as she incinerates Sunfyre and Aegon.  “Aegon was already dead” he whispers over the screams of the dying dragon.  Cole is shouting screaming. “What the hell happened?”  “Sunfyre would never have survived.”  “But the king—!”  “The king is dead.”  ~~~  Daeron crowns him.  The crown sits heavy on his brow heavy they say so he who wears it never forgets the weight of his responsibility.  Well.  His shoulders are strong.  ~~~  King Aemond Targaryen is not beloved by the small folk. He is not the Realm’s Delight not the Brave not he Conciliator not even the Queen Who Never Was.  He is the Kinslayer and the Kingkiller but that will be enough.  No one laughs at him now.  ~~~  Helaena falls farther into grief and madness and he can do nothing for her. He and Daeron and Cole lead the army and though they are outnumbered by Rhaenyra’s dragons he has Vhagar and one by one they fall.  It does not matter that he is winning. Not to those around him.  All the small council worries about is who will inherit the throne what marriage will provide the best alliance.  All Alicent says is “Aemond you must take a wife produce an heir—”  But he doesn’t want a wife he doesn’t need a wife he needs an heir.  He has an heir.  He has Jaehaera.  Jaehaera who walks to small council meetings with him who clambers up the steps of the throne to sit on his knee while he hears petitions who sings to Morghul and Helaena and the cats who replaced the ratcatchers after Aegon hanged them all.  ~~~  “Jaehaera” he says quietly leaning forward as he sits cross-legged in front of her playing with the little wooden dragons.  She tilts her head beaming at him.  “Jaehaera I am proud of you. You are a brave girl and beloved by all and you make your family proud. When I die you will be queen.”  She frowns like she can’t imagine a world in which he could die.  He could. He imagines that world every day.  “And until then I will teach you everything I know.”  So he does. He teaches her to fly to speak High Valyrian to fight with a sword and a spear and her words sharp as steel even as her heart is soft.  ~~~  He looks to Helaena and she knows she knows what he did. She knows the sounds of the screams he hears in the small hours of the night.  ~~~  King Aemond Targaryen is not beloved by the small folk.  And if whispers of Maegor follow him around what does he care? Maegor had been king had he not?  And he is not cruel—he will never be cruel—but he does rule. He is the king after all.  ~~~  King Aemond is beloved by the army. They will follow where he leads cheering Vhagar’s shadow and Blackfyre’s flash.  Cole however cannot be trusted. He watches too closely. He schemed without Aegon when he was king he is like to scheme without Aemond now.  Cole dies in an ambush and new generals rise up to take his place.  ~~~  He looks to Alicent to Otto to Daeron. They incline their heads. “Your Grace” they call him even as they tell him what to do.  “Marry” Otto tells him. “Forge an alliance.”  “Sire heirs” Alicent tells him. “Strengthen your claim and your line.”  “Remember your betrothed” Daeron winks. “I hear she yet draws breath.”  He doesn’t want Floris Baratheon. He doesn’t want any of them.  He wanted Lucerys alive and locked in a dungeon somewhere he wanted Helaena to be safe and happy he wanted Daemon to admit he was afraid of him.  He wants now to marry Daeron off to the daughter of the first lord that comes asking. Let him have Floris Baratheon if she still draws breath. Let him forge an alliance and sire children but let him also be gone.  ~~~  They eye the throne all of them.  They wait for the day Aemond falls in battle so they may put another puppet on the throne just as they did when Viserys died.  Aemond does not fall.  He watches Otto live out his years many of them before the old man simply does not wake one morning.  Daemon and Jacaerys die above Harrenhal and Vhagar roars her victory to the Riverlands.  Helaena’s grief eats at her a cancerous growth born of Jaehaerys’s murder and fed by every deed since. She pitches herself from the window of her room. Dreamfyre is a formidable fighter but she will not go to battle without a rider.  Aemond and Daeron fly alone.  Rhaena disappears; Baela betrays Rhaenyra; the wild dragons and the riderless dragons fall to the small folk and when the people of King’s Landing storm the Dragonpit and kill every dragon there Aemond is over Dragonstone killing Syrax and Rhaenyra.  The war—his war—takes them all. There are no dragons left but Vhagar no Targaryens left but him and the girl who watches him with such wide eyes.  The Last Dragon they call him to his face. To his back he is the Mad Dragon as the years wear on but the Keep has ears and the Dragon knows.  No one laughs at him. Not for a long time now.  ~~~  Her mother is dead and his mother is dead and there is no one left and he cries as he sits on the Iron Throne in the small hours of the night.  Sometimes Jaehaera comes down barefoot from her room and sits at the foot of the throne and stares at him a thousand years of heartbreak in her eyes and he stares back.  Whose eye stares from the socket he wonders. Can he even lay claim to it anymore? Is it Lucerys’s? Does his niece see Daemon looking back at her?  She looks like Helaena but sometimes Aegon and sometimes Viserys but mostly he sees Rhaenyra when he looks at her and someday he will die and all this will be done and he wonders what would have happened had he never been born had his egg hatched had Aegon lived had he sided with the Blacks to spite Aegon had he forgiven Lucerys.  He will always wonder and so will they.,2024-07-14 02:28:08 GMT

14,House of the Dragon,['hotd spoilers'  'maester conspiracy'],nitewolf14,I have a question. Putting aside ether you are team green or team black answer me this. Why the hell werent Allicent’s kids born with brown hair? Aren’t we led to believe brown hair/black hair is supposed to be some kind of dominant gene trait? Is it because Viserys was a pure bred Valyrian and that carried his genes through? This wouldn’t exactly make sense though! Even Rhaenys had black hair and Aemon was a pure Valyrian and he married a Baratheon I’m confused on how this didn’t happen with Allicent as well. Is this all just story convince for the sake of writing a war? Elia Martell had two children by Rhaegar and Rhaenys looked like a Martell while Aegon was reported to look like his father pale hair and all. Aegon the unworthy had VARIOUS children that had various genes when it came to hair skin color and eyes. Rosey the Otherys siblings Aegor Rivers Mya Rivers Brynden Rivers and Gwenys Rivers being examples of some of the children he had. Now don’t get me wrong not all the kids Aegon the unworthy had were described but we DO know at least that bittersteel had purple eyes and black hair. That checks out then we can assume the rest of them were a healthy mix of their parents. Besides the oddball Brynden aka Bloodraven and Shiera who had rare mismatched eyes like Alyssa Targaryen.   Now riddle me this. How is it possible NONE of Alicents kids came out with her coloring yet most of Rhaenyra’s kids did? At the very least some of Alicents kids should have had different eye colors yet there’s no mention of it on the contrary her kids looked like perfect Valyrian children. But…that’s not how genetics work 😭 at least ONE of them should have been the odd one out and some of Rhaenyra’s kids with Harwin should have come out with one of her characteristics in some way. Yet that’s not what happened!   Truthfully 😭 I think the Maesters either lied about the characteristics of the children or they put in false information to make the Targaryen’s to look as bad as possible. Fire and blood was made many centuries after the fact. It would have been so easy to just write out whatever you pleased about how people looked because no one was alive from that time period anymore 🤷🏾‍♀️ everyone around the current timeline in asoiaf would look to this history book as fact with no question because of how trusted they are supposed to be(because we know that the people in the story know of what happened back then. So at the very least the book has been around for a few years. Or at least the accounts of what happened has at any rate)  Sure this could also be writers convince to write out the war but that’s so boring! 🤣 Not to mention there was literally a war dedicated to bastard Targaryens and how they looked!   This was just something that struck a cord in me and I thought it would be something fun to dive into!,2024-07-14 04:53:28 GMT

I actually would like to hear the opinion of other people on this.   This season have been show Rhaenys showing a oddly suport for Jaehaerys I Targaryen the man directly responsible for her loosing her crown. What makes me believe that in a weird way she not only accept loosing the crown and there are other elements that suport this. But as well a understanding that this is how things on Westeros work. She knows supporting Rhaenyra is a lost Battle and makes her death scene so powerful having this is mind because you could see in her eyes she accept that fate. And she still deep down believe Rhaenyra killed her son. And yet she gives in marriage Baela and Rhaena to those bastards kids in attempt to make Velaryon blood descendants for Difmark.   And is heavy show in S1 that her suport for them is based of those marriage connections. Whatever while there is a long conversation how Helaena marring with Jace could save the war or not (clearly wouldn’t) I wonder what Velaryon would still suport Rhaenyra if actually Alicent had make a deal in marrying Baela and Rhaena to Aegon and Aemond. We saw Aegon showing some sexual interest in Bella And makes you wonder how Aemond and Rhaena dinamic would have play out considering he took from her the opportunity to hide her mother’s dragon. Those relationship would be way richer to develop and play out than any of the young parings on TB.   And I think that also would make for sure Rhaenys support TG and the Valaryon suport TG what immediately would make Rhaenyra claim that they are not bastard fall even under.   And while in the book make sense they being betrothed to each since kids because Laena/Daemon relationship with Rhaenyra/Laenor. The show cute that down by making Daemon isolate his wife because they cut off completely the possible queer relationship between Rhaenyra and Laena so they could possible bait #that fandom. Taking out all those elements makes no sense that Rhaenys didn’t though on making a union between her granddaughters and Aegon and Aemond.   Daemon could be the only that wouldn’t support this idea but at same time I wonder considering how much he is interesting in the actual crown how much he would he being against in securing that he acual offspring would directly inherit the throne.   Of course that means if cared enough of his daughters as his heiresses. Because clearly both him and Colarys don’t care really about blood but names male names blood related or not than the actual Velaryon blood that if this comes in the figure of a women. Falling to the ground the Idea that TB is the pro feminism team in my opinion.   Even so if somewhat they still menage to convince Daemon into marrying his daughters to Aegon and Aemond so his offspring would be king or queen  this war would be way more complex because wouldn’t be just Targaryens vs Targaryans but also Valaryons vs fake Valaryons and Valaryons bastards when they come in later. Daemon would directly fight his daughters to maintain the rights of his children with Rhaenyra. Meanwhile Baela and Rhaena would fight for their right over Difmark agaist Luke/ Addan and Aly.,2024-07-14 04:05:26 GMT

When it is over Aegon will stop at nothing to get her back. Based off this request 18+ ONLY implied dubcon mental illness &amp; violence   Long before the dragons dance Y/N is promised to Aegon. As a result Rhaenyra sends her only daughter to the North in hopes of securing an alliance and to keep her half brother at bay.   His desire for the princess Y/N is deprived even Alicent could not comprehend it. In the years Y/N is gone Aegon yearns for her a longing set deep into his bones.   Y/N finds real love without sharp edges. His name is Jonathan Stark after whom their son is named. His body now hangs like a trophy in Aegon’s garden.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; The war brought one tragedy after another. Her mother and three if not four of her brothers were slain.   As for the greens only Aegon and Alicent remain.   Y/N was taken back to King’s Landing upon Aegon’s victory. She is to be his prize. As a warm welcome he strung up her husband and allowed her to watch the light fade from his eyes.   Jon is spared the sight of his father’s remains shielding his eyes with his mother’s dress as she whispers to him.   “I love you more than anything in this world.” She tells him “no matter what becomes of me you mustn’t be afraid. You must be strong.”  His hold on her tightens as they are forced into the throne room to meet the king. A man his mother has no love for. The man who killed his father.  “Ahh good you’re here.” Aegon grins rising from his perch. “We need to prepare you for dinner.” The front of his robes are stained with blood.   Her husband’s blood.  “I will admit I was not expecting two guests. Luckily the coronation will not take place until the morrow. Which gives us time to fit robes for our boy.” The King smiles at Jonathan.   Y/N clutches her son closer as he begins to cry. “Shh.”  “Tell me now dearest what is his name?”  “His name is Jonathan.”  “Jonathan.” Aegon looks to the boy clinging to his mother. “A fine name for a prince.”  “T-thank you your grace but I am not a prince.” The boy sniffles.  Aegon bends forward to his eye level. “You are now. In one day’s time your mother will be crowned queen of the seven kingdoms and you our heir. Now that you are here we will be a proper family.”  “I had a family.” Jonathan reminds him.  Y/N tucks the boy farther against her side.  Aegon sighs standing to face Y/N. “There there my darling.” He dries her tears with a blunt swipe of his hand.  “Please don’t hurt him he doesn’t understand.”  “I am not going harm him.” Aegon scoffs. “He grew inside your womb same as our children will.”  “Ours?” Y/N breathes clutching her son’s hand. Aegon has well and truly lost his mind.  “I’m going to be your father now.” Aegon tells Jonathan. “There will be no more talk of the man who tried to steal your mother from me. Do you understand?”  Jonathan nods against his mother’s dress.  “Good” Aegon inhales deeply wrapping them both in his arms. “Welcome home.”  ————————————————————————  “Why are you doing this Aegon?” Y/N asks staring out the window to the garden.  “You were promised to me.” He tosses his chalice against the wall stumbling toward her. “You will marry me. You will love no one but me! That is why Stark is dead that is why his body will hang until only his bones remain.”  “How can you be so cruel?” Y/N cries wrapping both arms tightly around herself.  “This is a kindness my dearest love.” Aegon says draping his arms over hers “in time you will see. You’ve lost your way. But you will learn I will teach you.”  She has to get away. “Please-”  He sneers. “You will do a fair share of begging in our lives together there is no need to start prematurely.”  “What do you want?”  Has he not made it abundantly clear? “You.”  “I am only a woman. You understand that do you not?” Y/N scoffs. “There is nothing I can give you another cannot. Why chase me? Why hunt me down when you could’ve had anyone?”  “I realize we have our differences but there is no other woman capable of evoking such passion in my heart. I love you I loathe you. You frustrate and entice me.” He nips at her neck. “It was always going to be you sooner or late.”  “I had a life Aegon.”  “Now you will have a new life with me.”  ————————————————————————  As days pass Y/N allows her mind to wander. To escape the vessel in which it’s held; far enough that she doesn’t feel. In time it begins drifting farther and farther out to sea.  Aegon plays with Jonathan lifting him high on his shoulders the way her husband used to.   Jonathan takes a liking to him. Anytime he asks about his father he is met with a sigh.  “Do you see that pretender anywhere around here?”   Jon shakes his head.  “And you never will.” Aegon snickers. “There is no need to keep asking as you know it upsets me.”  The boy lowers his eyes “yes father.”  “You are a Targaryen. Not a Stark.” Aegon taps his chin “all of this will be yours one day.”  Aegon is a madman but he does seem to care for them in his own demented way.   Y/N loathes herself for even thinking it.  A few weeks after her belly begins to round with Aegon’s child. Y/N nearly forgets why she is here. Why she has to float away.   Aegon is all but tethered to the tiny bump kissing it each day as it grows.   Jonathan is the only reason Y/N holds onto hope. Though sometimes she can hear his father calling from the garden.  Aegon is speaking to her then plush lips moving over perfect teeth.  It catches her off guard the look of him. A fallen angel cast out by the gods. So like her mother. Y/N desperately misses her mother.  Aegon smiles as she caresses the side of his face ignoring her distant gaze. He knew she would come round eventually.  “Why do you think my mother hasn’t come to see me?” Y/N asks with wide sad eyes.  Oh…you poor poor thing. Aegon kisses her outstretched hand. She does not remember nor does it matter. It’s best not to upset her. “I am sure she will turn up sooner or late my dearest love.”  She believes him she has to.

Many lords whispered that she was far better suited to run someday Bear Island than her brother Lord Rodrik two years her junior who was spoiled hot-tempered and was already rather fond of girls angering the village by lifting the little girls’ (and not so little) skirts.   Soon a raven was sent before her tenth nameday; Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen offered to take Aurynn to her court in exchange for House Mormont’s loyalty and generous gifts. Lady Alys Blackwood Aurynn’s mother and aunt of Samwell Blackwood encored it ordering the best dresses and furs for her daughter of the colours red black and brown: House Targaryen and Mormont’s. With a loyal guard to keep the lady safe Aurynn was shipped to Dragonstone. There she bent the knee and presented the Princess with a precious and heavy necklace which resembled the crown of King Jaehaerys which the princess adored and thanked by kissing each cheek of the strikingly beautiful little girl.   Closest in age to Prince Jacaerys Velaryon they soon became the closest friends and both were devoted to one another and often took on the role of the second parent of Prince Lucerys and Prince Joffrey. When the fight in which Prince Aemond’s eye was lost Mushroom swears that Lady Mormont had punched Daeron in the throat while Maester Glyadyn affirms that she stayed behind soothing Princess Helaena shouting for Laenor or Ser Erryk all in vain. However when questioning came in King Viserys deeming her a neutral party asked her if Aemond had truly called the boys bastards in which she says he did and Aegon and Daeron egged him on. It is said that Lord Mormont demanded a compensation for the trauma his precious Northern Sapphire had gone through. It was Lady Alys and Lady Aurynn herself who soothed her father’s rage and agreed to a coffer of gold and the promise to assign a far more prestigious knight to protect the lady.   While she was not present during Lady Laena’s funeral or Rhaenyra’s wedding to Prince Daemon she was widely vocal about her joy over the marriage even if it was rushed. While it set her at odds with other lords salivating over the widowed princess they said nothing deeming her as a small girl who has read far too many romance books. It did not set her at odds with the princes and ladies Baela and Rhaena to whom she was attached to the hip. They had an overall good childhood and when Vermax was big enough he often took her riding soaring the skies.   However the moment Baela and Jace were betrothed something inside her told her to keep her distance from Jace and he from her. He had told her expecting of her a reaction. She instead simply smiled and congratulated him on the nuptials and closed the door. For a long time she learned to repress her feelings and never once resented Baela for what had been a plain as day Westerosi betrothal among the Great Houses.   However her life would change forevermore the moment Princess Rhaenyra changed the rules of the game by betrothing her to Prince Jacaerys and betrothed Baela to her lord brother Rodrik.   This decision would have consequences that would become key parts of what would be known as the Dance of the Dragons in which Aurynn would take part and survive… at a high price.“,2024-07-14 03:08:04 GMT

I just want some head canons that make me smile.     Here is one I have been holding on to for a while:  Daemon is an incredibly overprotective father but not for any of his blood kids. He is not worried about Rhaena or Baela they are Laena’s daughters it is more likely that they choose their love interest and they will most likely call all the shots.  In contrast Daemon is incredibly worried about Jace Luke and even Joff. They are all so pretty and charming. They take after Rhaenyra so much and while he loves Rhaenyra he knows what she got up to when she was young. He also knows that what happened between him and Rhaenyra when she was young is not something he would want happening to his boys. He absolutely doesn’t want some roguish man coming in and kissing his boys in brothels offering to take them as their spouse.  Daemon has never felt more stressed when his family meets Viserys’ Hightower brats and he sees the way they look at his boys. He has multiple heart attacks when he sees the one eyed brat (Aemond) and the drunk lecher (Aegon) make eyes at his sweet stepsons. He very much wants to take Aemond’s other eye for the way he is looking at Luke and punch Aegon in the mouth for the way he is smirking at Jace. He can’t deal with this he is going to lock his stepsons up on Dragonstone until they are 50 or until the Hightower brats die whichever comes first.  Daemon has never felt like such a hypocrite. He swears that Viserys has somehow orchestrated all of this to get back at him for the brothel incident ….. and possibly the wedding incident too.

14,House of the Dragon,['hotd spoilers'  'maester conspiracy'],nitewolf14,I have a question. Putting aside ether you are team green or team black answer me this. Why the hell werent Allicent’s kids born with brown hair? Aren’t we led to believe brown hair/black hair is supposed to be some kind of dominant gene trait? Is it because Viserys was a pure bred Valyrian and that carried his genes through? This wouldn’t exactly make sense though! Even Rhaenys had black hair and Aemon was a pure Valyrian and he married a Baratheon I’m confused on how this didn’t happen with Allicent as well. Is this all just story convince for the sake of writing a war? Elia Martell had two children by Rhaegar and Rhaenys looked like a Martell while Aegon was reported to look like his father pale hair and all. Aegon the unworthy had VARIOUS children that had various genes when it came to hair skin color and eyes. Rosey the Otherys siblings Aegor Rivers Mya Rivers Brynden Rivers and Gwenys Rivers being examples of some of the children he had. Now don’t get me wrong not all the kids Aegon the unworthy had were described but we DO know at least that bittersteel had purple eyes and black hair. That checks out then we can assume the rest of them were a healthy mix of their parents. Besides the oddball Brynden aka Bloodraven and Shiera who had rare mismatched eyes like Alyssa Targaryen.   Now riddle me this. How is it possible NONE of Alicents kids came out with her coloring yet most of Rhaenyra’s kids did? At the very least some of Alicents kids should have had different eye colors yet there’s no mention of it on the contrary her kids looked like perfect Valyrian children. But…that’s not how genetics work 😭 at least ONE of them should have been the odd one out and some of Rhaenyra’s kids with Harwin should have come out with one of her characteristics in some way. Yet that’s not what happened!   Truthfully 😭 I think the Maesters either lied about the characteristics of the children or they put in false information to make the Targaryen’s to look as bad as possible. Fire and blood was made many centuries after the fact. It would have been so easy to just write out whatever you pleased about how people looked because no one was alive from that time period anymore 🤷🏾‍♀️ everyone around the current timeline in asoiaf would look to this history book as fact with no question because of how trusted they are supposed to be(because we know that the people in the story know of what happened back then. So at the very least the book has been around for a few years. Or at least the accounts of what happened has at any rate)  Sure this could also be writers convince to write out the war but that’s so boring! 🤣 Not to mention there was literally a war dedicated to bastard Targaryens and how they looked!   This was just something that struck a cord in me and I thought it would be something fun to dive into!,2024-07-14 04:53:28 GMT

We were Born to Die Pairing: Aemond Targaryen x Reader   Summary: Princess Y/n The Foreseer and Princess Rhaenys The Queen who never was were chosen to fly to Rook’s Rest.   A/n: It’s just a different ending than the one they actually presented in the show. I just wanted to write something for Aemond. Anyways Thank you for reading!  Note:   Reader is Rhaenys’ granddaughter.  Reader’s dragon is Moonfyre The Nightdream. She was one of the last eggs of Balerion and Dreamfyre. She is only 9 years old during the Dance of the Dragons.  Reader can Foresee glimpses of the future.  __________________ฅ⁠^⁠•⁠ﻌ⁠•⁠^⁠ฅ_______________  Cole and his army were marching towards Rook’s Rest. The council was in distress in the absence of the Queen.   The lords argued with themselves and the Heir to the Throne. Pointing out their views on the matter. Y/n stood beside her brother and Princess Rhaenys.  The council’s bickering halted as the Queen suddenly walked in.  Jacaerys your brother looked very dissatisfied with your mother the Queen. They argued as to who would go to Rook’s Rest.   Your mother volunteered herself which made Jace rage up.   “Send me” Jacaerys said with confidence.  “No” Rhaenyra replied with a sarcastic laugh.  “I will go to Rook’s Rest and wipe Cole’s line and return-”  “You lack the experience.” Rhaenyra stopped Jace’s argument.  “You must send me. Meleys is the second largest dragon you have.” Rhaenys intervened to which Rhaenyra felt speechless.    Rhaenys gave Corlys a smile before leaving the room. A vision flashed before your eyes as your body stilled.   Meleys getting killed.  Rhaenys falling to her death.  There were….. two dragons.  One was Sunfyre you thought you saw… But you couldn’t recognise the other.  Your mother’s calling snapped you out of your vision. You looked panicked. Your mother and brother sensed something wrong.  “Y/n-” Jace reached for you before you said  “Send me as well”   “That cannot be done sweet girl.” Rhaenyra said.   “It must be! Rhaenys- …. I saw her. And Meleys! They were ambushed. There were two dragons! Aegon will come! She cannot go alone! She Will Die!”   Rhaenyra looked shocked at your outburst. She pondered for a while before agreeing.   Moonfyre and Meleys were the largest dragons of the blacks. Rhaenyra trusted her daughter’s judgement.  _________________________________________  As you walked to the Dragon Pit you saw no one. No one dared to come closer to your child. They feared their lives.  Rhaenys had left early. You left an hour after she had left. You doubted if you could catch upto her. Meleys was the fastest dragon.  Moonfyre let out a groan as she flew through the clouds to Rook’s Rest.   Your memories flashed before you. The first time you rode a dragon was with your father. It was Seasmoke.    “Kepa! Soo high! Hehe” little y/n threw her arms up in the air as Seasmoke flew through the clouds huffing proudly.  “Yes. Do you like it? Being here atop the clouds?” Laenor asked his daughter who only giggled and said.  “Yes kepa” laenor smiled and said “If you like we can fly on Seasmoke every now and then. Just don’t tell your mother or i won’t hear the end of it.”  You smiled at the memory. Those times perished very quickly right infront of your eyes.   You could only look ahead now not behind. You may not even make it out alive today. But you’ll die knowing that you tried.  _________________________________________  Meleys tackled Sunfyre in the sky as the roar of another dragon was heard. Larger wings taking off in the sky.  Vhagar had arrived.   “Thank the gods!” Aegon exclaimed before his face turned to horror upon realisation of what was to come.  “Dracarys!” Aemond said  “No! Noo!” Aegon screamed trying to take cover of his dragon. Meleys fled the moment Vhagar breathed fire.  Meleys was away from Vhagar and Sunfyre. Rhaenys felt no hope returning back home. She would fight. She would fight here and die. She closed her eyes and opened them slowly before saying   “Angōs Meleys..”  Meleys turned back to the fight she gave a look to Rhaenys which she reciprocated. Rhaenys tightened her strap and held tighter to the saddle.  Vhagar and Meleys were flying towards each other when suddenly…  A loud roar could be heard…  Moonfyre came out of the clouds. Her size a close match to Vhagar.   She was one of the unhatched egg of Balerion and Dreamfyre before Balerion passed.   “Dracarys!”  All eyes went on the White dragon and her rider as she breathed fire. Vhagar flew away from the fire before she could collide with Meleys.  Rhaenys watched as Moonfyre the 9 year old dragon chased after Vhagar the 180 year old dragon. Both almost equal in size.  “Angōs Moonfyre!” Y/n shouted to her dragon.  Aemond looked back once. He didn’t anticipate that another dragon let alone the dragon of his once betrothed would be coming to Rook’s Rest.  He didn’t turn away and flee. Vhagar turned back and charged towards the Nightdream.   The largest dragons collided with each other. Moonfyre clawed at Vhagar’s wing as the Queen of the Dragons let out a loud wail.  Rhaenys got rid of any of the remaining green soldiers before joining Y/n in her battle.  Y/n grunted as Moonfyre flew away just in time to dodge Vhagar’s attack.   Meleys came in and clawed at Vhagar’s right wing. Tearing away some flesh from her wing.   Aemond knowing he couldn’t win and fled from Rook’s Rest.   Yet amongst all two were completely forgotten…..    Aegon the Usurper and Sunfyre the Golden….  Meleys told y/n that the last she saw them was when Sunfyre crashed near the woods.   Nodding at her grandmother’s word Y/n took off towards the direction of the woods along with Rhaenys.  _________________________________________  Moonfyre and Meleys were just a few feet away.  As you walked through the woods with Rhaenys she drew out her sword for protection.  The two of you saw smoke coming out. Upon a closer look the two of you saw Aegon and Sunfyre.  Aegon’s body partly burned and bent. While Sunfyre’s one wing was almost torn.  Rhaenys and you shared a look before deciding that you both would take Aegon back to Dragonstone.   Sunfyre was smaller than Moonfyre so she could carry the Gold dragon with her feet.  _________________________________________  “Your grace you must calm down-” Corlys tried to reason.  “How can I possibly calm down?! I don’t know if my girl would return safely! I cannot lose another child!” Rhaenyra said her voice raising.  All became silent….  A loud roar was heard. Rhaenyra and the rest ran outside. There they were…  Moonfyre and Meleys.  Rhaenyra squinted her eyes which widened when she saw what came with the dragon riders.   Moonfyre dropped Sunfyre’s body a bit far before landing on the beach.   Y/n came down from Moonfyre as Rhaenys came down from Meleys taking Aegon down with her.  Guards took Aegon’s body away. He would be dealt with afterwards.  Rhaenyra ran and hugged her daughter. She offered Rhaenys a smile and thanked her for protecting her daughter.  Baela ran and hugged y/n as she hid her face in y/n’s neck.  _________________________________________  When night came over Driftmark you stood near the balcony. A letter in your right hand. You turned back to your trusted maid and gave her the letter.  She nodded and quickly left from to room. She was to deliver that letter to the one eyed prince or rather….. The Kinslayer..  You gently took the letter you had received from him that evening in your arms reading it again.   You look up at the sky closing your eyes as Moonfyre soared above the sky your white hair flowing away from your face due to the wind.  The letter which you had received made you question everything. You do love that man even though he killed your brother..   Dear y/n  I didn’t expect to see you today. I realised after today that this war is neither yours nor mine to fight yet we both find ourselves tangled in it.  I wished for the throne because my brother is unfit for it. But I realise now that… I wish for you more. That I need you more than any throne any power.  Aegon will die and so will the other Greens. I know that you would not believe me but I am willing to leave my grudges and be with you.  I need you not some Baratheon girl.  I have realised that you.. and i… We were born to die… together….  That was what the letter stated. You stilled as a vision flashed in your eyes.  Your little brother….. Was it Aegon or was it Viserys? Who ever it was.. looked quite grown up…   He was getting coronated….by Aemond..  You stood beside him and on the opposite side stood Lord Cregan Stark…  You panted as your vision ended eyes regaining their color.   Maybe everything was going to okay after the war ends.. You and Aemond lived.. your brother sat on the throne..you could only hope the rest of the family was okay.  You felt relieved a bit by the vision thinking about the letter you had sent.  It stated that he must accept Rhaenyra as the queen and pledge loyalty to her. If he doesn’t there isn’t any thing you can do. He already took your brother your mother won’t let go of that easily but he could try.  The last line was one of the same lines he wrote to you…..     “You and I …. We were born to Die….”,2024-07-14 06:37:42 GMT

I just want some head canons that make me smile.     Here is one I have been holding on to for a while:  Daemon is an incredibly overprotective father but not for any of his blood kids. He is not worried about Rhaena or Baela they are Laena’s daughters it is more likely that they choose their love interest and they will most likely call all the shots.  In contrast Daemon is incredibly worried about Jace Luke and even Joff. They are all so pretty and charming. They take after Rhaenyra so much and while he loves Rhaenyra he knows what she got up to when she was young. He also knows that what happened between him and Rhaenyra when she was young is not something he would want happening to his boys. He absolutely doesn’t want some roguish man coming in and kissing his boys in brothels offering to take them as their spouse.  Daemon has never felt more stressed when his family meets Viserys’ Hightower brats and he sees the way they look at his boys. He has multiple heart attacks when he sees the one eyed brat (Aemond) and the drunk lecher (Aegon) make eyes at his sweet stepsons. He very much wants to take Aemond’s other eye for the way he is looking at Luke and punch Aegon in the mouth for the way he is smirking at Jace. He can’t deal with this he is going to lock his stepsons up on Dragonstone until they are 50 or until the Hightower brats die whichever comes first.  Daemon has never felt like such a hypocrite. He swears that Viserys has somehow orchestrated all of this to get back at him for the brothel incident ….. and possibly the wedding incident too. At least Daeron is away in Old Town away from Joffrey……… Until Viserys brings him back to the Red Keel to torture his brother. King Viserys has so few amusements and seeing Daemon slowly go bald from seeing these roguish princes of the realm try to seduce his children is the best gift he has ever received. He can die happy now knowing Daemon’s karma has come at last.,2024-07-14 05:55:01 GMT

We were Born to Die Pairing: Aemond Targaryen x Reader   Summary: Princess Y/n The Foreseer and Princess Rhaenys The Queen who never was were chosen to fly to Rook’s Rest.   A/n: It’s just a different ending than the one they actually presented in the show. I just wanted to write something for Aemond. Anyways Thank you for reading!  Note:   Reader is Rhaenys’ granddaughter.  Reader’s dragon is Moonfyre The Nightdream. She was one of the last eggs of Balerion and Dreamfyre. She is only 9 years old during the Dance of the Dragons.  Reader can Foresee glimpses of the future.  __________________ฅ⁠^⁠•⁠ﻌ⁠•⁠^⁠ฅ_______________  Cole and his army were marching towards Rook’s Rest. The council was in distress in the absence of the Queen.   The lords argued with themselves and the Heir to the Throne. Pointing out their views on the matter. Y/n stood beside her brother and Princess Rhaenys.  The council’s bickering halted as the Queen suddenly walked in.  Jacaerys your brother looked very dissatisfied with your mother the Queen. They argued as to who would go to Rook’s Rest.   Your mother volunteered herself which made Jace rage up.   “Send me” Jacaerys said with confidence.  “No” Rhaenyra replied with a sarcastic laugh.  “I will go to Rook’s Rest and wipe Cole’s line and return-”  “You lack the experience.” Rhaenyra stopped Jace’s argument.  “You must send me. Meleys is the second largest dragon you have.” Rhaenys intervened to which Rhaenyra felt speechless.    Rhaenys gave Corlys a smile before leaving the room. A vision flashed before your eyes as your body stilled.   Meleys getting killed.  Rhaenys falling to her death.  There were….. two dragons.  One was Sunfyre you thought you saw… But you couldn’t recognise the other.  Your mother’s calling snapped you out of your vision. You looked panicked. Your mother and brother sensed something wrong.  “Y/n-” Jace reached for you before you said  “Send me as well”   “That cannot be done sweet girl.” Rhaenyra said.   “It must be! Rhaenys- …. I saw her. And Meleys! They were ambushed. There were two dragons! Aegon will come! She cannot go alone! She Will Die!”   Rhaenyra looked shocked at your outburst. She pondered for a while before agreeing.   Moonfyre and Meleys were the largest dragons of the blacks. Rhaenyra trusted her daughter’s judgement.  _________________________________________  As you walked to the Dragon Pit you saw no one. No one dared to come closer to your child. They feared their lives.  Rhaenys had left early. You left an hour after she had left. You doubted if you could catch upto her. Meleys was the fastest dragon.  Moonfyre let out a groan as she flew through the clouds to Rook’s Rest.   Your memories flashed before you. The first time you rode a dragon was with your father. It was Seasmoke.    “Kepa! Soo high! Hehe” little y/n threw her arms up in the air as Seasmoke flew through the clouds huffing proudly.  “Yes. Do you like it? Being here atop the clouds?” Laenor asked his daughter who only giggled and said.  “Yes kepa” laenor smiled and said “If you like we can fly on Seasmoke every now and then. Just don’t tell your mother or i won’t hear the end of it.”  You smiled at the memory. Those times perished very quickly right infront of your eyes.   You could only look ahead now not behind. You may not even make it out alive today. But you’ll die knowing that you tried.  _________________________________________  Meleys tackled Sunfyre in the sky as the roar of another dragon was heard. Larger wings taking off in the sky.  Vhagar had arrived.   “Thank the gods!” Aegon exclaimed before his face turned to horror upon realisation of what was to come.  “Dracarys!” Aemond said  “No! Noo!” Aegon screamed trying to take cover of his dragon. Meleys fled the moment Vhagar breathed fire.  Meleys was away from Vhagar and Sunfyre. Rhaenys felt no hope returning back home. She would fight. She would fight here and die. She closed her eyes and opened them slowly before saying   “Angōs Meleys..”  Meleys turned back to the fight she gave a look to Rhaenys which she reciprocated. Rhaenys tightened her strap and held tighter to the saddle.  Vhagar and Meleys were flying towards each other when suddenly…  A loud roar could be heard…  Moonfyre came out of the clouds. Her size a close match to Vhagar.   She was one of the unhatched egg of Balerion and Dreamfyre before Balerion passed.   “Dracarys!”  All eyes went on the White dragon and her rider as she breathed fire. Vhagar flew away from the fire before she could collide with Meleys.  Rhaenys watched as Moonfyre the 9 year old dragon chased after Vhagar the 180 year old dragon. Both almost equal in size.  “Angōs Moonfyre!” Y/n shouted to her dragon.  Aemond looked back once. He didn’t anticipate that another dragon let alone the dragon of his once betrothed would be coming to Rook’s Rest.  He didn’t turn away and flee. Vhagar turned back and charged towards the Nightdream.   The largest dragons collided with each other. Moonfyre clawed at Vhagar’s wing as the Queen of the Dragons let out a loud wail.  Rhaenys got rid of any of the remaining green soldiers before joining Y/n in her battle.  Y/n grunted as Moonfyre flew away just in time to dodge Vhagar’s attack.   Meleys came in and clawed at Vhagar’s right wing. Tearing away some flesh from her wing.   Aemond knowing he couldn’t win and fled from Rook’s Rest.   Yet amongst all two were completely forgotten…..    Aegon the Usurper and Sunfyre the Golden….  Meleys told y/n that the last she saw them was when Sunfyre crashed near the woods.   Nodding at her grandmother’s word Y/n took off towards the direction of the woods along with Rhaenys.  _________________________________________  Moonfyre and Meleys were just a few feet away.  As you walked through the woods with Rhaenys she drew out her sword for protection.  The two of you saw smoke coming out. Upon a closer look the two of you saw Aegon and Sunfyre.  Aegon’s body partly burned and bent. While Sunfyre’s one wing was almost torn.  Rhaenys and you shared a look before deciding that you both would take Aegon back to Dragonstone.   Sunfyre was smaller than Moonfyre so she could carry the Gold dragon with her feet.  _________________________________________  “Your grace you must calm down-” Corlys tried to reason.  “How can I possibly calm down?! I don’t know if my girl would return safely! I cannot lose another child!” Rhaenyra said her voice raising.  All became silent….  A loud roar was heard. Rhaenyra and the rest ran outside. There they were…  Moonfyre and Meleys.  Rhaenyra squinted her eyes which widened when she saw what came with the dragon riders.   Moonfyre dropped Sunfyre’s body a bit far before landing on the beach.   Y/n came down from Moonfyre as Rhaenys came down from Meleys taking Aegon down with her.  Guards took Aegon’s body away. He would be dealt with afterwards.  Rhaenyra ran and hugged her daughter. She offered Rhaenys a smile and thanked her for protecting her daughter.  Baela ran and hugged y/n as she hid her face in y/n’s neck.  _________________________________________  When night came over Driftmark you stood near the balcony. A letter in your right hand. You turned back to your trusted maid and gave her the letter.  She nodded and quickly left from to room. She was to deliver that letter to the one eyed prince or rather….. The Kinslayer..  You gently took the letter you had received from him that evening in your arms reading it again.   You look up at the sky closing your eyes as Moonfyre soared above the sky your white hair flowing away from your face due to the wind.  The letter which you had received made you question everything. You do love that man even though he killed your brother..   Dear y/n  I didn’t expect to see you today. I realised after today that this war is neither yours nor mine to fight yet we both find ourselves tangled in it.  I wished for the throne because my brother is unfit for it. But I realise now that… I wish for you more. That I need you more than any throne any power.  Aegon will die and so will the other Greens. I know that you would not believe me but I am willing to leave my grudges and be with you.  I need you not some Baratheon girl.  I have realised that you.. and i… We were born to die… together….  That was what the letter stated. You stilled as a vision flashed in your eyes.  Your little brother….. Was it Aegon or was it Viserys? Who ever it was.. looked quite grown up…   He was getting coronated….by Aemond..  You stood beside him and on the opposite side stood Lord Cregan Stark…  You panted as your vision ended eyes regaining their color.   Maybe everything was going to okay after the war ends.. You and Aemond lived.. your brother sat on the throne..you could only hope the rest of the family was okay.  You felt relieved a bit by the vision thinking about the letter you had sent.  It stated that he must accept Rhaenyra as the queen and pledge loyalty to her. If he doesn’t there isn’t any thing you can do. He already took your brother your mother won’t let go of that easily but he could try.  The last line was one of the same lines he wrote to you…..     “You and I …. We were born to Die….”,2024-07-14 06:37:42 GMT

After seeing how everyone treats him especially after that The Red Dragon and the Gold episode I can’t help but pity the guy. And I’ve started rooting for him. At the same time I also root for Rhaenyra. It’s funny how fiction tends to get people to like two characters who are on different sides. Regardless I’m mainly rooting for Rhaenyra and I want Aegon to lose.,2024-07-14 06:35:57 GMT

The writers seem intent on portraying him as clueless and dumb despite in season 1 there is evidence to the contrary.  You have Aemond being harshly questioned by Viserys who at some point menacingly asks him who told him about Rhaenyra’s children being bastards.  Aemond knows that he can’t just throw Alicent under the bus because at least he and his brother are still the king’s kin so he knows nothing will happen to them (which isn’t a guarantee for Alicent despite being the king’s wife) regardless so he blames Aegon.  Now Aegon who is FAR from stupid immediately picks up what his brother might be actually doing without knowing the context (and let’s remember the two don’t have a good relationship at this point and he could simply deny thinking Aemond is trying to put him in trouble to settle a score) and immediately plays along even deflecting the argument to how there is no need to have a planted rumour because it’s plain to see.  Throughout season 1 Aegon repeatedly demonstrates a greater awareness than other characters give him credit for. In the carriage scene he keeps acting skeptical to the news Viserys wanted him as heir but Alicent as usual shuts him down even calling him stupid for doubting her love for him. Well considering how things are going in season 2 he wasn’t really wrong about that either was he?   Season 1 Aegon would have immediately pointed out Alicent’s hypocrisy for trying to diminish him in comparison to his father simply because contrarily to expectations he is not willing to be a mindless puppet like Viserys was. Aegon has already picked up on Otto and Alicent’s real expectations of him. Why would he ask Alicent if she loves him? Because he genuinely doubt that especially now that he is being dragged to wear a crown out of nowhere. Friendly reminder that not being trained and literate doesn’t automatically equate to being stupid.  Additionally portraying episode 2 as Otto’s grand triumph is just completely wrong. Otto who has been manipulating everyone like pieces on a chessboard finally gets booted off by the person he least expected it from. This comes after he shows no respect for his son’s death shamelessly declaring that he will parade his body for the sake of their image as the silent sisters were still sewing his head to his body. But of course god forbid we don’t immediately dumb down everything Aegon does or the audience might start thinking he could actually be a fair competitor for the designated hero of the show.,2024-07-14 08:51:13 GMT
81,House of the Dragon,['hotd spoilers'  'alicent hightower'  'helaena targaryen'  'aegon ii targaryen'],abla-soso,Alicent’s parenting skills are deeply flawed and fucked up. But gosh I adore the fact that she’s a girl mom. Like finally! A toxic mom who prefers a daughter over a son! 🙏  She called Healena “my dearest love” and it absolutely shows.   If the writers don’t fuck it up Healena’s death should be Alicent’s final straw. The truamatic devastating loss that would kill any love she still has for Rhaenyra.,2024-07-14 08:39:49 GMT

En parte porque no querías que nada borrara la sensación de los dedos de tu madre durante las noches en las que ella cuidaba de tu cabello en distintos peinados y masajes que realizaba en la raíz con aceites y cremas que tu abuelo traía desde las ciudades libres hechos de aguacate y coco frutas pocos comunes en Westeros; pero fuera de los recuerdos emotivos estaba el hecho de que ninguna de las damas que fueron llevadas a tu servicio sabía como tratar correctamente tu tipo de cabello sin lastimarlo o empeorarlo; sus dedos trenzaban con demasiada fuerza dejándote el cuero cabelludo irritado por horas incluso cuando el peinado había sido deshecho las cremas que aplicaban en el cabello eran del tipo incorrecto y no quieres mencionar la vez que una de ellas trato de peinarte con un cepillo mientras tenías el cabello seco.  Tu hermana Baela había optado por mantenerlo suelto era más fácil para ella encontrar damas que supieran cuidar de su cabello debido a que conservaba el mismo estilo de cabello que su madre necesitando una definición simple de rizos mientras que Rhaena por otra parte había optado por las mismas rastas que usaba desde niña cuidandolas ella misma cada que su cabello crecía y necesitaba trenzarlo de nuevo haciendo lo mismo contigo una vez que te rendiste y no tuviste más remedio que encontrar una solución sabiendo que no podrías descuidar por mucho tiempo tu propio cabello. En ocaciones verte en espejos era algo que te hacía sentir tristeza con tu madre fallecida tu abuelo demasiado lejos en viajes y la gestión de su hogar y tu padre de cabello lacio ya no había posibilidad de tener aquellos moñitos que Laena te hacía cuando eras pequeña o las trenzas de caja que habías decidido a usar pocos meses antes de su muerte.  Jacaerys fue quien había indagado sobre esto luego de haberse enterado del compromiso que su madre y Daemon habían arreglado entre ustedes preguntando mediante cuervos hacía sus abuelos siendo Rhaenys quien le enviaba cartas extensas del paso a paso de como trenzar correctamente sin lastimarte o dañar tu cabello y Corlys enviando distintos aceites peines y cepillos adecuados para usar en ti. El príncipe heredero casi se infarta cuando al llegar a tus aposentos durante la noche queriendo cuidar de tu cabello comenzaste a llorar mientras lo abrazabas conmovida por su gesto.  Las visitas durante la noche se hicieron cada vez más frecuente aprovechando las horas en las que ninguno tenía deberes que demandaban com urgencia su atención pero comenzó a levantar rumores que llegaron a oídos de tu padre y tu madrastra quienes no hicieron más que sonreír cuando al espiar ligeramente solo te encontraron sentada frente al espejo de tus aposentos con Jacaerys parado detrás de ti con el ceño fruncido en una mueca de concentración sosteniendo con su boca un peine de cardar mientras sus dedos trataban de ser menos torpes a la hora de trenzar tu cabello.,2024-07-14 08:14:52 GMT

There’s now a companion Cinderella retelling for Aeron Bracken called Star Crossed   Warnings: swearing threat of violence female reader world jumping reader Frenemies to lovers vibes lengthy (I got carried away whoops) Beauty &amp; The Beast vibes.   Y/N woke with a jolt. Dazed her eyes frantically tried to take in her surroundings. She was disturbed to find she was not in her own bed but lying on the cold hard ground with ferns lightly tickling her face. She seemed to have fallen asleep in the middle of nowhere not recognising any land marks just the vast expanse of green fields rocky paths and off in the distance the treeline of nearby woodland. She remembered she’d been hiking and come across a strange arch covered in interweaving vines and blood red roses so dark they were almost black. She had felt inexplicably drawn to the arch that seemed to crackle with magic. But she knew that was ridiculous there was no such thing. And yet she found herself walking towards it as if pulled by some invisible force until she stepped through it…and was met with darkness.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Y/N was pulled back to the present by an intense feeling of panic. None of this made any sense. Nonetheless her survival instincts had kicked in and she knew she couldn’t just linger out in the open she had to find help. So she started forward opting to avoid the eery treeline of the woods hoping that she’d eventually come across some semblance of civilisation even better someone who could help her make sense of what had happened to her.   Y/N felt like she’d been walking for hours perhaps she had her bones wearied with exertion. A shining ray of hope came in the form of a beautiful man sat atop a precarious pile of stones. He struck a princely figure dressed in clothes that looked straight out of a medieval fair a fake sword hanging from a belt at his hips. His soft brown hair lanky limbs and dimples gave him a boyish charm. But his broad shoulders were suggestive of a strong build and the small scar on his nose gave her the impression he’d once broken it perhaps in a fight. Eyes suddenly snapping to hers his features rearranged themselves into a cocky smirk and she suddenly felt quite strongly that the man in front of her was quietly dangerous.   Unfolding himself from his slouched position almost that of a beleaguered sentry he jauntily approached her. Although he did stay at a respectful distance of a few paces. “Good day my lady I have not seen you around these parts before. And I admit I do not recognise the colours of your house. From where do you hail?” Y/N found herself scoffing at his roguish tone and bizarre speech pattern. “From where do I hail? Are you heading to an expo or something. What’s with the cosplay and fake sword?” The man’s handsome features pulled into a slight frown of confusion. It lasted a mere moment before his eyes were oncemore alight with a mischievous glimmer that Y/N found equal parts frightening and exciting.  “Do you jest my lady? I bear the sigil and colours of House Blackwood as is my prerogrative as Lord of Raventree Hall.” He bowed his head to her a hand to his heart. Y/n had to admire his commitment to his costume but it was starting to grate on her nerves that he seemed to talk in riddles when she was desperate for answers. “Right sure you are. Could you please point me in the direction of the nearest town?” Y/n asked awkwardly hoping to try her luck with someone not dressed like a knight. “You do not know where you are my lady?”   “Not exactly. Not at all if I’m being honest. I sort of just walked through an arch and woke up in a field and here I am. Where exactly is here?” The man’s eyebrows shot up in surprise and Y/N detected a trace of concern as his eyes appeared to soften. “You tell a strange tale my lady and I should be pleased to assist you in any way I can. We are in the heart of the Riverlands in Blackwood land.” Y/N felt a fresh surge of panic rise up within her chest as she struggled to understand any of the unfamiliar words the man in front of her had just laced together. Had she somehow time travelled and that was the cause of their mutual confusion? Trying to maintain a semblance of calm she took a deepth breath through her nose. “Can you tell me what the year is?”   The man’s lips turned up in an amused smile. “This close to the borders of Bracken land it depends who you ask. In the eyes of House Blackwood it is the first year of the reign of the true Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen the 129th year after Aegon the conqueror’s conquest.” Y/N let out a high pitched squeek the panic that had settled uncomfortably in her stomach finally bubbling up to breaking point as she began to realise she may be farther from home than she’d first realised. The young man seemed positively alarmed at her outburst his eyes widening as she started taking small steps away from him all the while trying to regulate her frantic breathing. His brow furrowing he started to close the small distance between them a placating hand outstretched as if he expected her to run from him.   “My lady I can see that you are distressed. If I have done or said something to alarm you I assure you it was not my intention.” Y/N told herself to snap out of it. This was likely all some big misunderstanding. That or the stricken looking man in front of her was toying with her. The idea that he would do such a thing when she was so clearly lost confused and vulnerable incensed her. Glaring at him she wordlessly turned on her heels to walk away from him at break neck speed. Hearing footsteps she glanced behind her to see him following at a distance. “Are you following me?” “Yes” He said simply as if it was perfectly obvious that he should. “Brazen bastard” she mumbled unfortunately not low enough for him to miss. A look of surprise as he registered her insult quickly shifted to one of bemusement before Y/N could even begin to worry about him reacting badly. “That may be but I’d rather not see you walk into a den of savages. And that is the direction you’re going in.”   Y/n was quite frankly sick of his cryptic messages at this point. Stopping in her tracks to face him the young man immediately halted mirroring her movements. She fixed him with a stern glare. “I don’t know what you’re playing at but it isn’t funny. I have no idea what you’re talking about. And I’m not a lady so you can drop the act.”   Turning so quickly she was sure her hair must have whipped him in the face she continued on the path she’d chosen. If he wanted to drop mysterious messages of foreboding without telling her anything concrete she’d just as well ignore him. That turned out to be difficult as he resumed following her wordlessly. Y/N broke the silence a while later. “Why are you still following me? I thought you said I was going the wrong way. Headed towards savages as you put it?” Seemingly delighted that she’d finally looked at him and was willingly speaking to him he shot her a dazzling smile that almost softened her resolve to be irritated with him. “To protect you of course. I am a knight and you are a lady in distress. The course you set is a dangerous one but if you choose to walk it then I shall walk it with you.” His smile did not match the promise of life-threatening danger he was suggesting.  “I can take care of myself and since I can’t understand half of what you’re saying I’m not sure I really believe you.” His smile growing wider the young man took a couple of steps towards Y/N to close the distance between between them before gently taking her hand and planting a kiss to her knuckles. “I don’t doubt it fair lady you seem seem have a will of steel but I’d rather not risk your safety if its all the same to you.” Momentarily at a loss for words at his actions Y/N quickly quashed the traitorous fluttering of her heart and cleared her throat as she pulled her hands from his and attempted to put him down gently. “That’s quite enough of that. Look I appreciate your concern… ” she stopped realising she didn’t know his name and looked up at him questioning. “Benjicot Blackwood. Might I Iearn the name of the fair lady in return?” Ignoring his question Y/N went on “but there’s really no need to worry. I’ll be just fine on my own.”  Once again Y/N turned from him and continued to walk towards whatever mythical danger the man had portended. When she didn’t hear his footfalls following her immediately a smile of self-satisfaction ghosted onto her face before she realised she was almost dissapointed. That was until she heard them at a farther distance this time. Glancing behind her but this time not stopping she shouted back to him. “Are you still following me” He had to shout too for her to hear him though there was mirth in his tone “yes my lady you still seem dead set on barrelling head first into danger. And you have not yet given me your name” he responded playfully. Y/N groaned audibly “Why can’t you go bother some other poor girl and leave me alone?” Y/N fumed to hear him laugh. “Because then fair one I might actually have to bother as you say ladies who like my company. And where would be the fun in that when I have you to shout at me?”   Y/n gaped at him in disbelief this man could not be serious. Shaking her head at him she decided to just go back to ignoring him. Perhaps he’d get bored of following her or if she was really lucky fall into a ditch. They walked a little while longer before an arm suddenly shot out around her waist the young man having hastened his steps to step in front of her. “A step further and we’re in Bracken territory. I beseech you to turn back with me. I will take you to my halls and we can discuss your predicament further.” Y/N felt a growing sense of fear at Benjicot’s seriousness.  Perhaps she’d been too quick to write his warnings off. No sooner had she thought this than she heard approaching footsteps and spotted four other men dressed just like him except for the golden colour of their cloaks where his was a deep red. She didn’t like the angry looks on their faces and was ashamed to find herself cowering slightly. Taking in her fright the young man shot around and positioned himself more fully in front of her arm lightly outstretched behind him as if to shield her.   “Get back from the border Blackwood you’re in breech of the assize.”  “Fuck the assize. This is Blackwood land and you know it.” Y/N didn’t have a clue what the two men were arguing about as insults flew back and forth but her ears perked up as the man closest to her red knight levied the next one at her. “Take her with you. Is she fucking stupid or is she so bold to think she can waltz around wherever she likes? Typical Blackwood bitch.” The Lord of Raventree as he’d called himself earlier snarled out a reply stepping forward to shove the golden Knight harshly in the chest. “You craven bastard. You dare insult a lady under my protection?” Y/N should have been panicking at the impending threat of violence but her anger at the man’s insults so blatantly laced with misogyny rose up so fiercely that she heard her own voice among the din before she could stop it. “Don’t you dare call me a bitch. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? I don’t know anything about an assize or why you’re so obsessed with rocks and not crossing them but you can’t just go around calling people names. Have some respect.”   Seemingly stunned into silence perhaps not expecting her to challenge him so brazenly the golden Knight just stared at her in stony silence for a few moments before ignoring her entirely and turning back to her red knight. “Control your woman Blackwood.” Through gritted teeth Benjicot bit back “Speak another word about the lady and there will be violence.” The golden Knight drew his sword pointing directly at her red knight’s chest. Ok so not a fake sword then. Surprising her by laughing tauntingly Benjicot walked right up to the tip of the sword. “You wouldn’t dare.” Y/N told herself she shouldn’t find his passionate defence of her attractive but in the current circumstances she felt she could be forgiven for being irrational. “Come on just leave it” one of the other golden knights piped up. After a tense few moments the golden cloaked man lowered his sword and and stalked away followed by his friends.   Shoulders tense her defender did not turn his back to the knights until they were out of sight before turning around to look at her eyes immediately softening from the aggressive glare he’d just been fronting. “Are you alright my lady? I had hoped to avoid such an interaction.” Y/N flip flopped between finding his evident concern sweet and being irritated that he seemed to think this was her fault for not listening to him. “You think I’m to blame then? You’re the one who kept dropping veiled hints about my impending doom and refusing to clarify what you meant!” Y/N could not for the life of her understand why the infuriating man in front of her was smiling at her. “Why are you smiling at me? Do you enjoy fighting with me?” “You mistake me my lady. I am merely gratified to know that you are well enough to shout at me. I was concerned that you would be shaken and frightened.”    When Y/N didn’t respond mouth opening and closing trying to find a response Benjicot assumed that she must be in some state of shock after all. “Please allow me to take you to Raventree. It would go against my conscience to leave a lady wandering about the riverlands alone when you seem so confused.” With that he held his arm out for her to take an antiquated gesture that seemed to confirm to Y/N she was really not in kansas anymore. Weighing her options she considered that Benjicot Blackwood had teased her and followed her but he had not harmed her and had in fact protected her when he could have walked away. Making her decision she lightly placed her arm on his. “My name is Y/N.” Benjicot grinned at her as if she had given him a star rather than her name placing his other hand atop hers as it rested on his arm and began directing them in the opposite direction “a beautiful name for a beautiful lady.” Blushing fiercely with embarrassment Y/N squeeked out a “Thank you.”  Benjicot must have been chasing Y/N around the Riverlands for quite some time as it took them at least an hour to reach the impressive fortress he called Raventree Hall.      Once she’d gotten over the initial shock of realising she had in fact jumped from her world into another Y/N actually found herself settling in to life in Westeros. It had taken some convincing for Benjicot to believe her story and stop assuming she was mildly insane but he had all the while insisted she stay with him in Raventree Hall gifting her with her own room and beautiful gowns in the colours of House Blackwood. She’d only had her hiking gear on when she was unceremoniously plucked from her world into his and she sought to avoid similar looks of curiosity to the one he’d shot her when they first met. Y/N grew to love Raventree and the people who lived there.   Benjicot had practically forced his friendship open her and as incorrigible and cocky as he could be encouraging a healthy back and forth banter between them at all times she could not be anything but grateful for it. Each day he would show her something new always hoping to amuse her whether it be a new room to explore in his ancestral halls a book he thought she might like or the rose garden tucked away in the grounds which had become her favourite haunt.    The roses reminded Y/N of Beauty and the Beast her favourite fairytale from back home which Benjicot had made her tell at least a hundred times listening just as attentively a hand cupping his chin and eyes never leaving hers each time. She supposed that her own situation did somewhat resemble her favourite tale down to her very own castle and beast. Benjicot had always been a gentleman with her but she had heard the stories of Bloody Ben whispered by his servants and seen first hand his willingness to resort to violence to protect her when they first met.   More often than not it was Benjicot or Benji as he seemed to insist only she call him who came to her always seeking out her opinions. But today it was Y/N seeking him out. She’d been growing more and more homesick of late and wanted to be with the one person she felt could truly understand eventually finding him in the armoury wielding his sword in different formations. Hoping to sneak up on him and having taken fencing lessons herself back in her own world she quietly tiptoed over to the swords. Grabbing the lightest one she could she walked soundlessly back over to him before he suddenly turned and clashed his sword against hers. “Sorry Y/N but you should know that I’d recognise your footfalls anywhere and you’re not as quiet as you think.”  “Rude” she huffed back sliding her sword down his and shoving him away from her. He grinned at the challenge. “You didn’t mention you’d handled a sword before.” “Only a little.”   He parried a fresh blow from her easily blocking the next.   “I can see that” He teased earning a snarl from her though it did not have any true aggression behind it. He continued to block her blows but seemed reluctant to attack and she used this reticence against him to lunge and place her sword close enough to his neck to refute any delusions he had about her lack of skill. But he was prepared for this and swung his sword upwards to block her again before taking hold of her waist and spinning her around her back hitting his chest. His sword hand wove around around her shoulders as he kept the blade at a distance from her body while Benji gently trailed his other hand down the side of her bodice his touch feather light and searing all at once. He leant down to whisper in her ear “You left yourself open here when you lunged.”   Y/N had always found Benjicot attractive even when he teased and irritated her but she’d tried to quash any romantic feelings for him so as not to ruin their friendship. But his closeness to her now her body pressed against his was intoxicating and she struggled to think coherently. Suddenly releasing her Benjicot smiled widely and bowed. “I shall see you later my lady I am off to attend to my duties.” Throwing his sword carelessly over his shoulder he turned and exited the armoury leaving Y/N to stew over the unwelcome feelings their impromptu sword fight had brought to the fore.   Later that night Y/n could not help the wave of sadness that threatened to crush her under the weight of it from sending her into a spiral of homesickness. Soft sniffles and sobs echoed about the room as she tried to square the new life she now loved with her feelings of guilt over leaving her family behind. The rattling of her bedroom door knob sent her flying from her bed in alarm as she quickly grabbed a small blade form the wooden desk and hurried to conceal herself behind the door. As the intruder entered she wildly swung around to jab the point of her dagger into their ribcage. The intruder stiffened and she looked up to se that it was just Benji whose brow was quirked up in amusement. How could he act so nonchalant about her nearly spearing him like a fish?   “What’s so funny? I nearly gutted you!”  “With a letter opener?” She looked down to find that what she’d thought was a dagger was indeed just a letter opener not likely to do much damage. She forced out a laugh that ended up sounding much more like a sob and Benji’s face immediately fell once he took in her tearstained appearance fully. Y/N couldn’t bear his look of concern certain it would just make her cry harder and so she broke the silence. “What brings you to my room at this time of night anyway to give me the opportunity to spear you in the first place?” She’d hoped to diffuse the tension and make him laugh but his expression remained just as serious eyes filled with worry. “I heard you crying.”  “Oh.” He had come to check that she was OK. His gentle concern for her sent forth a fresh wave of tears and when Benji opened his arms to her she immediately fell into them her forehead hitting his chest as his hand came up to stroke her hair in a comforting gesture. “What ails you my lady. Whatever you need I will see it done.”   His kindness only made her crying worse and he kissed her sweetly on the crown of her head rubbing soothing circles along her spine. “I miss my family and my home.” Benji stiffened as if he were expecting a blow but he let her continue. “And mostly I feel guilty that I’m not sure I even want to go home. Truthfully I love Raventree and your friendship has meant everything to me.”   Benji took hold of Y/N’s elbows and lightly pushed her away from his chest so he could look into her eyes. “It gladdens my heart to hear that you feel this way about my home. I should like you to consider it your home too. You will always have a place here with me.” Kissing her forehead tenderly he held Y/N’s head against his heart again as if she were made of glass or something truly precious to him he was scared to break. Little did she know how true this was.   Weeks later Y/N found that her homesickness had begun to dissipate to a dull ache. But her feelings for Benji had grown and spread like the vines of the rose bushes she loved so much wild and uncontainable. It was difficult to even be in his presence without wanting him to touch her and hold her as he had the night he’d found her crying.   Sitting with her in what he’d come to refer to as her rose garden he kept shooting furtive glances at her as she read from a tome on his house history. “Why are you staring at me?” “I’m not?” “Try that again without the question mark”   Benjicot surprised her shifting in his spot next to her to turn to her fully their knees touching before taking both of her hands in his. “I have not been able to look away from you for more than a few moments ever since I first laid eyes on you. I must admit that I am desperately in love with you and wondered if by some chance of fate you might feel the same way?”   Y/N’s jaw fell open in shock. “ You love me?”  He squeezed her hands “most ardently.”  Her mind spinning she threw caution to the wind and flung her arms around Benji’s shoulders to kiss him. He reacted instantly pulling her as close towards him as possible until she was in his lap his hands grasping at her hips to pull her closer still as if he couldn’t believe she was real.   Breaking the kiss for oxygen Benji began to trail a line of kisses down Y/N’s neck leaving her breathless one hand pressing her back closer to him. “I wish you to be my wife to become the Lady of Raventree Hall and House Blackwood.”  Butterflies erupted in her stomach.   “Future Lady Blackwood am I?”  “Should you permit it I will protect you cherish you and love you for the remainder of my days or for as long as you will allow. I humbly offer myself to you as your husband with all the love I possess for you.”  “And what if I disagree with you and challenge you. What if we argue constantly?”  “We do not argue my love you scold me and I listen” He shot back with a playful grin.   “And if I decide to change all the tapestries pink?”  Benji sighed tilting his head to her eye level so she could read the sincerity in his eyes.   “I want all of you including your thoughts and opinions. They’re what made me fall in love with you. I want you to share them with me even if they challenge mine especially then even when I hold you in my arms. As to the tapestries I’m rather partial to my house colours but I would try to bear the change if it would please you.”   Y/N giggled at that before planting a tender kiss to his lips. “Then I consent to be be your wife and Lady. You can’t take it back though. You’re stuck with me now.”   Benji pressed their foreheads together cupping the sides of her face to brush her lips with his. “And how grateful I am for it.” He spoke against them before pressing his lips to hers in a kiss he hoped expressed his undying devotion to his lady.     A face I’d go to war for. The title is based on the line ‘love is like the wild rose-briar’ from an Emily Bronte poem I love called Love and Friendship.,2024-07-14 09:20:09 GMT

227,House of the Dragon,['aegon ii targaryen'  'alicent hightower'  'aemond targaryen'  'hotd critical'  'hotd'  'anti hotd'  'stop trying to make aegon look like a clueless idiot'  "he isn't"],chemicalreal,Rewatching episode 1x07 in light of recent events makes Alicent and Aemond’s interactions with Aegon even more frustrating to watch. The writers seem intent on portraying him as clueless and dumb despite in season 1 there is evidence to the contrary.  You have Aemond being harshly questioned by Viserys who at some point menacingly asks him who told him about Rhaenyra’s children being bastards.  Aemond knows that he can’t just throw Alicent under the bus because at least he and his brother are still the king’s kin so he knows nothing will happen to them (which isn’t a guarantee for Alicent despite being the king’s wife) regardless so he blames Aegon.  Now Aegon who is FAR from stupid immediately picks up what his brother might be actually doing without knowing the context (and let’s remember the two don’t have a good relationship at this point and he could simply deny thinking Aemond is trying to put him in trouble to settle a score) and immediately plays along even deflecting the argument to how there is no need to have a planted rumour because it’s plain to see.  Throughout season 1 Aegon repeatedly demonstrates a greater awareness than other characters give him credit for. In the carriage scene he keeps acting skeptical to the news Viserys wanted him as heir but Alicent as usual shuts him down even calling him stupid for doubting her love for him. Well considering how things are going in season 2 he wasn’t really wrong about that either was he?   Season 1 Aegon would have immediately pointed out Alicent’s hypocrisy for trying to diminish him in comparison to his father simply because contrarily to expectations he is not willing to be a mindless puppet like Viserys was. Aegon has already picked up on Otto and Alicent’s real expectations of him. Why would he ask Alicent if she loves him? Because he genuinely doubt that especially now that he is being dragged to wear a crown out of nowhere. Friendly reminder that not being trained and literate doesn’t automatically equate to being stupid.  Additionally portraying episode 2 as Otto’s grand triumph is just completely wrong. Otto who has been manipulating everyone like pieces on a chessboard finally gets booted off by the person he least expected it from. This comes after he shows no respect for his son’s death shamelessly declaring that he will parade his body for the sake of their image as the silent sisters were still sewing his head to his body. But of course god forbid we don’t immediately dumb down everything Aegon does or the audience might start thinking he could actually be a fair competitor for the designated hero of the show.,2024-07-14 08:51:13 GMT
81,House of the Dragon,['hotd spoilers'  'alicent hightower'  'helaena targaryen'  'aegon ii targaryen'],abla-soso,Alicent’s parenting skills are deeply flawed and fucked up. But gosh I adore the fact that she’s a girl mom. Like finally! A toxic mom who prefers a daughter over a son! 🙏  She called Healena “my dearest love” and it absolutely shows.   If the writers don’t fuck it up Healena’s death should be Alicent’s final straw. The truamatic devastating loss that would kill any love she still has for Rhaenyra.,2024-07-14 08:39:49 GMT

En parte porque no querías que nada borrara la sensación de los dedos de tu madre durante las noches en las que ella cuidaba de tu cabello en distintos peinados y masajes que realizaba en la raíz con aceites y cremas que tu abuelo traía desde las ciudades libres hechos de aguacate y coco frutas pocos comunes en Westeros; pero fuera de los recuerdos emotivos estaba el hecho de que ninguna de las damas que fueron llevadas a tu servicio sabía como tratar correctamente tu tipo de cabello sin lastimarlo o empeorarlo; sus dedos trenzaban con demasiada fuerza dejándote el cuero cabelludo irritado por horas incluso cuando el peinado había sido deshecho las cremas que aplicaban en el cabello eran del tipo incorrecto y no quieres mencionar la vez que una de ellas trato de peinarte con un cepillo mientras tenías el cabello seco.  Tu hermana Baela había optado por mantenerlo suelto era más fácil para ella encontrar damas que supieran cuidar de su cabello debido a que conservaba el mismo estilo de cabello que su madre necesitando una definición simple de rizos mientras que Rhaena por otra parte había optado por las mismas rastas que usaba desde niña cuidandolas ella misma cada que su cabello crecía y necesitaba trenzarlo de nuevo haciendo lo mismo contigo una vez que te rendiste y no tuviste más remedio que encontrar una solución sabiendo que no podrías descuidar por mucho tiempo tu propio cabello. En ocaciones verte en espejos era algo que te hacía sentir tristeza con tu madre fallecida tu abuelo demasiado lejos en viajes y la gestión de su hogar y tu padre de cabello lacio ya no había posibilidad de tener aquellos moñitos que Laena te hacía cuando eras pequeña o las trenzas de caja que habías decidido a usar pocos meses antes de su muerte.  Jacaerys fue quien había indagado sobre esto luego de haberse enterado del compromiso que su madre y Daemon habían arreglado entre ustedes preguntando mediante cuervos hacía sus abuelos siendo Rhaenys quien le enviaba cartas extensas del paso a paso de como trenzar correctamente sin lastimarte o dañar tu cabello y Corlys enviando distintos aceites peines y cepillos adecuados para usar en ti. El príncipe heredero casi se infarta cuando al llegar a tus aposentos durante la noche queriendo cuidar de tu cabello comenzaste a llorar mientras lo abrazabas conmovida por su gesto.

1,House of the Dragon,['inspiration'  'hotd'],lionspawfic,Timeline (Guesstimation) The show really messed with ages and some events mainly choosing the 9th year of Viserys’s reign to be 172 years before the birth of Daenrys but keeping the Great Council in 101 and smooshing the ages of Alicent/Rhaenyra’s kids together as well as their own ages. I’ve come up with a speculative timeline of events. Though some are currently complete guesstimations that I’ll update if we ever get more information. I am watching the show again and noting down any specific time mentioned or ages as I go.  Rhaenys and Viserys’s starting ages are largely estimated as well. This timeline isn’t a hard “correct” one but one I’m working on and using for fanfic purposes. I do have a thought process behind all of my guesses though.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Timeline  99 AC  Daemon Targaryen is born to Baelon and Alyssa Targaryen.*  101 AC  The Great Council occurs where fourteen claims were heard. The two serious claims were Viserys I Targaryen (Eldest Son of Baelong Jaehaerys’s 2nd Son) against Rhaenys Targaryen (Only Child of Aemon Jaehaerys’s Eldest Son). Aemma (14) is pregnant at the time. Jaehaerys decrees that Viserys Targaryen (16) would inherit the throne instead of his elder cousin Rhaenys (19).  111 AC  Aemma (24) and Viserys Targaryen (26) welcome their only living child Rhaenyra Targaryen into the world.  126 AC (9th Year of the Reign of Viserys I Targaryen)  Aemma Targaryen is pregnant once more.  Rhaenyra Targaryen (14) is the Realm’s Delight and Viserys and Aemma’s only living child. Her best friend is Alicent Hightower (15). Daemon Targaryen (27) is the Young Prince and current heir who was half raised by his elder brother and goodsister.  Aemma goes into labor and dies along with her son Baelon.  Six months later Rhaenyra has turned (15) in this time and Alicent (15) has been spending time with Viserys (41). Laena (12) was suggested as a match first.  Criston Cole (23) is selected by Rhaenyra as the newest member of the Kingsguard.  Viserys I Targaryen (41) announces he will marry Alicent Hightower (15).  127 AC  Viserys and Alicent marry and soon after she becomes pregnant.  Aegon II Targaryen is born to Alicent Hightower (16) and Viserys Targaryen (42).  129 AC  The War in the Stepstones (I) has been going on almost three years. Laenor (15) is also participating.  Aegon II Targaryen’s second name day celebration occurs in the Kingswoods. Queen Alicent (18) is already heavily pregnant with Helaena. Rhaenyra Targaryen is still only 17 but preparing to turn 18.  130 AC  After months of planning and the birth of Helaena Targaryen Rhaenyra (19) heads out on her search for a husband with Criston Cole (27) her sworn protector. Rhaenyra abandons it a couple months in after being unsatisfied and with two months left to go. It has been a year since the name day and planning everything during this period.  Rhaenyra returns home via boat as Daemon arrives back from the Stepstones.  Alicent has two children at this point Aegon (3) and Helaena (a little less – 1).  In one day in the Capital there is a party welcoming Daemon back Daemyra sneaking out and Rhaenyra getting ruined followed by a morning after that includes banishing Daemon (30) back to Rhea firing Otto after Alicent (19) has a stern talk with her stepdaughter (19) and Viserys telling Rhaenyra she’s going to marry Laenor (16). Within a week Alicent has found out about Rhaenyra lying from Larys and Viserys convinced the Velaryons to agree to the marriage.  The royal wedding is planned.  (I will say there is a few month time skip say two because that’s the minimum for planning a royal wedding and the lords and ladies managing to arrive across Westeros.)  131 AC  Daemon has snuck back to the Vale and murdered his super-hot wife who deserved better and back to King’s Landing in time for the wedding.  The first day of the festivities dawn with Alicent (20) wearing a dramatic green dress Laenor’s (17) boyfriend Joffrey Lonmouth being murdered by Criston Cole (27/28) and Rhaenyra (19) and Laenor (17) getting married.  Laena (17) flirts with Daemon (30/31) during the wedding.  Both Rhaenyra and Alicent are pregnant soon and give birth before the end of the year (based off Jace’s actual birth in the books and speculating about Aemond).  Rhaenyra (20) and Laenor (17) have “their” first child Jacaerys Velaryon who looks like Harwin Strong Rhaenyra’s friend and Commander of the City Guard.  Alicent (20) and Viserys (46) have their third child Aemond Targaryen.  Laena and Daemon have begun courting and/or married in the meantime and leave Westeros at a time unclear.  132 AC  Baela and Rhaena are born to Laena Velaryon (18) and Daemon Targaryen (32).  133 AC  Alicent** and Rhaenyra are pregnant together once more.  Alicent Hightower (22) gives birth to her final child Daeron.  Rhaenyra Targaryen (22) gives birth to Lucerys Velaryon.  141 AC  Daeron Targaryen (8) is sent to Oldtown to be a ward.***  Rhaenyra (30) gives birth to Joffrey Velaryon.  Aegon (14) Jacaerys (10) and Lucerys (8) prank Aemond (10) with “the Pink Dread”.  Laena Velaryon (27) commits suicide by Vhagar’s fire when the birth of her third child is revealed to be deadly.  Aemond (10) loses an eye when he fight Jacaerys (10) Baela and Rhaena (9) and Lucerys (8).  Daemon and Rhaenyra marry within a week of Laena and Laenor’s deaths.  143 AC  Aegon (16) and Helaena (13) are forced to marry.  147 AC  Lucerys (14) has his right to inherit Driftmark challenged.  Aegon II Targaryen (20) and Rhaenyra I Targaryen (36) both succeed their father upon his death. The Dance of the Dragons starts.  Late Fall/Winter is starting.  Current Ages: Rhaenyra/Alicent (36) Daemon (48) Rhaenys (65) Viserys (62) Aegon the Elder (20) Helaena (17) Jacaerys/Aemond (16) Baela/Rhaena (15) Lucery/Daeron (14) Joffrey (6) Aegon the Younger (?)**** Viserys the Younger (?)****  *Speculation based off Daemon’s apparent youth in the show. Ages are unclear so I am just trying to make sense of them. I am basing Daemon’s birth mostly off how old he is supposed to be when he dies which is 49.  **Speculation as Daeron’s age is still unclear in the show.  ***Speculation as I am trying to account for some large change that could make Alicent hostile again when according to Laenor things had settled down. Daeron being sent away potentially against her wishes may account for this especially if she believes Rhaenyra had some factor in the decision.  ****Still working on getting Aegon the Younger and Viserys the Younger figured out as I am part of the way through my rewatch.,2024-07-14 10:42:05 GMT
111,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'writer ezran'],sylasthegrim,This morning I was informed that @4kisses also known as @prongsio had lifted an Aegon oneshot from me. Their since then deleted fic “Silent Love” heavily lifted from mine “Silence is the Beginning of Hell”.  Upon reading it and having it read by a handful of other writers I confirmed that the plot was identical and the scenes were the same just rewritten but in the same order. Some of the dialogues were straight-up copy/paste with simply some pronouns or contractions switched.   Here are some side by side comparisons. In orange is their fic in blue is mine.      There is more but I want to keep the post short.   I reached our to the person but they refused to admit they took from me and promptly blocked me when I presented them with screenshots.   Watch out fellow writers. PLEASE DO NOT SEND HATE TO THAT PERSON. This is simply meant to inform and warn.   DMs with them below the cut.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Then I started to send them the screenshots with the highlighted part but they blocked me without a word.   I wouldn’t have said anything publicly if they had only admitted to it… but since they can’t take accountability I am warning others with proof. I don’t want them to do the same to others.   The fic is probably still available since a dozen people had reblogged it.,2024-07-14 10:30:44 GMT

Throw in an incorrigible but undeniably handsome boy called Benjicot Blackwood who won’t stop following Y/N around and we have ourselves a regular ol’ fairytale.  Disclaimer: Victoria here to interrupt my regularly scheduled Aeron Bracken content with a Benjicot oneshot. This doesn’t have any connection with Elizabeth’s masterpiece The Blackwood Knight but is an attempt to fulfill a request from @ithilwen-blackwood for a modern reader finding themselves in Westeros. I’m sorry it doesn’t match the request exactly as the reader isn’t a dragon rider in this.  Loosely based on Beauty &amp; The Beast. There’s now a companion Cinderella retelling for Aeron Bracken called Star Crossed   Warnings: swearing threat of violence female reader world jumping reader Frenemies to lovers vibes lengthy (I got carried away whoops) Beauty &amp; The Beast vibes.   Y/N woke with a jolt. Dazed her eyes frantically tried to take in her surroundings. She was disturbed to find she was not in her own bed but lying on the cold hard ground with ferns lightly tickling her face. She seemed to have fallen asleep in the middle of nowhere not recognising any land marks just the vast expanse of green fields rocky paths and off in the distance the treeline of nearby woodland. She remembered she’d been hiking and come across a strange arch covered in interweaving vines and blood red roses so dark they were almost black. She had felt inexplicably drawn to the arch that seemed to crackle with magic. But she knew that was ridiculous there was no such thing. And yet she found herself walking towards it as if pulled by some invisible force until she stepped through it…and was met with darkness.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Y/N was pulled back to the present by an intense feeling of panic. None of this made any sense. Nonetheless her survival instincts had kicked in and she knew she couldn’t just linger out in the open she had to find help. So she started forward opting to avoid the eery treeline of the woods hoping that she’d eventually come across some semblance of civilisation even better someone who could help her make sense of what had happened to her.   Y/N felt like she’d been walking for hours perhaps she had her bones wearied with exertion. A shining ray of hope came in the form of a beautiful man sat atop a precarious pile of stones. He struck a princely figure dressed in clothes that looked straight out of a medieval fair a fake sword hanging from a belt at his hips. His soft brown hair lanky limbs and dimples gave him a boyish charm. But his broad shoulders were suggestive of a strong build and the small scar on his nose gave her the impression he’d once broken it perhaps in a fight. Eyes suddenly snapping to hers his features rearranged themselves into a cocky smirk and she suddenly felt quite strongly that the man in front of her was quietly dangerous.   Unfolding himself from his slouched position almost that of a beleaguered sentry he jauntily approached her. Although he did stay at a respectful distance of a few paces. “Good day my lady I have not seen you around these parts before. And I admit I do not recognise the colours of your house. From where do you hail?” Y/N found herself scoffing at his roguish tone and bizarre speech pattern. “From where do I hail? Are you heading to an expo or something. What’s with the cosplay and fake sword?” The man’s handsome features pulled into a slight frown of confusion. It lasted a mere moment before his eyes were oncemore alight with a mischievous glimmer that Y/N found equal parts frightening and exciting.  “Do you jest my lady? I bear the sigil and colours of House Blackwood as is my prerogrative as Lord of Raventree Hall.” He bowed his head to her a hand to his heart. Y/n had to admire his commitment to his costume but it was starting to grate on her nerves that he seemed to talk in riddles when she was desperate for answers. “Right sure you are. Could you please point me in the direction of the nearest town?” Y/n asked awkwardly hoping to try her luck with someone not dressed like a knight. “You do not know where you are my lady?”   “Not exactly. Not at all if I’m being honest. I sort of just walked through an arch and woke up in a field and here I am. Where exactly is here?” The man’s eyebrows shot up in surprise and Y/N detected a trace of concern as his eyes appeared to soften. “You tell a strange tale my lady and I should be pleased to assist you in any way I can. We are in the heart of the Riverlands in Blackwood land.” Y/N felt a fresh surge of panic rise up within her chest as she struggled to understand any of the unfamiliar words the man in front of her had just laced together. Had she somehow time travelled and that was the cause of their mutual confusion? Trying to maintain a semblance of calm she took a deepth breath through her nose. “Can you tell me what the year is?”   The man’s lips turned up in an amused smile. “This close to the borders of Bracken land it depends who you ask. In the eyes of House Blackwood it is the first year of the reign of the true Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen the 129th year after Aegon the conqueror’s conquest.” Y/N let out a high pitched squeek the panic that had settled uncomfortably in her stomach finally bubbling up to breaking point as she began to realise she may be farther from home than she’d first realised. The young man seemed positively alarmed at her outburst his eyes widening as she started taking small steps away from him all the while trying to regulate her frantic breathing. His brow furrowing he started to close the small distance between them a placating hand outstretched as if he expected her to run from him.   “My lady I can see that you are distressed. If I have done or said something to alarm you I assure you it was not my intention.” Y/N told herself to snap out of it. This was likely all some big misunderstanding. That or the stricken looking man in front of her was toying with her. The idea that he would do such a thing when she was so clearly lost confused and vulnerable incensed her. Glaring at him she wordlessly turned on her heels to walk away from him at break neck speed. Hearing footsteps she glanced behind her to see him following at a distance. “Are you following me?” “Yes” He said simply as if it was perfectly obvious that he should. “Brazen bastard” she mumbled unfortunately not low enough for him to miss. A look of surprise as he registered her insult quickly shifted to one of bemusement before Y/N could even begin to worry about him reacting badly. “That may be but I’d rather not see you walk into a den of savages. And that is the direction you’re going in.”   Y/n was quite frankly sick of his cryptic messages at this point. Stopping in her tracks to face him the young man immediately halted mirroring her movements. She fixed him with a stern glare. “I don’t know what you’re playing at but it isn’t funny. I have no idea what you’re talking about. And I’m not a lady so you can drop the act.”   Turning so quickly she was sure her hair must have whipped him in the face she continued on the path she’d chosen. If he wanted to drop mysterious messages of foreboding without telling her anything concrete she’d just as well ignore him. That turned out to be difficult as he resumed following her wordlessly. Y/N broke the silence a while later. “Why are you still following me? I thought you said I was going the wrong way. Headed towards savages as you put it?” Seemingly delighted that she’d finally looked at him and was willingly speaking to him he shot her a dazzling smile that almost softened her resolve to be irritated with him. “To protect you of course. I am a knight and you are a lady in distress. The course you set is a dangerous one but if you choose to walk it then I shall walk it with you.” His smile did not match the promise of life-threatening danger he was suggesting.  “I can take care of myself and since I can’t understand half of what you’re saying I’m not sure I really believe you.” His smile growing wider the young man took a couple of steps towards Y/N to close the distance between between them before gently taking her hand and planting a kiss to her knuckles. “I don’t doubt it fair lady you seem seem have a will of steel but I’d rather not risk your safety if its all the same to you.” Momentarily at a loss for words at his actions Y/N quickly quashed the traitorous fluttering of her heart and cleared her throat as she pulled her hands from his and attempted to put him down gently. “That’s quite enough of that. Look I appreciate your concern… ” she stopped realising she didn’t know his name and looked up at him questioning. “Benjicot Blackwood. Might I Iearn the name of the fair lady in return?” Ignoring his question Y/N went on “but there’s really no need to worry. I’ll be just fine on my own.”  Once again Y/N turned from him and continued to walk towards whatever mythical danger the man had portended. When she didn’t hear his footfalls following her immediately a smile of self-satisfaction ghosted onto her face before she realised she was almost dissapointed. That was until she heard them at a farther distance this time. Glancing behind her but this time not stopping she shouted back to him. “Are you still following me” He had to shout too for her to hear him though there was mirth in his tone “yes my lady you still seem dead set on barrelling head first into danger. And you have not yet given me your name” he responded playfully. Y/N groaned audibly “Why can’t you go bother some other poor girl and leave me alone?” Y/N fumed to hear him laugh. “Because then fair one I might actually have to bother as you say ladies who like my company. And where would be the fun in that when I have you to shout at me?”   Y/n gaped at him in disbelief this man could not be serious. Shaking her head at him she decided to just go back to ignoring him. Perhaps he’d get bored of following her or if she was really lucky fall into a ditch. They walked a little while longer before an arm suddenly shot out around her waist the young man having hastened his steps to step in front of her. “A step further and we’re in Bracken territory. I beseech you to turn back with me. I will take you to my halls and we can discuss your predicament further.” Y/N felt a growing sense of fear at Benjicot’s seriousness.  Perhaps she’d been too quick to write his warnings off. No sooner had she thought this than she heard approaching footsteps and spotted four other men dressed just like him except for the golden colour of their cloaks where his was a deep red. She didn’t like the angry looks on their faces and was ashamed to find herself cowering slightly. Taking in her fright the young man shot around and positioned himself more fully in front of her arm lightly outstretched behind him as if to shield her.   “Get back from the border Blackwood you’re in breech of the assize.”  “Fuck the assize. This is Blackwood land and you know it.” Y/N didn’t have a clue what the two men were arguing about as insults flew back and forth but her ears perked up as the man closest to her red knight levied the next one at her. “Take her with you. Is she fucking stupid or is she so bold to think she can waltz around wherever she likes? Typical Blackwood bitch.” The Lord of Raventree as he’d called himself earlier snarled out a reply stepping forward to shove the golden Knight harshly in the chest. “You craven bastard. You dare insult a lady under my protection?” Y/N should have been panicking at the impending threat of violence but her anger at the man’s insults so blatantly laced with misogyny rose up so fiercely that she heard her own voice among the din before she could stop it. “Don’t you dare call me a bitch. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? I don’t know anything about an assize or why you’re so obsessed with rocks and not crossing them but you can’t just go around calling people names. Have some respect.”   Seemingly stunned into silence perhaps not expecting her to challenge him so brazenly the golden Knight just stared at her in stony silence for a few moments before ignoring her entirely and turning back to her red knight. “Control your woman Blackwood.” Through gritted teeth Benjicot bit back “Speak another word about the lady and there will be violence.” The golden Knight drew his sword pointing directly at her red knight’s chest. Ok so not a fake sword then. Surprising her by laughing tauntingly Benjicot walked right up to the tip of the sword. “You wouldn’t dare.” Y/N told herself she shouldn’t find his passionate defence of her attractive but in the current circumstances she felt she could be forgiven for being irrational. “Come on just leave it” one of the other golden knights piped up. After a tense few moments the golden cloaked man lowered his sword and and stalked away followed by his friends.   Shoulders tense her defender did not turn his back to the knights until they were out of sight before turning around to look at her eyes immediately softening from the aggressive glare he’d just been fronting. “Are you alright my lady? I had hoped to avoid such an interaction.” Y/N flip flopped between finding his evident concern sweet and being irritated that he seemed to think this was her fault for not listening to him. “You think I’m to blame then? You’re the one who kept dropping veiled hints about my impending doom and refusing to clarify what you meant!” Y/N could not for the life of her understand why the infuriating man in front of her was smiling at her. “Why are you smiling at me? Do you enjoy fighting with me?” “You mistake me my lady. I am merely gratified to know that you are well enough to shout at me. I was concerned that you would be shaken and frightened.”    When Y/N didn’t respond mouth opening and closing trying to find a response Benjicot assumed that she must be in some state of shock after all. “Please allow me to take you to Raventree. It would go against my conscience to leave a lady wandering about the riverlands alone when you seem so confused.” With that he held his arm out for her to take an antiquated gesture that seemed to confirm to Y/N she was really not in kansas anymore. Weighing her options she considered that Benjicot Blackwood had teased her and followed her but he had not harmed her and had in fact protected her when he could have walked away. Making her decision she lightly placed her arm on his. “My name is Y/N.” Benjicot grinned at her as if she had given him a star rather than her name placing his other hand atop hers as it rested on his arm and began directing them in the opposite direction “a beautiful name for a beautiful lady.” Blushing fiercely with embarrassment Y/N squeeked out a “Thank you.”  Benjicot must have been chasing Y/N around the Riverlands for quite some time as it took them at least an hour to reach the impressive fortress he called Raventree Hall.      Once she’d gotten over the initial shock of realising she had in fact jumped from her world into another Y/N actually found herself settling in to life in Westeros. It had taken some convincing for Benjicot to believe her story and stop assuming she was mildly insane but he had all the while insisted she stay with him in Raventree Hall gifting her with her own room and beautiful gowns in the colours of House Blackwood. She’d only had her hiking gear on when she was unceremoniously plucked from her world into his and she sought to avoid similar looks of curiosity to the one he’d shot her when they first met. Y/N grew to love Raventree and the people who lived there.   Benjicot had practically forced his friendship open her and as incorrigible and cocky as he could be encouraging a healthy back and forth banter between them at all times she could not be anything but grateful for it. Each day he would show her something new always hoping to amuse her whether it be a new room to explore in his ancestral halls a book he thought she might like or the rose garden tucked away in the grounds which had become her favourite haunt.    The roses reminded Y/N of Beauty and the Beast her favourite fairytale from back home which Benjicot had made her tell at least a hundred times listening just as attentively a hand cupping his chin and eyes never leaving hers each time. She supposed that her own situation did somewhat resemble her favourite tale down to her very own castle and beast. Benjicot had always been a gentleman with her but she had heard the stories of Bloody Ben whispered by his servants and seen first hand his willingness to resort to violence to protect her when they first met.   More often than not it was Benjicot or Benji as he seemed to insist only she call him who came to her always seeking out her opinions. But today it was Y/N seeking him out. She’d been growing more and more homesick of late and wanted to be with the one person she felt could truly understand eventually finding him in the armoury wielding his sword in different formations. Hoping to sneak up on him and having taken fencing lessons herself back in her own world she quietly tiptoed over to the swords. Grabbing the lightest one she could she walked soundlessly back over to him before he suddenly turned and clashed his sword against hers. “Sorry Y/N but you should know that I’d recognise your footfalls anywhere and you’re not as quiet as you think.”  “Rude” she huffed back sliding her sword down his and shoving him away from her. He grinned at the challenge. “You didn’t mention you’d handled a sword before.” “Only a little.”   He parried a fresh blow from her easily blocking the next.   “I can see that” He teased earning a snarl from her though it did not have any true aggression behind it. He continued to block her blows but seemed reluctant to attack and she used this reticence against him to lunge and place her sword close enough to his neck to refute any delusions he had about her lack of skill. But he was prepared for this and swung his sword upwards to block her again before taking hold of her waist and spinning her around her back hitting his chest. His sword hand wove around around her shoulders as he kept the blade at a distance from her body while Benji gently trailed his other hand down the side of her bodice his touch feather light and searing all at once. He leant down to whisper in her ear “You left yourself open here when you lunged.”   Y/N had always found Benjicot attractive even when he teased and irritated her but she’d tried to quash any romantic feelings for him so as not to ruin their friendship. But his closeness to her now her body pressed against his was intoxicating and she struggled to think coherently. Suddenly releasing her Benjicot smiled widely and bowed. “I shall see you later my lady I am off to attend to my duties.” Throwing his sword carelessly over his shoulder he turned and exited the armoury leaving Y/N to stew over the unwelcome feelings their impromptu sword fight had brought to the fore.   Later that night Y/n could not help the wave of sadness that threatened to crush her under the weight of it from sending her into a spiral of homesickness. Soft sniffles and sobs echoed about the room as she tried to square the new life she now loved with her feelings of guilt over leaving her family behind. The rattling of her bedroom door knob sent her flying from her bed in alarm as she quickly grabbed a small blade form the wooden desk and hurried to conceal herself behind the door. As the intruder entered she wildly swung around to jab the point of her dagger into their ribcage. The intruder stiffened and she looked up to se that it was just Benji whose brow was quirked up in amusement. How could he act so nonchalant about her nearly spearing him like a fish?   “What’s so funny? I nearly gutted you!”  “With a letter opener?” She looked down to find that what she’d thought was a dagger was indeed just a letter opener not likely to do much damage. She forced out a laugh that ended up sounding much more like a sob and Benji’s face immediately fell once he took in her tearstained appearance fully. Y/N couldn’t bear his look of concern certain it would just make her cry harder and so she broke the silence. “What brings you to my room at this time of night anyway to give me the opportunity to spear you in the first place?” She’d hoped to diffuse the tension and make him laugh but his expression remained just as serious eyes filled with worry. “I heard you crying.”  “Oh.” He had come to check that she was OK. His gentle concern for her sent forth a fresh wave of tears and when Benji opened his arms to her she immediately fell into them her forehead hitting his chest as his hand came up to stroke her hair in a comforting gesture. “What ails you my lady. Whatever you need I will see it done.”   His kindness only made her crying worse and he kissed her sweetly on the crown of her head rubbing soothing circles along her spine. “I miss my family and my home.” Benji stiffened as if he were expecting a blow but he let her continue. “And mostly I feel guilty that I’m not sure I even want to go home. Truthfully I love Raventree and your friendship has meant everything to me.”   Benji took hold of Y/N’s elbows and lightly pushed her away from his chest so he could look into her eyes. “It gladdens my heart to hear that you feel this way about my home. I should like you to consider it your home too. You will always have a place here with me.” Kissing her forehead tenderly he held Y/N’s head against his heart again as if she were made of glass or something truly precious to him he was scared to break. Little did she know how true this was.   Weeks later Y/N found that her homesickness had begun to dissipate to a dull ache. But her feelings for Benji had grown and spread like the vines of the rose bushes she loved so much wild and uncontainable. It was difficult to even be in his presence without wanting him to touch her and hold her as he had the night he’d found her crying.   Sitting with her in what he’d come to refer to as her rose garden he kept shooting furtive glances at her as she read from a tome on his house history. “Why are you staring at me?” “I’m not?” “Try that again without the question mark”   Benjicot surprised her shifting in his spot next to her to turn to her fully their knees touching before taking both of her hands in his. “I have not been able to look away from you for more than a few moments ever since I first laid eyes on you. I must admit that I am desperately in love with you and wondered if by some chance of fate you might feel the same way?”   Y/N’s jaw fell open in shock. “ You love me?”  He squeezed her hands “most ardently.”  Her mind spinning she threw caution to the wind and flung her arms around Benji’s shoulders to kiss him. He reacted instantly pulling her as close towards him as possible until she was in his lap his hands grasping at her hips to pull her closer still as if he couldn’t believe she was real.   Breaking the kiss for oxygen Benji began to trail a line of kisses down Y/N’s neck leaving her breathless one hand pressing her back closer to him. “I wish you to be my wife to become the Lady of Raventree Hall and House Blackwood.”  Butterflies erupted in her stomach.   “Future Lady Blackwood am I?”  “Should you permit it I will protect you cherish you and love you for the remainder of my days or for as long as you will allow. I humbly offer myself to you as your husband with all the love I possess for you.”  “And what if I disagree with you and challenge you. What if we argue constantly?”  “We do not argue my love you scold me and I listen” He shot back with a playful grin.   “And if I decide to change all the tapestries pink?”  Benji sighed tilting his head to her eye level so she could read the sincerity in his eyes.   “I want all of you including your thoughts and opinions. They’re what made me fall in love with you. I want you to share them with me even if they challenge mine especially then even when I hold you in my arms. As to the tapestries I’m rather partial to my house colours but I would try to bear the change if it would please you.”   Y/N giggled at that before planting a tender kiss to his lips. “Then I consent to be be your wife and Lady. You can’t take it back though. You’re stuck with me now.”   Benji pressed their foreheads together cupping the sides of her face to brush her lips with his. “And how grateful I am for it.” He spoke against them before pressing his lips to hers in a kiss he hoped expressed his undying devotion to his lady.     A face I’d go to war for. The title is based on the line ‘love is like the wild rose-briar’ from an Emily Bronte poem I love called Love and Friendship.,2024-07-14 09:20:09 GMT

227,House of the Dragon,['aegon ii targaryen'  'alicent hightower'  'aemond targaryen'  'hotd critical'  'hotd'  'anti hotd'  'stop trying to make aegon look like a clueless idiot'  "he isn't"],chemicalreal,Rewatching episode 1x07 in light of recent events makes Alicent and Aemond’s interactions with Aegon even more frustrating to watch. The writers seem intent on portraying him as clueless and dumb despite in season 1 there is evidence to the contrary.  You have Aemond being harshly questioned by Viserys who at some point menacingly asks him who told him about Rhaenyra’s children being bastards.  Aemond knows that he can’t just throw Alicent under the bus because at least he and his brother are still the king’s kin so he knows nothing will happen to them (which isn’t a guarantee for Alicent despite being the king’s wife) regardless so he blames Aegon.  Now Aegon who is FAR from stupid immediately picks up what his brother might be actually doing without knowing the context (and let’s remember the two don’t have a good relationship at this point and he could simply deny thinking Aemond is trying to put him in trouble to settle a score) and immediately plays along even deflecting the argument to how there is no need to have a planted rumour because it’s plain to see.  Throughout season 1 Aegon repeatedly demonstrates a greater awareness than other characters give him credit for. In the carriage scene he keeps acting skeptical to the news Viserys wanted him as heir but Alicent as usual shuts him down even calling him stupid for doubting her love for him. Well considering how things are going in season 2 he wasn’t really wrong about that either was he?   Season 1 Aegon would have immediately pointed out Alicent’s hypocrisy for trying to diminish him in comparison to his father simply because contrarily to expectations he is not willing to be a mindless puppet like Viserys was. Aegon has already picked up on Otto and Alicent’s real expectations of him. Why would he ask Alicent if she loves him? Because he genuinely doubt that especially now that he is being dragged to wear a crown out of nowhere. Friendly reminder that not being trained and literate doesn’t automatically equate to being stupid.  Additionally portraying episode 2 as Otto’s grand triumph is just completely wrong. Otto who has been manipulating everyone like pieces on a chessboard finally gets booted off by the person he least expected it from. This comes after he shows no respect for his son’s death shamelessly declaring that he will parade his body for the sake of their image as the silent sisters were still sewing his head to his body. But of course god forbid we don’t immediately dumb down everything Aegon does or the audience might start thinking he could actually be a fair competitor for the designated hero of the show.,2024-07-14 08:51:13 GMT

6,House of the Dragon,['hotd'],xiiiine,Aegon has no claim to the throne The Widow’s Law was implemented in the reign of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen on the advice of his wife Queen Alysanne Targaryen. It later became known as part of Queen Alysanne’s laws.1  When Alysanne Targaryen hosted her women’s courts she became aware of the plight of widows throughout the realm. In times of peace it was not uncommon for a man to outlive the wife of his youth as women die in the birthing bed and in times of war the men may perish in the fight leaving behind widows. Due to this men would often take a new wife whose presence was resented by the children of the first wife who would often feel no bonds of affection for her. Upon the man’s death his heir could and would often expel the newly widowed wife reducing her to penury; in the case of lords the heirs might strip away the widow’s prerogatives incomes and servants reducing her to no more than an impoverished boarder.1  To rectify these ills in 52 AC King Jaehaerys implemented the Widow’s Law reaffirming the right of the eldest son (or daughter where there was no son) to inherit but requiring said heirs to maintain surviving widows in the same conditions they enjoyed before their husband’s death. A lord’s widow be she a second third or fourth wife could no longer be driven from his castle nor deprived of her servants clothing and income. The same law also forbade a man to disinherit the children by a first wife in order to bestow their lands seat or property on a later wife or her children.1,2024-07-14 11:48:10 GMT

IN MOURNING it is said that Aemma turned instead to her uncle who sat upon the Iron Throne— her mother’s birthright of which was stolen from her … She begged for the war to end … He nearly granted her wish had it not meant his surrender.  These claims by SEPTON EUSTACE were said to be rumour— blasphemous in nature even for the Princess loved her mother dearly and would not have betrayed her for the memory of an uncle who had once been fond of her in their youth.  And though SEPTA MOREA affirms that a young she-dragon much like the Princess’s VISERAX was seen hovering over KING&#x27;s LANDING the whereabouts of KING AEGON II TARGARYEN were unknown that night … by the fortnight it was decided that THE PRINCESS WAS LOST TO THE WIND.        LADY VENETIA HIGHTOWER was later threatened with execution during the taking of King’s Landing by Queen Rhaenyra’s faction: the BLACKS … DOWAGER QUEEN ALICENT HIGHTOWER the QUEEN IN CHAINS pleaded for her lady companion’s life above all else.  Her husband and the Dowager Queen’s eldest brother SER GWAYNE HIGHTOWER was slain when he attempted to sound the alarm for the Greens; Lady Venetia’s born family HOUSE REDWYNE had also sworn fealty to the Usurper. SHE WAS AMONGST THE GREENS’ MOST INTIMATE SUPPORTERS.  BUT FOR ALL THE PLEAS OF PEACE THAT HAD BEEN DISMISSED OVER THE COURSE OF THE WAR Lady Venetia was pardoned of her execution … &quot;for the sake of the Three Queens who had loved you and may still do“ as Queen Rhaenyra said.  These three Queens were said to be the late Queen Aemma Dowager Queen Alicent and Rhaenyra herself ⸻ when the smallfolk intercepted the carriage meant to bring Lady Venetia to exile SHE CRIED OUT THEIR NAMES AND BEGGED FOR FORGIVENESS.        Amongst the greatest losses in the Dance of the Dragons was that of HOUSE MIRYANG; a noble house of Old Valyrian descent that carried with them the last knowledge of the art of sorcery from their homeland.  MIRYANG ADALLA had ridden on the back of CARAXES with DAEMON TARGARYEN  … and burned alive in the flames of the old she-dragon VHAGAR. She was still breathing when the dragons danced in their descent as Daemon blinded the ONE-EYED PRINCE.  THE MATRIARCH of House Miryang died a loyal lieutenant … it was said that it was she who dragged the BLOOD WYRM to the walls of Harrenhal with her sorcery where her charred remains were found beside the dragon’s corpse.        Her sister’s remains delivered to the Half-Moon fortress Adalla’s heart charred from the collision of Vhagar’s flames and her own sorcery; MIRYANG ARYEONG was only seven-and-ten when she became THE LAST MATRIARCH of House Miryang.  When given the rational choice of forsaking her house’s oath to QUEEN RHAENYRA to protect the millennia of ancient and knowledge on sorcery protected behind the walls of HALF-MOON Aryeong only saw a future in which sorcery would be wielded by the false Targaryen kings born from ALICENT HIGHTOWER.  And so she did cry out to the heavens …  DRACARYS! … and though House Miryang were no such dragonlords of Old Valyria the great wild dragon CANNIBAL descended upon the islet and set it aflame bringing down the great HOUSE MIRYANG and the arts of sorcery they had guarded so close for centuries.        LADY GISELLE BARATHEON cared little for the death of Aemond Targaryen whom she was promised to but she had mourned for Little Jaehaerys and Maelor the young babe whom she had raised alongside his Queen-Mother QUEEN HELAENA TARGARYEN.   QUEEN RHAENYRA  allowed for Aemond’s betrothed to keep Helaena’s company while in captivity for her half-sister was of no real threat to Rhaenyra and in the moons following her eldest boy’s death Helaena had fallen to madness and despair … soothed only by LADY GISELLE.  TRAGEDY struck when Helaena threw herself from her window in MAEGOR&#x27;S HOLDFAST to die impaled upon the iron spikes that lined the dry moat below. It is said that Giselle had tried to catch her at the windowsill only to be dragged down in THE FALL.  Their bodies were found in a NEAR-EMBRACE. Helaena was one-and-twenty; GISELLE WAS NINE-AND-TEN.        LADY ELINOR CELTIGAR the most beloved lady-in-waiting of QUEEN RHAENYRA’s entourage was the granddaughter of the Queen’s MASTER OF COIN on the BLACK COUNCIL; though there was nothing monetary to be gained for the Queen’s affections for the young maiden.  She treasured Elinor till the end of her days and Elinor in turn was loyal to her Queen until their return to DRAGONSTONE … when  SER ALFRED BROOME  gave the Celtigar daughter a chance to turn her back on the Queen ELINOR CURSED THE HAND WHICH HELD HIS SWORD SO THAT ONE DAY HE MAY CASTRATE HIMSELF.  When Rhaenyra was torn from her son’s arms Elinor clung onto her skirt so fiercely that she cut herself on her armour … ”Go! Leave my sweet girl!“ Rhaenyra had pleaded but Elinor only embraced her as Sunfyre blasted them with fire and ate them in less than seven bites … for her loyalty to the Queen Aegon II named Elinor THE BITCH QUEEN&#x27;S WHORE.        PRINCESS ALEREA TARGARYEN WAS THE LAST OF ALICENT’S CHILDREN TO DIE. Queen Rhaenyra had granted her mercy for her lack of involvement in the war and so she was confined to the DOWAGER QUEEN’s apartments in the company of her mother. The same mercy was extended by Rhaenyra’s son AEGON III TARGARYEN.  It was said that Alerea loved her mother dearly and would give her comfort in those days of captivity. Alicent in turn loved her daughter just as much … Alerea was her spitting image without her flaws and her favourite daughter but THE GRIEF OF THE DEATH OF ALEREA’S SIBLINGS HAD FOREVER CHANGED HER.  The exact details are unknown but it was said that a sensitive matter was brought up to Alerea by Alicent one day … Alerea was heard screaming the word ”BASTARD!“ several times following this unknown revelation … while Alicent could be heard pleading her daughter to listen HER DAUGHTER’S RAGE WAS NOT QUELLED.  The worst of whispers amongst servants claimed that Alerea was the bastard spoken of the living embodiment of her mother’s hypocrisy of her treatment of the late Queen Rhaenyra&#x27;s FIRST THREE SONS. It was easily believed … out of KING VISERYS I’s five children with the Dowager Queen Alerea was the only one to be born with her mother’s red-brown curls.  ALEREA BROUGHT A BLADE UPON HERSELF BY NEXT DUSK; the thought of Alicent who was found weeping over her daughter’s corpse committing murder on her only living child could not even be possible. The Dowager Queen passed away a fortnight later AT THE HOUR OF THE WOLF.,2024-07-14 11:40:09 GMT

He most definitely was 😭 he intended to do serious harm to him.   When Aemond and Vhagar were in the woods and Aegon flew above them Aemond told Vhagar “not yet”. He KNEW sunfyre had never been into battle and Meleys was a full on war dragon. He KNEW Aegon stood no chance against Rhaenys YET he let him face them alone. He wanted Aegon to get hurt by Meleys so that later on it will look like his injuries came from Meleys and not himself when he ordered Vhagar to open fire on him.   Aegon was engulfed by Vhagar’s flames and was left burnt to shit. Rhaenys got sprinkled with a lil ash no sign of a burn anywhere on her. If Aemond was really intending to aim for Rhaenys she wouldn’t have come away from that absolutely unscathed. When Aegon and Sunfyre fell from the sky and landed in the trees the look on Aemond’s face doesn’t scream guilt or remorse.   Think back to the time when he killed Lucerys. That look on his face. The actual guilt he showed. The way he said “no Vhagar no” he did not intend to do it and he showed he did not intend to do it. Where was all of that emotion when he opened fire on his brother and pretty much shot him down from the sky?   And when he found Aegon on the ground with Sunfyre and he sheathed his sword when he heard Criston. There was no guilt or remorse. He took his brothers dagger and strolled away. HE DID NOT CARE!   “Tis I the younger brother who studies history and philosophy it is I who trains with the sword who rides the largest dragon in the world. It is I who should be…”  PRINCE REGENT AEMOND IS COMING,2024-07-14 11:33:26 GMT

1,House of the Dragon,['inspiration'  'hotd'],lionspawfic,Timeline (Guesstimation) The show really messed with ages and some events mainly choosing the 9th year of Viserys’s reign to be 172 years before the birth of Daenrys but keeping the Great Council in 101 and smooshing the ages of Alicent/Rhaenyra’s kids together as well as their own ages. I’ve come up with a speculative timeline of events. Though some are currently complete guesstimations that I’ll update if we ever get more information. I am watching the show again and noting down any specific time mentioned or ages as I go.  Rhaenys and Viserys’s starting ages are largely estimated as well. This timeline isn’t a hard “correct” one but one I’m working on and using for fanfic purposes. I do have a thought process behind all of my guesses though.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Timeline  99 AC  Daemon Targaryen is born to Baelon and Alyssa Targaryen.*  101 AC  The Great Council occurs where fourteen claims were heard. The two serious claims were Viserys I Targaryen (Eldest Son of Baelong Jaehaerys’s 2nd Son) against Rhaenys Targaryen (Only Child of Aemon Jaehaerys’s Eldest Son). Aemma (14) is pregnant at the time. Jaehaerys decrees that Viserys Targaryen (16) would inherit the throne instead of his elder cousin Rhaenys (19).  111 AC  Aemma (24) and Viserys Targaryen (26) welcome their only living child Rhaenyra Targaryen into the world.  126 AC (9th Year of the Reign of Viserys I Targaryen)  Aemma Targaryen is pregnant once more.  Rhaenyra Targaryen (14) is the Realm’s Delight and Viserys and Aemma’s only living child. Her best friend is Alicent Hightower (15). Daemon Targaryen (27) is the Young Prince and current heir who was half raised by his elder brother and goodsister.  Aemma goes into labor and dies along with her son Baelon.  Six months later Rhaenyra has turned (15) in this time and Alicent (15) has been spending time with Viserys (41). Laena (12) was suggested as a match first.  Criston Cole (23) is selected by Rhaenyra as the newest member of the Kingsguard.  Viserys I Targaryen (41) announces he will marry Alicent Hightower (15).  127 AC  Viserys and Alicent marry and soon after she becomes pregnant.  Aegon II Targaryen is born to Alicent Hightower (16) and Viserys Targaryen (42).  129 AC  The War in the Stepstones (I) has been going on almost three years. Laenor (15) is also participating.  Aegon II Targaryen’s second name day celebration occurs in the Kingswoods. Queen Alicent (18) is already heavily pregnant with Helaena. Rhaenyra Targaryen is still only 17 but preparing to turn 18.  130 AC  After months of planning and the birth of Helaena Targaryen Rhaenyra (19) heads out on her search for a husband with Criston Cole (27) her sworn protector. Rhaenyra abandons it a couple months in after being unsatisfied and with two months left to go. It has been a year since the name day and planning everything during this period.  Rhaenyra returns home via boat as Daemon arrives back from the Stepstones.  Alicent has two children at this point Aegon (3) and Helaena (a little less – 1).  In one day in the Capital there is a party welcoming Daemon back Daemyra sneaking out and Rhaenyra getting ruined followed by a morning after that includes banishing Daemon (30) back to Rhea firing Otto after Alicent (19) has a stern talk with her stepdaughter (19) and Viserys telling Rhaenyra she’s going to marry Laenor (16). Within a week Alicent has found out about Rhaenyra lying from Larys and Viserys convinced the Velaryons to agree to the marriage.  The royal wedding is planned.  (I will say there is a few month time skip say two because that’s the minimum for planning a royal wedding and the lords and ladies managing to arrive across Westeros.)  131 AC  Daemon has snuck back to the Vale and murdered his super-hot wife who deserved better and back to King’s Landing in time for the wedding.  The first day of the festivities dawn with Alicent (20) wearing a dramatic green dress Laenor’s (17) boyfriend Joffrey Lonmouth being murdered by Criston Cole (27/28) and Rhaenyra (19) and Laenor (17) getting married.  Laena (17) flirts with Daemon (30/31) during the wedding.  Both Rhaenyra and Alicent are pregnant soon and give birth before the end of the year (based off Jace’s actual birth in the books and speculating about Aemond).  Rhaenyra (20) and Laenor (17) have “their” first child Jacaerys Velaryon who looks like Harwin Strong Rhaenyra’s friend and Commander of the City Guard.  Alicent (20) and Viserys (46) have their third child Aemond Targaryen.  Laena and Daemon have begun courting and/or married in the meantime and leave Westeros at a time unclear.  132 AC  Baela and Rhaena are born to Laena Velaryon (18) and Daemon Targaryen (32).  133 AC  Alicent** and Rhaenyra are pregnant together once more.  Alicent Hightower (22) gives birth to her final child Daeron.  Rhaenyra Targaryen (22) gives birth to Lucerys Velaryon.  141 AC  Daeron Targaryen (8) is sent to Oldtown to be a ward.***  Rhaenyra (30) gives birth to Joffrey Velaryon.  Aegon (14) Jacaerys (10) and Lucerys (8) prank Aemond (10) with “the Pink Dread”.  Laena Velaryon (27) commits suicide by Vhagar’s fire when the birth of her third child is revealed to be deadly.  Aemond (10) loses an eye when he fight Jacaerys (10) Baela and Rhaena (9) and Lucerys (8).  Daemon and Rhaenyra marry within a week of Laena and Laenor’s deaths.  143 AC  Aegon (16) and Helaena (13) are forced to marry.  147 AC  Lucerys (14) has his right to inherit Driftmark challenged.  Aegon II Targaryen (20) and Rhaenyra I Targaryen (36) both succeed their father upon his death. The Dance of the Dragons starts.  Late Fall/Winter is starting.  Current Ages: Rhaenyra/Alicent (36) Daemon (48) Rhaenys (65) Viserys (62) Aegon the Elder (20) Helaena (17) Jacaerys/Aemond (16) Baela/Rhaena (15) Lucery/Daeron (14) Joffrey (6) Aegon the Younger (?)**** Viserys the Younger (?)****  *Speculation based off Daemon’s apparent youth in the show. Ages are unclear so I am just trying to make sense of them. I am basing Daemon’s birth mostly off how old he is supposed to be when he dies which is 49.  **Speculation as Daeron’s age is still unclear in the show.  ***Speculation as I am trying to account for some large change that could make Alicent hostile again when according to Laenor things had settled down. Daeron being sent away potentially against her wishes may account for this especially if she believes Rhaenyra had some factor in the decision.  ****Still working on getting Aegon the Younger and Viserys the Younger figured out as I am part of the way through my rewatch.,2024-07-14 10:42:05 GMT
111,House of the Dragon,['hotd'  'writer ezran'],sylasthegrim,This morning I was informed that @4kisses also known as @prongsio had lifted an Aegon oneshot from me. Their since then deleted fic “Silent Love” heavily lifted from mine “Silence is the Beginning of Hell”.  Upon reading it and having it read by a handful of other writers I confirmed that the plot was identical and the scenes were the same just rewritten but in the same order. Some of the dialogues were straight-up copy/paste with simply some pronouns or contractions switched.   Here are some side by side comparisons. In orange is their fic in blue is mine.      There is more but I want to keep the post short.   I reached our to the person but they refused to admit they took from me and promptly blocked me when I presented them with screenshots.   Watch out fellow writers. PLEASE DO NOT SEND HATE TO THAT PERSON. This is simply meant to inform and warn.   DMs with them below the cut.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Then I started to send them the screenshots with the highlighted part but they blocked me without a word.   I wouldn’t have said anything publicly if they had only admitted to it… but since they can’t take accountability I am warning others with proof. I don’t want them to do the same to others.   The fic is probably still available since a dozen people had reblogged it.,2024-07-14 10:30:44 GMT

58,House of the Dragon,['english is not my first language'  'davos blackwood'  'aeron bracken'  'davos x aeron'  'hotd season 2'  'davos blackwood x aeron bracken'  'enemies to lovers'],witchybitchycrybaby,I hate myself for loving you Davos Blackwood x Aeron Bracken         SFW enemies to lovers some usual bickering between these two fluff at the end(?)  I’m so obsessed with them and I haven even watched hotd yet  ✨✨✨  It was a warm evening in Westeros right on the border of the Blackwood and Bracken lands. The air was filled with the scent of the forest and earth and the crickets were chirping their everyday song. Somewhere in the distance a river’s quiet murmuring could be heard.   And in the midst of it all was Davos Blackwood. He was leaning against a tree eyeing a meadow that had became a place in which Blackwoods and Brackens most often met to argue. About boundary stones about the cows not eating their grass and about many other things. It also became a place in which Davos could most often see Aeron Bracken.   Ah yes Aeron Bracken - the boy who was his enemy who was everything his family despised and whom Davos hated. But he also somehow didn’t.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Because there was also this other side of him that was drawn to the other boy in ways he couldn’t fathom. Every time he saw the golden haired boy he felt this pull towards him the one that filled him with both hatred and desire. And so Davos Blackwood hated Aeron Bracken. He hated that his heart raced every time he saw him hated the way Aeron’s smile froze all his senses. He wanted to push the boy away because maybe just maybe these feelings might disappear turn into nothing but a dream.   But he couldn’t. He was drawn to him like a moth to a flame. How could he feel so strongly for someone who represented everything he was supposed to hate?  He hated Aeron Bracken for making him feel this way confused and divided between his family and his heart. But most of all he hated himself for… loving Aeron for needing him.  Davos tightened his jaw when he saw a familiar figure in the distance. Now came the moment to play his part. Because if he couldn’t have his feelings reciprocated he would make the Bracken boy hate him too. Hatred was still better than indifference after all.   “Lost your way Bracken?” Davos asked coming closer to the other boy. “Or am I so irresistible you just missed me?”  Aeron lifted his chin up a bit. “Dream on Blackwood. If I had any say in it I’d be anywhere but here breathing the same air as a Blackwood.”  “Funny thing” Davos retorted with a smirk on his face. “because your presence here feels like a punishment for some past life sin. What did I do to deserve this?”  Yes Davos thought what did I do to be so close and yet so far? To be right here with Aeron within the arm’s reach and still feel like there was a canyon between them?  “Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk Blackwood?” He asked through gritted teeth anger flashing in his beautiful eyes.   “Not at all.” Davos laughed but it held no trace of joy or fun. “I’m quite an entertaining person you see.”  “Did the whores in brothels tell you that? Because you’re very far from being entertaining trust me. You’re just a pain in my ass nothing more nothing less.”  Davos looked at Aeron for a while. Oh this little shit and his bloody sharp tongue will get him killed some day. The black haired boy quietly promised himself to show this Bracken what a real pain in the ass feels like.  “It’s almost impressive how you manage to be so consistently infuriating. You must practice in front of a mirror.” Said Davos clenching and unclenching his fists. Gods only knew how much he wanted to just push the blond boy against a tree and have his way with him.  Aeron was already opening his mouth to say something when suddenly they heard a rumble of thunder somewhere nearby and a lightning flashed across the sky. The heavens opened up and in seconds the boys were soaked wet clothes sticking to their bodies.   Davos swore under his breath and before he could even think about what he was doing he reached out and gripped Aeron’s hand tightly. The contact making his own body jolt with how right it felt.  “Come on” he said trying to be louder than the rain. “There’s an old shed not far from here. We can hide there.”  Aeron stood completely still for a moment looking at their clasped hands. He could feel the shiver run up his back but he decided that it must have been the rain. It must have… right?  He then tried to pull out of the Blackwood’s hold but the other boy only tightened his grip even more if it was even possible. “Don’t touch me! I’m not going anywhere with you Blackwood!”  “Oh come on we don’t have time for this. We have to get going. You can yell at me all you want later when there’s a roof over our heads.”  Aeron gave it a thought; it was stupid being alone with this specific Blackwood in some shed in the middle of the forest. But then again he was too far from home and it was an even stupider idea to go back in this weather.  He glanced at Davos’ dark eyes and nodded.   Davos didn’t let go of Aeron’s warm and soft hand as he led them through the bushes and muddy ground. Another lightning lit up the sky right before them and they quickened their pace as the thunder rumbled.   Where in the seven hells is this damned shed? he thought it should be right here. Blackwood stopped abruptly causing the blond boy to bump into him.   “Gods you don’t even know where that shed is do you? I knew I shouldn’t trust you Blackwood. You’re so fucking lost right now aren’t you?”  “Shut up Bracken!” Davos yelled turning his head and trying to find his way through the rain and trees. “I’m not lost.”  Finally he decided to turn left. It couldn’t get any worse than it already was anyway. Wet as they were they could wander through the forest some more.  As they ran slipping on the mud the wooden shed loomed into view and Davos wanted to laugh with joy. It was and old structure abandoned for years and dilapidated but still it provided shelter.   Davos pulled Aeron inside and closed the creaking door behind them. The air inside was musty the scent of punk wood mixed with the smell of rain-soaked soil.   Aeron pulled his hand from the other boy’s strong grip his breath coming in short bursts as he looked at him. “Great. Just great. Stuck here with you.”  The boy muttered something more under his nose but began shaking water from his golden locks; Davos had a feeling that he was just cursing him.  “You’re welcome to leave Bracken. The door’s right there if you want to try your luck.” Davos retorted taking off his wet tunic. He could feel Aeron’s intense gaze flickering to his bare chest when he thought he wasn’t looking.   Aeron then began removing his own tunic avoiding Davos’ eyes like the plague. And Davos on the contrary looked at him without a trace of shame. His heart pounded as hid eyes traced the lines of Aeron’s lean and yet muscular body.   “What are you looking at Blackwood?” He snapped though his voice wavered.  Davos stepped closer his pulse quickening. He didn’t want to play this game anymore. “You” he said his voice low and a bit strangled. “You stand here looking so wet and pretty like that and I…”  I can’t help it.  Before Aeron could do or say anything to respond Davos closed the distance between them and crushed his lips onto Aeron’s soft ones with hunger and desperation. It lasted only a second before the blond boy pushed him away with eyes wide with shock.   Oh but how sweet this second was. Davos licked his lips wanting to taste him for another second longer.   “What the Seven hells is wrong with you?” Aeron snapped his chest heaving.   And yet his eyes contradicted his words. Davos could see it clearly: the flick of desire and want. He smirked knowing that he had just won.  “What is wrong with me?” He repeated his voice hoarse and husky. “What’s wrong with you Bracken? You liked it.”  “No I didn’t.” Aeron protested quickly but his faltering voice gave him away.  Davos leaned over the other boy’s face their noses almost touching. He could feel Aeron’s warm breath on his lips.   “You want me to do it again. Admit it. You want this as much as I do.”  Aeron’s breath hitched in his throat. Davos could see the storm of emotions in his eyes similar to the one awaiting them outside. He could see how strife-ridden he was; all the hate ander and underneath them the hunger.   Davos raised his hand and touched the boy’s cheek caressing the soft skin. Aeron whined quietly and in a voice barely above a whisper he said “Yes.”  That one word was all the invitation Davos needed. He surged forward capturing Aeron’s lips in another kiss this one slower and more deliberate. Aeron didn’t push him away this time. Instead he gripped his hands on Davos’ shoulders pulling him even closer.   Their tongues danced together while Davos’ hands roamed over Aeron’s body savoring the feel of his warm soft skin beneath his fingertips.   Davos broke the kiss and trailed his lips down the blond boy’s jaw planting soft kisses along the way. Aeron’s head tilted back a quiet moan escaping his lips as Davos’ mouth moved to his neck sucking gently at his sensitive skin.   “This is wrong” aeron whispered but his grip on Davos only tightened.   “I know” Davos replied and rested his forehead against Aeron’s. “But I don’t care.”  “You know” started Aeron again when they sat on the wooden floor leaning his head on the black-haired boy’s shoulder. “for a Blackwood you are not the worst company.”  Davos laughed at the comment and pressed a gentle kiss to his temple. “And for a Bracken you’re not as hopeless as the rest of your kin.”,2024-07-14 12:59:26 GMT

2,House of the Dragon,['malory towers'  'reginald the vampire'  'vikings valhalla'],themaresnest-dumblr,House Of The Dragging On Anyone else out there feeling that they are watching it more out of a sense of duty having even passed the ‘hope beyond expectation’ stage?  As the other half messaged &#x27;I watch three current shows - “House Of The Dragon” “Malory Towers” and “Reginald The Vampire.” “Reginald The Vampire” has better acting and “Malory Towers” more believable less cliched villains than &#x27;House Of The Dragon’.   Now &#x27;Vikings: Valhalla’ is back I’ve even less reason to care about a show whose target audience appears to be those dried semen and pot smelling trainwrecks found 24/7 in your local Geek Retreat.’  (For the benefit of our non-British viewers Geek Retreat is a franchise of cafes which offers the opportunity for people to play boardgames card games RPGs etc. which expanded fast and contracted even faster largely because each franchise discovered it couldn’t compete against the existing &#x27;geek/nerd’ cafes and bars that had been offering the same for years except miles cheaper because they weren’t based on the main streets of cities and towns where the rates are eye-watering. Oh and weren’t having to pay a big &#x27;franchise fee’ either)  Ouch!  Know how they feel. How can a show on such a budget prove to be such a crushing disappointment?  How can a show be made on such a scale where you seriously couldn’t care less about any of the characters post the departure of Milly Alcock (the fact they keep having to get her in cameo flashbacks says it all).  Every single one of them is a dreadful cliche the worst of them being - no prizes for guessing …  Prince Aemond Targaryen the One Eyed Chin who may as well grow a silly moustache to twirl every time he does some utterly predictable piece of villainy.  What? He has designs on the throne for himself? Wow.  He kills his own brother in a battle whilst making it look like an accident? We never say that one coming.  Old Chinnochio’s major character motivation is the chips on his shoulder from a disability and being a creepy pervert meaning he wants power so no one will dare make fun of him again? That really sets him apart from all the other characters …  *** cough! ***  &#x27;House Of The Dragon’ has a budget inversely proportionate to the originality entertainment it has to give.  It is just one series of tired old tropes after another done far better before by more talented actors and producers who had to try harder rather than shrug their shoulders and smirk &#x27;oh well the CGI will get us out of trouble - and if they don’t we can always throw in some tits and bum to spike the ratings’ It’s like Tinseltown’s been taken over by those same butt lazy students who relied on AI bots and essay mills to get their grades.  George R R Martin like J K Rowling has proven someone who is good at cutting pasting and contemporizing better writer’s work but is left floundering around like a beached cod the moment those sources dry up.

You can now read the next part here: i (posted July 17 2024)  Synopsis: Amidst rising tensions and a looming war House of Tully seeks to strengthens its strongest alliances by proposal a marriage between Benjicot Blackwood heir to Raventree and Elmo Tully’s only daughter.   Content Warning(s): mentions of violence no detailed depictions however. Era related content and sexism.   Word count: 1.8k   &lt;!-- more --&gt;      “It is done then?”   Elmo looked across the table at his son his heir as Kermit Tully nodded his head — his head bowing forward in response to his father’s words “It is.” He simply replied head lifting then to make eye contact with his father’s.   The pair stood in silence as the weight of his admission lingered in the air the flames from the torches that lit the room casting a dim glow over the face of the father and his son who could have been mistaken for a mirrored image of himself if not for his own having grown aged throughout the years — Elmo’s gaze darted to the walls of their meeting room after a small meek nod that hinted towards his reservations; gaze scanning the walls built of solid stone that stretched upwards in seemingly endless slabs high enough that it almost seemed as though they were attempting to reach up high enough to the Gods themselves. The air was damp caused by the ongoing storm outside having plagued the House of Tully for days — it made for a mess keeping guard amidst the growing tension between the houses further enabled by the ongoing dispute regarding the throne.      “I do wonder father” Kermit suddenly spoke again interrupting his father’s silence of contemplation as his grip on the hilt of his holstered sword at his hip readjusted the glazed over look in his father’s eyes briefly clearing as he once more looked at him. “If I might…do you think she is ready? I do not wish to rush her into this this is not a decision I think should be lightly considered…”      “Worry not Kermit.” Elmo snapped the anxiety in his chest heavy again at the thought of his daughter shrouded by guilt that he was forced to swallow down. Pride. He released his grip on the ledge of the table made of weirwood and wrung his hands as he paused his brow twitching and inhaling deeply “We have given her more than enough time — all she’s had is time. It is her turn to perform her duty just as we all must.”      Kermit’s gaze shifted blinking a couple of times as he nodded processing his words. There was a silence that fell over them both once more the tension in the air almost suffocatingly thick and crushing him under the weight of it as Kermit thinks of his sister. Thinks of how she will react when he tells her she’s to be married. Thinks of his sweet sister caught in the middle of the politics of the realm — treated as nothing more than a pawn and broodmare; his sweet sister who cried when he brought back his first deer after a hunt when he was twelve big eyes welled with tears and nearly inconsolable. He recalled the days it took for her to speak to him again after that promising to never subject her to such a sight again and do his best to sneak any catch in through the back gates. He thinks of the soft sensitive girl who picked flowers and was fascinated by bugs growing up much to their mother’s dismay — so curious and quiet innocent and in her own world. Kermit wished he could have understood what it was like to see the world through her eyes sometimes to see what it was that she did. Sometimes.      He almost felt dirty at the realization of just who — what — she would be marrying and that he was subjecting his sister to a lifelong commitment to a man who used to throw mud on her dresses; teased her until she cried as a girl and then teased her more because she was a girl. That he was giving her hand away so quickly without giving her even a chance to agree or defend herself or choose — but what choice did a woman have in these matters? Kermit swallowed thickly exhaling as his hands clenched tightly around the hilt of his sword.      Kermit did not have many friends beyond these walls that were not of his own blood. Benjicot Blackwood was one of the very few exceptions — introduced as children both heirs to their respective houses Kermit naturally found himself in the other’s presence more often than not; learning the ways of running households trailing behind their fathers. Hells they had trained together for several years and even fought alongside one another too on a few occasions after run-ins with Brackens. Benjicot had become a close friend of his over the many years they’d known each other coming to know him as soft spoken if not even shy and quiet and still even knowing him and his character as well as he did — the decision still had not been an easy one. But he had mulled over the many available lords and their heirs across the realm thoroughly considering each of them and whether they were suitable for his sister’s hand. No matter how close and good of an ally any of them were how loyal they were how fierce and powerful….Kermit simply could not consider any of them to be good enough for his dear sister. Benjicot hadn’t even been his idea. It had been his father’s idea in fact — he was one of the first names that had been put forward when the discussion had first come up but he had shot it down just as quickly.      He pictured the thought of his sister sweet and soft spoken scared of anything violent and bloody beside Benjicot — wild crazy and psychotic Benjicot whose eyes were wild in battle bordering feral in simple fights that did not require getting bloody pummeling men bloody regardless until they were nearly unrecognizable. The thought made him feel sick to his stomach.      “Do you think…” Kermit began to say cutting himself short as he did not know what he intended to ask. He blinked twice glancing down briefly before looking back up to where his father had turned his head to stare at him. They were both quiet staring back at one another as if they both seemed to be sharing the same thought.      Elmo looked back out the windows looking over the fields that were soaked and flooded by the rains seeming to know what his son intended to say “She will understand.” He stated taking a few steps closer towards the window’s ledge looking up at the sky that was covered by dark full clouds that hid nearly any and all traces of sunlight. “You should be off to speak to her let her know of the news. Lord Samwell will be expecting you in the coming days. I am entrusting you to oversee finalizing everything. Oscar and I will follow.” He explained back turned to him still as he spoke.      Kermit was not one typically to shy away from making difficult choices but this one still felt like he was ripping out a part of himself. Like he had betrayed his sister somehow.      He nodded abruptly bowing his head before taking his leave with a pivot-step and striding out of the room quickly the doors swinging open before slamming shut behind him with the force of the guards stood outside. With a curt nod to the guards Kermit turned and began wandering through the halls; absentmindedly guiding his way to the library his hands clenched so hard his knuckles had turned white and jaw clenched as if that would steady him.      The doors to the library could have otherwise been a comforting sight on any other day given that he had spent several days there in his youth studying and teasing his sister into their adolescence over her obsession to memorize the history books front-to-back rather than being outside with the girls her age; knowing this was her safe haven amongst the busy day-to-day hustle of their house. However it appeared daunting that particular day as he paused outside them hand stretched out and ready to push inside as he listened for any noise; hoping that he would be met instead with silence that he could use as an excuse to walk away and claim that she wasn’t there — that he did not know where she was at that moment. Give him any excuse not to tell her…not yet. But instead he was met by the soft shuffle of shoes and melodic humming his eyes closing with a furrow of his eyebrows as his shoulders slumped sighing out a breath.      It took him a moment to compose himself — straighten his shoulders and stand upright taking one final breath before he pushed open the door to find his sister; her head turning immediately to look at him eyes wide and one hand up to her mouth as she picked at her bottom lip frozen as though he had startled her her humming ceased as her other hand held an open book “Brother?” She suddenly asked voice small amongst the room.      “Sister.” He greeted voice low. “We must speak — join me.”   —      “Winds are coming from the east today.” Benjicot said looking out from the entrance of his tent before letting the flap drop closed shielding him and his cousins from the cool winds that had picked up over the past few hours with the storm; clothes still clinging to his limbs from the rain that had caught him on his way back to camp his hair soaked as it stuck to his forehead in stringy strands that dripped into his eyes. He used the damp backside of his hand to wipe a bead of water from his eyes as he knelt close to the map staying far enough back so as to not damage it by getting it wet as he’d yet to change into something dry. “We can use that to our advantage if this rain slows down.”   “Any animal with even half a brain across the realm has gone into hiding by now there’s nothing left out there.” Emrys said his tone dripping with sarcasm as he sat back on his elbows earning a pointed stare from his cousin. “Let us just call it a day for now. We will continue in the morrow — rest warm up.” He pleaded.      “Don’t be foolish Emrys.” Benjicot snapped while standing back up circling the tent towards his cousin and deliberately nudging him with his rain soaked boot. “A true hunter does not just give up so easily dear cousin. Though I imagine this isn’t how you would rather spend your day — rather instead spend it with your whores yes?” Benjicot mocked the men letting out a chorus of laughter that was muffled by the sound of heavy rainfall.   “Regardless we still might —”  Benjicot’s words were interrupted as a guard arrived calling out to him as he entered the tent where the group of men were meeting “Ser” the guard said stopping abruptly by the entrance and holding out a scroll. “A Raven has just arrived for you.” He announced the scroll dampened by the rain as Benjicot retrieved it from his grasp eyes narrowing slightly at the stoic male who stood still as a statue; awaiting his next orders. His gaze dropped to the scroll in his hands the seal recognized as that of his house and glancing up at the guard once more before cracking the wax seal to unravel the paper his gaze scanning its contents. In his peripheral vision he could see his cousins sit up Emrys to his right.      “Who is it from?” Emrys asked.      Benjicot blinked jaw clenching as he lowered the scroll sighing “My father.” He replied. “He’s instructed us to return to Raventree at once. I’m to be married apparently.” He explained voice just above a mutter as he crumpled up the paper and shoved it into a pocket.,2024-07-14 12:05:27 GMT

He stopped a council meeting to make his master of coin give a pony ride to that annoying ass little boy and it was seen as cute. He made stupid and uninformed decisions when on the throne and people think he’s a good ruler because he’s thinking of the small folk. He killed a dozen innocent rat catchers but he’s acting out of anger and it’s justified because his son was killed by one of them.  Meanwhile young Rhaenyra being disagreeable during a marriage tour makes her a spoiled irresponsible brat her not wanting to be a mother at 14 and go through what her mother did makes her a pick me her expecting to be the queen after her father the ruler of a hereditary monarchy promised her the throne makes her an idiot who didn’t earn her inheritance.   For EVERY single thing she does she’s villainized and seen as unworthy for the throne. If she was the one talking about burning lord Tully and the Riverlands we wouldn’t be hearing the end of how mad and unfit the tyrannical she is. But who gaf if an idiot with a cock says it. No wonder they’ve been writing her the way they do.   And I don’t even want to hear it from you idiots saying “Rhaenyra fans want her to be innocent!!” When the entire fucking planet has been anticipating her cruelty since the premiere. But I also acknowledge that you freaks will tear her apart the minute she does anything controversial meanwhile THE MALE CHARACTERS DO THE ABSOLUTE SAME THING OR WORSE.

73,House of the Dragon,['don’t mind me rambling this might not really make sense'  'my blog is my outlet and all that'  'hotd critical'  'hotd'],adragonprinceswhore,One thing that I’ve realised bug me about how the Greens are written is how easy the writing is.   House of the Dragon wants to portray them as a dysfunctional family that’s unable to offer each other support. Sure I’ll buy that. But they portray this dynamic in the most simplistic way; essentially by having them not interact and simply avoid each other. And yes I get that that’s a way to cope with family trauma but it makes for a really dull TV show.   Imagine the impact confrontation between the Greens would have on the quality of the show? Aegon lashing out at Aemond about Jaehaerys’ murder. Alicent trying to comfort her children but failing because no matter how tight you hug your daughter her son is still dead. Aemond keeping the mask of indifference in front of his family but then it cracks when he walks by Jaehaerys’ chambers.   Now we’re left with lacklustre implications that these characters can’t be there for each other and what that entails. It’s almost as if the writers are telling us “don’t bother feeling bad for the Greens they don’t even feel bad for each other”   You know it’s easier to write an awkward non-verbal interaction than to write a heart-wrenching altercation. Easy writing.,2024-07-14 13:11:31 GMT

I’m so obsessed with them and I haven even watched hotd yet  ✨✨✨  It was a warm evening in Westeros right on the border of the Blackwood and Bracken lands. The air was filled with the scent of the forest and earth and the crickets were chirping their everyday song. Somewhere in the distance a river’s quiet murmuring could be heard.   And in the midst of it all was Davos Blackwood. He was leaning against a tree eyeing a meadow that had became a place in which Blackwoods and Brackens most often met to argue. About boundary stones about the cows not eating their grass and about many other things. It also became a place in which Davos could most often see Aeron Bracken.   Ah yes Aeron Bracken - the boy who was his enemy who was everything his family despised and whom Davos hated. But he also somehow didn’t.   &lt;!-- more --&gt; Because there was also this other side of him that was drawn to the other boy in ways he couldn’t fathom. Every time he saw the golden haired boy he felt this pull towards him the one that filled him with both hatred and desire. And so Davos Blackwood hated Aeron Bracken. He hated that his heart raced every time he saw him hated the way Aeron’s smile froze all his senses. He wanted to push the boy away because maybe just maybe these feelings might disappear turn into nothing but a dream.   But he couldn’t. He was drawn to him like a moth to a flame. How could he feel so strongly for someone who represented everything he was supposed to hate?  He hated Aeron Bracken for making him feel this way confused and divided between his family and his heart. But most of all he hated himself for… loving Aeron for needing him.  Davos tightened his jaw when he saw a familiar figure in the distance. Now came the moment to play his part. Because if he couldn’t have his feelings reciprocated he would make the Bracken boy hate him too. Hatred was still better than indifference after all.   “Lost your way Bracken?” Davos asked coming closer to the other boy. “Or am I so irresistible you just missed me?”  Aeron lifted his chin up a bit. “Dream on Blackwood. If I had any say in it I’d be anywhere but here breathing the same air as a Blackwood.”  “Funny thing” Davos retorted with a smirk on his face. “because your presence here feels like a punishment for some past life sin. What did I do to deserve this?”  Yes Davos thought what did I do to be so close and yet so far? To be right here with Aeron within the arm’s reach and still feel like there was a canyon between them?  “Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk Blackwood?” He asked through gritted teeth anger flashing in his beautiful eyes.   “Not at all.” Davos laughed but it held no trace of joy or fun. “I’m quite an entertaining person you see.”  “Did the whores in brothels tell you that? Because you’re very far from being entertaining trust me. You’re just a pain in my ass nothing more nothing less.”  Davos looked at Aeron for a while. Oh this little shit and his bloody sharp tongue will get him killed some day. The black haired boy quietly promised himself to show this Bracken what a real pain in the ass feels like.  “It’s almost impressive how you manage to be so consistently infuriating. You must practice in front of a mirror.” Said Davos clenching and unclenching his fists. Gods only knew how much he wanted to just push the blond boy against a tree and have his way with him.  Aeron was already opening his mouth to say something when suddenly they heard a rumble of thunder somewhere nearby and a lightning flashed across the sky. The heavens opened up and in seconds the boys were soaked wet clothes sticking to their bodies.   Davos swore under his breath and before he could even think about what he was doing he reached out and gripped Aeron’s hand tightly. The contact making his own body jolt with how right it felt.  “Come on” he said trying to be louder than the rain. “There’s an old shed not far from here. We can hide there.”  Aeron stood completely still for a moment looking at their clasped hands. He could feel the shiver run up his back but he decided that it must have been the rain. It must have… right?  He then tried to pull out of the Blackwood’s hold but the other boy only tightened his grip even more if it was even possible. “Don’t touch me! I’m not going anywhere with you Blackwood!”  “Oh come on we don’t have time for this. We have to get going. You can yell at me all you want later when there’s a roof over our heads.”  Aeron gave it a thought; it was stupid being alone with this specific Blackwood in some shed in the middle of the forest. But then again he was too far from home and it was an even stupider idea to go back in this weather.  He glanced at Davos’ dark eyes and nodded.   Davos didn’t let go of Aeron’s warm and soft hand as he led them through the bushes and muddy ground. Another lightning lit up the sky right before them and they quickened their pace as the thunder rumbled.   Where in the seven hells is this damned shed? he thought it should be right here. Blackwood stopped abruptly causing the blond boy to bump into him.   “Gods you don’t even know where that shed is do you? I knew I shouldn’t trust you Blackwood. You’re so fucking lost right now aren’t you?”  “Shut up Bracken!” Davos yelled turning his head and trying to find his way through the rain and trees. “I’m not lost.”  Finally he decided to turn left. It couldn’t get any worse than it already was anyway. Wet as they were they could wander through the forest some more.  As they ran slipping on the mud the wooden shed loomed into view and Davos wanted to laugh with joy. It was and old structure abandoned for years and dilapidated but still it provided shelter.   Davos pulled Aeron inside and closed the creaking door behind them. The air inside was musty the scent of punk wood mixed with the smell of rain-soaked soil.   Aeron pulled his hand from the other boy’s strong grip his breath coming in short bursts as he looked at him. “Great. Just great. Stuck here with you.”  The boy muttered something more under his nose but began shaking water from his golden locks; Davos had a feeling that he was just cursing him.  “You’re welcome to leave Bracken. The door’s right there if you want to try your luck.” Davos retorted taking off his wet tunic. He could feel Aeron’s intense gaze flickering to his bare chest when he thought he wasn’t looking.   Aeron then began removing his own tunic avoiding Davos’ eyes like the plague. And Davos on the contrary looked at him without a trace of shame. His heart pounded as hid eyes traced the lines of Aeron’s lean and yet muscular body.   “What are you looking at Blackwood?” He snapped though his voice wavered.  Davos stepped closer his pulse quickening. He didn’t want to play this game anymore. “You” he said his voice low and a bit strangled. “You stand here looking so wet and pretty like that and I…”  I can’t help it.  Before Aeron could do or say anything to respond Davos closed the distance between them and crushed his lips onto Aeron’s soft ones with hunger and desperation. It lasted only a second before the blond boy pushed him away with eyes wide with shock.   Oh but how sweet this second was. Davos licked his lips wanting to taste him for another second longer.   “What the Seven hells is wrong with you?” Aeron snapped his chest heaving.   And yet his eyes contradicted his words. Davos could see it clearly: the flick of desire and want. He smirked knowing that he had just won.  “What is wrong with me?” He repeated his voice hoarse and husky. “What’s wrong with you Bracken? You liked it.”  “No I didn’t.” Aeron protested quickly but his faltering voice gave him away.  Davos leaned over the other boy’s face their noses almost touching. He could feel Aeron’s warm breath on his lips.   “You want me to do it again. Admit it. You want this as much as I do.”  Aeron’s breath hitched in his throat. Davos could see the storm of emotions in his eyes similar to the one awaiting them outside. He could see how strife-ridden he was; all the hate ander and underneath them the hunger.   Davos raised his hand and touched the boy’s cheek caressing the soft skin. Aeron whined quietly and in a voice barely above a whisper he said “Yes.”  That one word was all the invitation Davos needed. He surged forward capturing Aeron’s lips in another kiss this one slower and more deliberate. Aeron didn’t push him away this time. Instead he gripped his hands on Davos’ shoulders pulling him even closer.   Their tongues danced together while Davos’ hands roamed over Aeron’s body savoring the feel of his warm soft skin beneath his fingertips.   Davos broke the kiss and trailed his lips down the blond boy’s jaw planting soft kisses along the way. Aeron’s head tilted back a quiet moan escaping his lips as Davos’ mouth moved to his neck sucking gently at his sensitive skin.   “This is wrong” aeron whispered but his grip on Davos only tightened.   “I know” Davos replied and rested his forehead against Aeron’s. “But I don’t care.”  “You know” started Aeron again when they sat on the wooden floor leaning his head on the black-haired boy’s shoulder. “for a Blackwood you are not the worst company.”  Davos laughed at the comment and pressed a gentle kiss to his temple. “And for a Bracken you’re not as hopeless as the rest of your kin.”,2024-07-14 12:59:26 GMT

As the other half messaged &#x27;I watch three current shows - “House Of The Dragon” “Malory Towers” and “Reginald The Vampire.” “Reginald The Vampire” has better acting and “Malory Towers” more believable less cliched villains than &#x27;House Of The Dragon’.   Now &#x27;Vikings: Valhalla’ is back I’ve even less reason to care about a show whose target audience appears to be those dried semen and pot smelling trainwrecks found 24/7 in your local Geek Retreat.’  (For the benefit of our non-British viewers Geek Retreat is a franchise of cafes which offers the opportunity for people to play boardgames card games RPGs etc. which expanded fast and contracted even faster largely because each franchise discovered it couldn’t compete against the existing &#x27;geek/nerd’ cafes and bars that had been offering the same for years except miles cheaper because they weren’t based on the main streets of cities and towns where the rates are eye-watering. Oh and weren’t having to pay a big &#x27;franchise fee’ either)  Ouch!  Know how they feel. How can a show on such a budget prove to be such a crushing disappointment?  How can a show be made on such a scale where you seriously couldn’t care less about any of the characters post the departure of Milly Alcock (the fact they keep having to get her in cameo flashbacks says it all).  Every single one of them is a dreadful cliche the worst of them being - no prizes for guessing …  Prince Aemond Targaryen the One Eyed Chin who may as well grow a silly moustache to twirl every time he does some utterly predictable piece of villainy.  What? He has designs on the throne for himself? Wow.  He kills his own brother in a battle whilst making it look like an accident? We never say that one coming.  Old Chinnochio’s major character motivation is the chips on his shoulder from a disability and being a creepy pervert meaning he wants power so no one will dare make fun of him again? That really sets him apart from all the other characters …  *** cough! ***  &#x27;House Of The Dragon’ has a budget inversely proportionate to the originality entertainment it has to give.  It is just one series of tired old tropes after another done far better before by more talented actors and producers who had to try harder rather than shrug their shoulders and smirk &#x27;oh well the CGI will get us out of trouble - and if they don’t we can always throw in some tits and bum to spike the ratings’ It’s like Tinseltown’s been taken over by those same butt lazy students who relied on AI bots and essay mills to get their grades.  George R R Martin like J K Rowling has proven someone who is good at cutting pasting and contemporizing better writer’s work but is left floundering around like a beached cod the moment those sources dry up.

Gwyane’s Version ❄ Daemon’s Version ❄ Aegon’s Version ❄ Aemond’s Version ❄ Jacaerys’ Version ❄ Cregan’s Version ❄ Criston’s Version  Cregan Stark x Reader | 900&lt; | cw: fem!reader angst blood injuries death typos etc.  A/N: renee rapp my beloved  Cregan did not wed you because he was drawn by your bright eyes. He did not wed you because your smile could melt a hole through the ice that held up the Wall. No he wed you because your house and his were long strained and taking you as his wife would ensure peace between you.  He wed you because it was his duty though he could not deny that he would soon come to love you for the prior things mentioned. But how could he when it was never brought up?  &lt;!-- more --&gt; As far as anyone knew as far as you knew your husband did you well simply because he was your husband.  Being the youngest of your family you were rather neglected. You knew little beyond entertaining yourself and others with simple humor and preposterous ideas. Winterfell would come to adore the warmth that was borne from the coldness of your youth. They would do the same in how easily amused their lady was of the Northern coldness.  You loved the snow but were fundamentally useless in it knowing nothing beyond making snowmen. You knew not how to start a fire nor build a tent; you did not know which flora to forage either much less how to hunt.  Cregan did not fault you for it for it was not your fault you were not taught. But he did not appreciate how you took more importance in chatting with his men than learning these skills; he tells you as much.  “But what you ask of me is your job” you simply respond “mine is to keep the spirits lifted.”  He huffs breath turning into fog “it would do you well to learn. What if there is no fire and no one who knew how to make one?”  “Then I ask if you plan to leave me to fend for myself my lord?”  He tilts his head jaw muscle feathering in offence “do you think so little of me?”  “I thank the gods daily for supplying me with such a reliable husband” you smile “and I pray the day will never come that I need to fend for myself.”     Part of him is endeared by your darling naiveté another is frustrated by it. He figures if he cannot convince you to learn then he will make nature your teacher.  He instructs one of the servants to take you berry picking and to leave you somewhere that is not too close but not too far from Winterfell. The servant obeys her lord and does just that. She slips away from you through the foliage making sure to leave you any tools or weapons you would need.  You were left completely unware treading deeper and deeper into the forest following where the berry bushes went. You were too wrapped up in your singing to realize you were completely alone.  That is until you heard a wolf howling.  You did not know where you were going. You did not know which way was North or South or which way Winterfell laid. All you knew was you wanted to go home with your basket of berries but that seemed impossible when you dropped them into the ground with a deafening scream. Your leg had been snagged into something. You writhe in pain finding your shin caught in the jaw of a bear trap. Your hot tears turn into frost and your breath grows shorter and shorter in panic.  Cregan was not one to worry. He patiently waited for you by the gates of your home anticipating that you’d be the next one to come around. But it was never you… and then it started to snow.  He calls a search party for you. He hears many a man call out your name as the night begins to take the forest. At the same time the ground became slowly whiter and whiter while his worry thickened at a more rapid pace. Soon his hair and shoulders were frosted over and his source of light no longer came from the sky but a torch in his hand.  “MY LORD!”  Cregan perks and run towards the man calling for him. He quickly reaches him and looks around for you but you stood nowhere. He sees the man remove his fur hat and lower his gaze.  By the old gods.  He drops to his knees. The snow scatters revealing the red that laid underneath. He brushes off your body rigid and cold. He releases a horrified sound at the sight of your mangled leg. He cradles you in his arms and rushes you back home.  The maesters assure him you were still breathing and that there was hope for you yet. They might save your life but you would lose your leg.  Cregan laments as the maesters operate on you. He seeks absolution by the weirwood tree and vows to serve you ardently more ardently so long as your life is spared.  For a moment the old gods looked upon Cregan Stark. They delivered his wife. You lived… if you could call it that.  You wake up to the face of your husband who immediately weeps at your side begging you for your forgiveness. You clutch his cheek and tell him “there is nothing to forgive.”  But there is and he would never forgive himself for how you never smiled at the snow again or how you died midday as children made snow angels outside your window.,2024-07-14 14:25:49 GMT

If she was tender and loving and supportive to Aegon you’d all hate her anyway saying she’s an apologist for his behavior and an enabler. “But she put him on the throne” she wasn’t going to until she fully believed that Viserys asked her to.

662,House of the Dragon,['team green'  'anti team black'  'anti rhaenyra targaryen'],aryas-faces,HotD + Sanitizing Rhaenyra Targaryen In the show’s desperation to make Rhaenyra the hero they have actually made Rhaenyra the worst character which is a travesty because book Rhaenyra is one of the best ASOIAF villains in my opinions  What went wrong with show Rhaenyra? Well for one thing they are never going to make her the villain it seems. Despite the end of season 1 making it seem like they were going that route. But looking back at season 1 we should have seen this coming  Rhaenyra didn’t kill Laenor she let him escape. Rhaenyra didn’t feed Vaemond to Syrax she had no say in his death. They don’t make it clear what she means by wanting Aemond to be “questioned sharply.” She’s innocent in all the above  And not only that but they have set the story as a feminist crisis and not a succession crisis. This was the worst misstep they could have taken. Because not only Rhaenyra immediately sympathetic but there is no chance they can go the book Rhaenyra route now because it would misogynistic. Imagine: A story about a woman’s power and throne being taken from her because she is a woman. A victim of the patriarchy. And then she becomes a tyrant and proves the sexist men right. That would be a terrible story  The book is not feminist story about a worthy woman being abused by the patriarchy. It’s about how power corrupts people. And Rhaenyra is the biggest villain in the story. If they went the book Rhaenyra route she would be rewarding her council for Blood and Cheese. She would say “I will have my throne or my half brother’s head.” She would never offer to go Rook’s Rest just tell Rhaenys to go. Book Rhaenyra and show Rhaenyra are two completely different people  And here is why I’m worried about season 3. There is no way to adapt the Rhaenyra Triumphant/Overthrown chapters without making her the villain. So either they are going to the book route and have people break out in anger the same they did with Daenerys or somehow make it not her fault   Either way they have written themselves into a corner,2024-07-14 15:25:30 GMT

Playlist:  Once Upon a Dream~ Lana Del Rey  Steal My Girl~ One Direction   Call It What You Want~ Taylor Swift  Warnings: female reader. Nothing else I don’t think. Just pure fluff.  Y/N tripped towards the Brackentree the next day in high spirits her heart soaring at the confirmation that her love for her Blackwood knight was requited turning over in mind the events of the previous afternoon and the memory of Benjicot’s smile as he kissed her hand at the border of the Bracken lands when they parted.  Buoyed by a newfound confidence the source of which she could only locate in the weeks she had spent in Benjicot’s company she was surprised to see the glint of his sword leaning against their empty tree. Confused at the absence of the knight where his sword was she placed her hand on the trunk of the tree and began to look around it for signs of when he might have been there. As she leaned around the tree a hand took hold of her own on the tree trunk and placed something around her finger. Startled she turned rapidly to see the amused yet soft smile of Benjicot still holding her hand in his.   Smiling indulgently at him she looked down at her hand in his to see a burnished gold band encrusted with a deep garnet gem sparkling on the second finger of her left hand.   Seeing Y/N’s quizzical expression he pulled her hand gently towards him raising it to wrap her arm around his neck before reaching out with his other arm to encircle her waist closing the distance between them.  “Do you like it?” he asked with a reverential tone.  “It’s beautiful but why are you giving it to me?”  Chuckling indulgently and lightly pinching her cheek he opened his palm to hold her face before responding.  “Unless you are planning on lancing me through the heart by renegading on your promise to marry me yesterday I had hoped that the future Lady Blackwood would like to possess an heirloom of the House she is soon to belong to.”   Looking once again in wonder at the gem on her finger she looked up at Benjicot with an expression of complete joy surprising him by reaching up with both hands to encircle his neck in an embrace that lifted her off the ground as he delightedly caught her and spun her in a circle increasing speed as she began to laugh.  Reluctantly returning her to the ground he continued to hold her in her embrace both arms enclosed around her lower back as he gaze down at the light of his life.  “If I had known that I would be rewarded with such a response to a small trinket I would have sacked my ancestral halls long before now and demanded you take your pick.”  Laughing at this and swatting at his chest Y/N beamed up at him.  “It feels as if it is real now. That you really do love me and wish for me to be your lady.”  His face falling slightly at this he pulled her closer towards his chest trying to get as close to her as possible.  “It is real. I do love you. I do wish for you to be my lady most desperately. So much so that I should be most put out if you backed out now” he returned in a tone that made it sound like a sally but held a depth of love and a fear that she may be retracting her earlier acquiescence to his proposal.   Smiling softly up at him and grasping his hand in her now bejewelled hand she assured him “I won’t change my mind.”  “I am relieved to hear it” he returned in a voice that held no mirth in it his sigh giving away his genuine contentment at her assurance that he was not in fact to be lanced through the heart.  Lightening his tone he continued “it is of course a relief to be told that I am still for this world.”  “You’re so dramatic Benji!” she laughed again swatting at him again as he sought to conceal from his expression how endearing he found these light touches so indicative of them were they of her growing confidence in his love. He could also not deny that the lack of force she put into them was very sweet and only serve to strengthen his desire to protect such gentleness.   “Is that so?” he jested “my lady does not care for my wellbeing then” he sighed dramatically turning from her as if in high sorrow.  “She does not then love me as I love her. Alas what misery I shall go forwith and put myself to the sword.”  Grabbing his arm Y/N looked up at Benji with fear in her eyes and it was all he could do not to either laugh or kiss her so concerned did she look by his blatant antics.   Continuing the charade he moved away from her with great reluctance.  “Life has lost all meaning for me now there is nothing to be done. I must depart from it.” He sighed again with great drama.   Continuing to stride away from her he began to count in his head secretly hoping she would stop him so that he could again take her in his arms and end the game little expecting her to grab him so abruptly causing them both to lose their footing.  Turning himself quickly and wrapping his arms around her waist so that he landed on the ground cushioning her fall onto his chest he quickly lifted his head to check on her condition.  Raising them both so that he could hold her head and examine her face checking for any sign of tears or distress that might reveal she had hurt herself he was relieved to see that she looked confused but unharmed. That was before she fixed him with a glare and pushed herself up away from him.  “You were jesting the whole time you rogue.”   Pushing himself up with a laugh he returned “that may be so but I cannot be sorry for it when you so sweetly came to defend my life and then rewarded me by falling into my arms once again.”  Secretly rejoicing at the pink blush rising in her cheeks he winked at her before leaning towards her to place a chaste kiss on her brow.   Hovering over the place in which he had planted a kiss conveying all the reverence and admiration he held for her into it he spoke lowly and earnestly.  “I do mean what I say even when I jest with you. It’s essential to me that you love me…that you will let me love you.

(@sixofyeet just in case)  (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Baela has been betrothed to Jacaerys Velaryon for as long as she can remember. She can’t remember a time when there wasn’t something telling her “That’s unproper of a lady. Prince Jacaerys won’t like that.”  But she is her father’s daughter.  She stands at a cliff on Dragonstone aiming her crossbow at the wood foundation Jace appears from behind the rocks.   “You missed supper” he calls as he walks towards her.   “I wasn’t hungry.”  “I don’t think anyone was really. Too many empty seats.”  She fires her crossbow watching the arrow land solidly in the wood. She hears the clatter of his sword against his leg as she reloads. The Prince won’t like women who fight.  “Do you know where he went?” Baela asks.   She’d watched her father leave without so much as a word. Just as he always does.   “Harrenhal I would think.” Jace stands next to her watching her aim.  She pretends she’s aiming at Father’s head. “Sometimes I think I hate him.” The arrow goes flying.  “It’s hard…with fathers” her betrothed says looking at her with kindness.   She’s never been looked upon with only kindness by a man before but she revels in it. She revels in him.  “What do you remember of my uncle?” she says dropping her weapon to her side turning her head to gaze at Jace.  A smile plays upon his lips. “He taught us to catch fish and sing sea shanties. He had a weakness for cake.”  Baela licks her lips. “And Ser Harwin Strong?”  “He was gentle and fierce. They called him ‘Breakbones.’”   She lays the crossbow on the grass and walks to the very edge of the cliff and carefully sits herself down. She flicks her legs back and forth as she looks over her shoulder to see Jace approaching. He sits next to her their legs pressed together.   They’ve never been so close before not truly. She was on Driftmark for too many years and now that she’s here he’s needed everywhere around Dragonstone.   “He loved us I think” he continues.  Her brow twists. How could anyone not love them? Love him? “Of course he did.”  Jace sighs. He allows his back to slouch as he stares out into the sea. “I miss Luke.”  Baela stares at his profile studying the curve of his nose and lips and how his hair curls over the tops of his ears. And she imagines him younger.   She will never miss Lucerys Velaryon as much as anyone else on this island but she misses him nonetheless. They had wonderful times together as children and he made Rhaena happy.  She places her head on Jace’s shoulder. “I miss him too.”  “I want Aemond Targaryen dead” he says.  “I know” she says too.  She lifts her head and grabs his face to look at her. His brown eyes mourn his brother and she can see herself reflected in them. “You will have your revenge. Aemond will die.”  “How can you be so sure?” Jacaerys whispers.  Baela smirks. “Because I am a woman.”  Jace huffs out a laugh. “Only you.”  “What?” she demands playfulness making her eyes bright. “It is true! A woman knows these things!”  Jace laughs harder a fist coming to block his mouth as wheezes leave him.   Without a thought she reaches out to hold his hand and bring it down from his smile. “Don’t hide it” she says softly. “Laughter is hard to come by these days. I want to welcome it.”  Jace looks at her something soft brewing on his face. She wants to kiss him.  Sure she’s kissed servant boys at her time on Driftmark but never did they make her want. Not the way he does.  It grips her soul and makes her heart pound. Baela can’t help the way her eyes drop to his lips before she catches his eyes again. She knows he saw it.  She pulls away clearing her throat. She removes her hand from his placing it in her lap. She changes the topic. “What shall your mother do while Father is away?”  “Lead” he says simply.  “The council? Of power-hungry lords who wish to exact revenge on other houses with the excuse of our dragons?” Baela scoffs. “Very wise indeed.”  “Are you questioning Her Grace the Queen?” Jacaerys teases.  “Never. But I am questioning those she surrounds herself with.”  The conversation dies there. Together they sit in silence listening to the waves crash against the beach.  “Baela” Jace says after a long while. “While I was North I-“  Please don’t say you found someone. Please.  “I’ve come to realize that perhaps I haven’t been good to you” he confesses.   She jerks her head to look at him. What is he talking about? “What?”  “I watched Lord Stark and his wife. They are quite in love” he says. “And I fear…”  “Jacaerys if you are worried that I want another I do not” Baela says. “I am betrothed to you.”  “Yes but I have not been here. How could I ask you to wait for me when we are married when this is how we live now?”  “Because it is now.” She reaches to touch his face turning it gently. “When the war is over we will be together.”  He stares at her and this time she can’t read him. She’s never not been able to see his expressions and not know what they meant.  But she sees the way his eyes are trailing over her face before landing on her lips. They don’t return to her eyes.  Baela tilts her head up the slightest bit. He leans closer to her their lips a breath apart. The want coils in her gut. She wants to push him onto his back and take him right there on the cliff make him hers in every way she can and demand they marry within the fortnight. But this is not what a lady does. A lady does not take.  But a lady does give.  She closes the gap between them with a brush of her lips against his and whatever had stopped him before is gone.  His hands bury themselves in her hair as he presses his lips against hers with fervor spreading them apart to lick into her mouth. A noise leaves her and his hand trails from her face to her waist. He grips her there holding her steady.   She places a hand on Jace’s chest leaning into him. They kiss harder air becoming rare in their lungs.   She wants to give him everything she is. All that she will be.  He pulls away from her his breathing hard. She opens her eyes and finds that his lips are red with the slightest swell.   “I wish to marry you” he says gruffly.  “And I you.”  He kisses her again softer. Something like a promise.   “Avy jorrāelan” Jacaerys whispers.  She drops her head to his chest and feels his arms wrap around her.  Here on this cliff they are alone and content.   Avy jorrāelan.,2024-07-14 16:42:18 GMT

One night they happen upon Aemond behind one of the curtains the rest is history.   18+ ONLY MDNI Targcest smut polyamory   Aegon Targaryen x Velaryon (Strong)! Reader  Aemond Targaryen x Velaryon (Strong)! Reader  Part 1 | Part 2  Over the next weeks Y/N finds herself in Aemond’s arms rather than the rooms of the pleasure house.   True to his word he beds her and sends her off with a kiss to her brow. “Good evening your grace.”  Y/N hesitates at the open door. “How did you stop?”  “Stop what?”  “Caring for me how did you stop?”  “Are you not well tended?” Aemond cocks his head to the side.  “I am.”  “You are in want of a friend not a husband.” Aemond reminds her “unless you’ve had a change of heart.”  &lt;!-- more --&gt; “I have asked the gods for a sign so they might guide my hand. My heart has changed my mind has not.” Y/N swallows brushing past him to the hall. She makes for her rooms calming her nerves with a bath.   That is where Aegon finds her dropping to his knees at the tub side. “I need to speak with you.”  The princess nods bringing her face closer to his. “What is it?”  “I love you.” Aegon tells her “and I have not behaved as such.”  “In what way my love?”   “I want to help you in court.”   “You do not need to.”  Aegon shakes his head “I do. It is no secret that I would be just as happy living with you as farm hands. Happier even than I am here.”  Y/N nods.  “But I was not born a farmer. I was born a prince and you were born heir to the throne. You have such ambition I may never understand. I wish rather to be here with our children.”  “I do not fault you for wanting to father our children. It is noble of you and I love you all the more for it.” Y/N assures him.  “I have left you so often alone in this.” Aegon passes his hand over her hair. “I will study the histories not because I enjoy them but because it is what you deserve.”  “I am moved by this Aegon. Truly.” Y/N’s face softens.  “And if it is Aemond you want to stand beside you in these matters I welcome him. You know the Conqueror had two wives.” Aegon presses kisses to her fingers curled round the lip of the tub.   “I will shower you in fine jewels and clothing from every corner of the realm.” Show you the sweetness of undying love “bear you a hundred children.”  Aegon chuckles “and I shall adore each of them.”  She nuzzles his nose with her own. “I’ve no wish to change you I need you to know that. Aemond is not nor will he ever be a replacement for you. You are my first love you always will be.”  “And you are mine.” Aegon murmurs “I did not know I was capable of loving until I loved you. I still grapple with it at times.”  Y/N understands pecking a kiss to his lips.   “Almost as though we were one before we were two.” Aegon laments. “My cock does not get half as hard for any lady. I’ve raised this matter with the maester.”  Y/N cannot contain the sound that escapes her the both of them dissolving into laughter until their sides ache. Foreheads knocking together as they attempt to catch their breath. “The m-maester-” she can’t even get the word past her lips without cackling.  “Hush you.” Aegon smiles.  Before anything else Aegon is her dearest friend.  ————————————————————————  Weeks later Aemond is asked to join Y/N in her chambers he is not expecting to find his brother there pacing behind her chair.  “I am with child.”  Oh.   “Do not look so surprised brother. Surely you know how the act is done.”  “I…” Aemond trains his gaze on Y/N.   “I told you I asked the gods for a sign.” Y/N breathes wringing her hands. “There is no clearer a sign than this.”  Aemond kneels before her taking her hands. “This child will be just as much mine as Aegon’s?”  Aegon narrows his eyes “that is the idea.”  Y/N nods. “We spoke about it at length we would prefer Aegon tend the children while I am performing my duties with you at my side. If you so desire. He is better suited than any maid. He is their father their blood.”  “An honorable proposition.” Aemond agrees “our children should be grateful for it.”  “Yes then?” Y/N asks.  Aemond purses his lips “mayhaps I should allow you to wonder a while.”  “Rightfully so if you do.” Y/N agrees “I have made a mess of this.”  His eye flickers about her face “I trust you will find a way to make it up to me.”  She smiles “of course.”   Aemond pecks her once on the lips before rising to his feet and returning to his rooms.  ————————————————————————  The ceremony does not take long to organize. So long as Aemond is good to her Aegon is content. When you truly love something there is little desire to tear it apart.  The children do not fully understand this new arrangement but they are happy to have a second pony for rides and a spare shoulder to cry on when they are hurt. Aemond’s presence is a comfort to them.  He regularly reads to their eldest daughters Dahlia and Visera as Aegon and Y/N attend their young sons Laenor and Aegon IV. Who are too little to appreciate such knowledge.   Aemond closes the book as they reach a stopping point. It is nearly time for dinner and his head begins to ache. “That is all for now.”  “Just one more Aemond?” Visera pleads clasping her hands together.  “On the morrow” he promises lowering his leg until she slides off his lap.  The little girl huffs setting off to join her parents. Aegon welcomes her with open arms catching her nose between his fingers and pretending to steal it.   Dahlia turns to Aemond watching his family with a grimace. “I quite like having two fathers.”  “And why is that?” Aemond wonders pressing a finger to his throbbing temple.  “Papa is the fun one and you are the stern one.” Dahlia begins toying with the strap of his eye patch.  Aemond hums moving her hand away. “Is that what you think of me?”  Dahlia squishes his cheeks between her little hands. “You are always scowling.”  “Not always.”   Dahlia smiles and Aemond returns the gesture. “Now with your teeth.”  Aemond bares his teeth to her.  Dahlia leans away from him “never you mind.”  Aegon grins at his girl “Dahlia let us ready for supper my dearest love.”  Dahlia jumps down wrapping around her father’s leg like some sort of animal.   Aegon smiles lifting her and his leg with some difficulty.   “I’m going to lie down a while.” Aemond excuses himself past the giggling children.   Laenor points to his mother’s rounded belly “a babe.”  “That’s right my love.” Y/N smiles “should you like a brother or sister?”  The corners of the boy’s mouth turn down as his brows raise in an expression so like his father’s. “Brother.”  “A brother” Y/N passes a hand over his silver hair. “That would be very nice wouldn’t it?”  ————————————————————————  Y/N knocks once upon the door of Aemond’s apartments.   “Who goes there?” His voice carries out toward the hallway.   “Me.”   “Come.” Aemond purrs.  Y/N makes her way into his rooms finding him in the tub shrouded by soft candlelight. “We missed you at dinner I thought I’d look in on you.“  &quot;I apologize for my absence I am not feeling well.”  “It is no issue husband. Although the children did ask for you.” Y/N tells him “Aegon was forced to give pony rides alone.”  “And he survived?”  “He was quite sore after. I slapped him once on the behind like a true steed and rubbed his back until he fell asleep.”  “I am sure he appreciates your efforts.” Aemond drawls “I hope to be half the father he is.”  “Even I am not as good a mother as he is a father. It is a learned skill for most of us Aegon was born with it.” Y/N runs her finger along the length of his scar. The sapphire long removed in his discomfort.  “Come to this side. I want to see you.”  Y/N shuffles to the opposite side of the tub.   “I hope I have not repulsed you with-”  Y/N huffs “I would lave it with my tongue if you allow me.”  “There are many places I’d rather be laved wife.”  Y/N leans into his hand as it comes up to the side of her face.  “Join me I wish to say hello to our little dragon.”  “Surely that is your motivation.” She arches a brow tugging at the laces of her gown.  Aemond cocks his head to the side. “If you were wed to the fairest princess in the Seven Kingdoms you would understand. You are not a want you are a need.”   Y/N sighs climbing into the tub. “So long as you do not touch my breasts I will not complain. They are terribly painful.”  “Mayhaps the water will help.” Aemond makes room for her between his legs. Resting with her back to his chest he lies one hand upon her belly the other stroking her hair.   “Nothing helps.”  Beneath his splayed fingers Aemond feels the child stir against his palm. “You need no more heirs.”  “I should like to bear you a child.” She admits with a hand over his.  “You are.” He assures her “if it is Aegon’s or mine this child is all I need.”  “I do not foresee an absence of love making in my future.”  “There is always moon tea.”  “You do not wish for more children?”  “I do not wish for you to suffer.” He brushes the underside of her breast with his thumb and she hisses. “Turn around for me.”   Y/N shuffles around straddling his hips. Tracing gently along his scar “is this what troubles you?”  “It aches from time to time.”  She rubs lightly at his temples “when my head aches Aegon does this for me. I find it helps.”  Aemond hums allowing his eyes to close she kisses along his brow. Dulling the throbbing pain until he chases her lips with his own.   The princess smiles against his mouth as his hand moves lower past her belly to cup her sex.   He slips a finger inside his cock standing at attention.   “Please.”   “You will have everything you want.” He vows lifting her hips carefully to position himself at her entrance.  She takes him to the hilt stinging at the stretch. “Fuck.”  “I know sweetling.” Aemond breathes. “Must be torturous; so loved by anyone to ever know you. What magic are you made of?”  Y/N leans toward him panting into his mouth brows furrowed as she rocks against him. “I do not know.”  He traces her parted lips with his thumb. “We’re going to be a proper family. Like the conquerors the three of us together. All this child will know is love. Mine and Aegon’s.”  “Thank you.”  “My only request is that you visit me more than one night to his ten.”  Y/N huffs a laugh “you will be no Visenya. Sooner than late it will be our story they tell. Mayhaps we should join our beds together make room for all of us.”  “So long as Aegon does not touch me” Aemond agrees “I will surely heave.”  “His thoughts are much the same.”   Droplets of water cling to her skin falling from her nipples so sweetly Aemond finds it a crime not to feast upon them. “We must renegotiate the terms of your breasts.”  She whines allowing him to cup them in his hands. “Please Aemond.”  “Shh” he draws her nearer taking her nipple into his mouth.   She claws at his shoulders as his tongue flicks over the hardened peak. “I will die.”  Aemond hums low in his throat feeling her come undone. Wailing as her cunt pulses sinfully around him. “Mērī mirrī morghon syt ao dōna riña.” Only a little death for you sweet girl.  Y/N brings an arm across to cover her breasts after returning from her voyage to the stars. “They hurt you awful man.” She frowns.  “I could not help myself.” Aemond uses his hold on her hips to keep her moving until he empties his spend.   When he is finished Y/N reaches out of the tub for her dress.  “Where do you think you’re going?”   “I brought you something” Y/N remembers. Catching the jewels between her fingers; an emerald and a ruby shimmer against her palm. “This is all they had for now but I have requested a diamond and there is also a purple stone I can’t recall the name of.”  “For me?” Aemond blinks at her.   “All custom cut of the finest quality.” Y/N tells him. “I thought you might like to try something new.”  “Do you not like the sapphire? You never wear your necklace.”  “I love the sapphire and my necklace.” Which Aegon went to great lengths to repair. “This is merely a gift to show love and appreciation for you my lord husband.”  “Love?” Aemond’s eye finds hers.   Y/N nods.

Reader  18+ non con/rape   Do not read if this will trigger you.   “Bring her to me!” Aegon screamed as he threw his cup roughly against the wall wine splattering on the stone as soldiers panicked to try to appease the King.  Y/n ran through the corridors her boots slamming against the stone as she tried to get to the dragonpit praying she could get to her baby before the guards found her. Her hands grabbing on the wall as she threw herself towards the stairs almost falling down as she caught herself and continued rushing.   “Please please.” Y/n begged to herself as she heard the clattering of armour as Knights guards and anyone who could answered the King’s demands to bring him his Queen. Y/n could feel the blisters ripping open the backs of her feet stone scraping against delicate skin as she shoved herself off walls to propel herself forward anything to avoid being captured. She let out a scream as a Guard appeared his sword drawn as she heard more footsteps behind her.  “NO! Kill me! Kill me if you plan to take me please.” Y/n begged as she turned Sir Criston Cole staring at her with a smirk as he stared down Rhaenyra’s daughter his sword drawn as he twirled it.  “My Queen we would never think of betraying the throne in such a way. Please come with us peacefully the King requires your presence.” Y/n could feel her heart sink as she surveyed her choices she would be damned if she was taken easily back to that monster. She heard a chuckle as she spun Aemond standing there with a cat-like grin.  “Niece pray tell what are you doing?” Y/n scowled at him as she stood tall and proud.  “You arrogant pest you despise your King and yet you stand here returning the one thing he covets instead of allowing me to leave. You are as foolish as you are bitter.” Y/n spat her words Aemond drawing his sword and pointing it towards her as he raised an eyebrow and walked closer.  “I am returning the one thing that controls him the one thing that he can control although if you were my Pet this escape attempt would have never happened.” Y/n grit her teeth as Aemond called her a Pet she was sick and tired of this charade that everyone in the Seven Kingdoms adored Aegon. She despised him as much as Aemond but where his was out of jealousy hers was pure hatred.   “You are a coward.” Y/n raised her chin as she spoke the last word staring deeply into his eye as she felt the sword under her chin.  “And you are not? You could have thrown yourself from a window or poisoned yourself and yet here you are running in circles for attention.” Y/n grabbed the sword throwing Aemond off guard as she held the blade tightly pushing his balance off and grabbing his long white hair. Dragging him to the ground as his sword hit the floor Criston Cole holding his hand up as the two tousled on the floor before Aemond was ontop. His eyepatch ripped off as he pinned Y/n beneath him her body thrashing wildly as he held her hands together and used his other hand to grip her hair.  “You fucking whore.” Aemond ground out as he banged her head against the stone flooring her eyes rolling as she cried out in pain and her wiggling slowed.   “Atleast someone wants me.” Y/n whispered as she concentrated on Aemond seeing the fire in his eyes as he climbed off her and forced her up his grip on her arm bruising as he pushed her back towards the throne room.   “I hope he strings your body up and your pathetic mother hears of your death.” Y/n spat on his boots before he threw her down in front of the throne gritting her teeth as her knees slammed against the stone.   “My beautiful wife!” Aegon cheered as she glared at Aemond before looking up at Aegon with a blank face.  “Aegon.” The King pouted at her coldness climbing off the throne where he had been lounging and walked towards her with his hands on his hips.  “That is no way to speak to your loving husband Y/n. I was so worried for you.” His eyes wide and innocent as he crouched before her his hand coming to hold her face tenderly before glaring at Aemond.  “You have bruised her.” Aemond rolled his eye as Y/n moved away from Aegon’s touch his eyes filled with hurt at her actions.  “My darling let us retire and i shall look after you.” Y/n was pulled up by guards much gentler than before with their King watching Aegon linking her arm with his as he walked her towards their quarters.  “My angel why why did you run?” Aegon questioned Y/n as they walked her nails digging into her palm as they entered the chambers. The door closing before she was pushed onto the bed Aegon’s eyes filled with tears as he crawled onto her and stared into her eyes.  “Why why my darling?” Y/n could only stare back at him as tears fell from his eyes his body wracked with sobs as he held her.  “I have done nothing but love you I love you so much it burns me and yet you spur me so.” Y/n laid still as she breathed deeply his head in her chest as he pinned her with his weight.  “You do not love me Aegon. You are obsessed with me. You are a spoilt brat who became King by being a Usurper perhaps in another life i could have loved you but not in this one.” Aegon continued to sob as he shook his head refusing to believe her words.  “No no you love me. You told me.” Y/n clenched her fists as Aegon’s sobs turned into gentle kisses across her chest her body shivering in disgust.  “You told me you told me you loved me.” He kept repeating to himself as he peppered kissing along her breasts and collarbone working his way up until he could stare in her eyes. His confidence in her was restored as he wiped his eyes and smiled down at her.  “You told me do you remember?” Y/n wanted to cry as she watched him in his madness.  “I was 12.” Aegon did not care as he only widely smiled and nodded his heart soaring at the thought of her holding the memory close.  “Yes! You told me you loved me and that you wished to stay with me.” Y/n felt a tear escape her eye as she recalled the dreaded beginning of his obsession. It was after Aemond had taken Vhagar and she had told Aegon she loved him as her Uncle and that she wished they could be friends. Instead he had turned her childish words into a declaration. Now the words repulsed her she could not think of anything worse than saying those words to Aegon to appease him in such a way.   “You never have to wish for that again my wife. You will be with me forever.” His kisses turned harsher as he claimed her lips pressing her into the mattress as his hunger took over mumbling her name over and over and he pushed up her dress.  “My beautiful wife.”  His hands pushed her legs apart.  “You are stunning.”   She could feel his forehead against hers as he gripped her hips.  “I love you.”   She stared at the ceiling as she tried to imagine herself anywhere else.   “I know you love me.”   The pain made her wince.  “Gods say you love me.”   His body was sweaty as he held her close.  “Going to keep you forever.”  His hands fumbled to grab hers as he kissed her.  “So…so beautiful.”   She could feel him stutter could tell his hair would be sticking to his forehead and body would be shaking.  “All mine.”  She wanted to sigh in relief as he groaned.  “Say it.” His voice demanded as he gripped her chin and forced her to look at him. Her eyes were empty and hollow as she spoke.  “I’m yours.”   Y/n sat on Aegon’s lap the crown haphazardly placed on her head as he thrust up into her her hands trying not to get cut on the iron throne as she stared at the metal behind his head. His moans and words not registering in her mind as he held her hips forcing her further down as she contained the whimper of pain.   “Gods you were made for me.” Aegon moaned out his arms moving to wrap around her waist as he pulled her down cumming harshly as he forced her to stay on top of him. His breathing evening out as Y/n placed her head on his shoulder in shame one of his hands coming to push his hair out his face.  “Ride with Vhagar to Rook’s Rest follow Sir Criston.”   “Of course brother.”  She was trapped.,2024-07-14 19:25:44 GMT

Aemond Targaryen was a vampire with a thousand years of age and centuries of history. He was one of a family of supreme vampires many lives he had taken and too little eternal life he had given to others.     There were a few characteristics that made him different from the others.     Aemond drank blood exclusively from glasses and bowls. In order not to touch the victim unnecessarily he made a cut along the veins on his arm and poured the blood into the bowls for he was very squeamish and would not leave a mess or touch the victim with his lips unnecessarily. If he had a desire to get closer to the victim through tactile contact he gave a gift. After all something caused him an impulse to touch and for these desires he granted eternal life.     He chose his victims solely on the basis of odor. Most often they were women who cared and looked after themselves from whom a pleasant aroma emanated. It is the aroma and body odor that is meant not the scent of oils that were commonly worn on the skin of the body at that time (as in the movie “Perfumer”). Sometimes his victims were young men whose skin had not yet had time to coarsen from the work and drudgery of life. And he also chose young men by their fragrance they were guys who did not do hard work because the smell of testosterone and sweat strongly repulsed him.      Heleft himself different kinds of jewelry with crystals and precious stones which most likely meant a lot to the victims. Some of these stones he offered in payment to the gods for for his sins.,2024-07-14 20:54:06 GMT

The people around him treat him like he owes them the throne and need to be thankful for it when he never wanted it. Aegon was leading a happy life exploiting his royal status as a Targaryen prince: drinking the best wine eating the best food riding a dragon whoring around playing with his children and graping servant girls with no consequences laughing at court drama not having to do anything really. Then he got tossed into this responsibility when No ONE around him prepared him for it (especially when the greens were preparing the usurpation since Aegon was 2 yo),2024-07-14 20:39:12 GMT
