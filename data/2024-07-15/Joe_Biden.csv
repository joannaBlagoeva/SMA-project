3,Joe Biden,['kamala harris'  'democratic party'  'usa elections'  'vote blue'  'vote democrat'],laurentiuvladut,So. There is some chaos and discussion on what the democratic party in the USA should do. Keep Biden or replace him with someone else(most likely Kamala Harris).  This is actually complicated for several reasons. Sure Kamala is younger and in a better mental and physical shape and according to some polls she does better against Trump. But on the other hand according to most polls she does worse then Biden the GOP has started their racist and sexist attacks against her she lack the traditional incumbent advantage(incumbents tend to do better then they are polled to do) and a large part of the centrists and the goldfish swing voters have forgotten how bad things were under Trump.  But whatever the Democratic Party choses to do‚Ä¶.please. Just fucking vote blue. If anybody from the USA sees this vote blue and save your country from fascism. Just‚Ä¶do this.,2024-07-07 20:57:22 GMT
17,Joe Biden,['rebecca solnit'  'election 2024'],dreaminginthedeepsouth,Why is the pundit class so desperate to push Biden out of the race? | Rebecca Solnit  Iam not usually one to offer diagnoses of people I‚Äôve never met but it does seem like the pundit class of the American media is suffering from severe memory loss. Because they‚Äôre doing exactly what they did in the 2016 presidential race ‚Äì providing wildly asymmetrical and inflammatory coverage of the one candidate running against Donald J Trump.  They have become a stampeding herd producing an avalanche of stories suggesting Biden is unfit will lose and should go away at a point in the campaign in which replacing him would likely be somewhere between extremely difficult and utterly catastrophic. They do this while ignoring something every scholar and critic of journalism knows well and every journalist should. As Nikole Hannah-Jones put it: ‚ÄúAs media we consistently proclaim that we are just reporting the news when in fact we are driving it. What we cover how we cover it determines often what Americans think is important and how they perceive these issues yet we keep pretending it‚Äôs not so.‚Äù They are not reporting that he is a loser; they are making him one.  According to one journalist‚Äôs tally the New York Times has run 192 stories on the subject since the debate including 50 editorials and 142 news stories. The Washington Post which has also gone for saturation coverage published a resignation speech they wrote for him. Not to be outdone the New Yorker‚Äôs editor-in-chief declared that Biden not going away ‚Äúwould be an act not only of self-delusion but of national endangerment‚Äù and had a staff writer suggest that Democrats should use the never-before-deployed 25th amendment.  Since this would have to be led by Vice-President Kamala Harris it would be a sort of insider coup. And so it goes with what appears to be a journalistic competition to outdo each other in the aggressiveness of the attacks and the unreality of the proposals. It‚Äôs a dogpile and a panic and there is no one more unable to understand their own emotional life biases and motives than people who are utterly convinced of their own ironclad rationality and objectivity AKA most of these pundits.  Speaking of coups we‚Äôve had a couple of late which perhaps merit attention as we consider who is unfit to hold office. This time around Trump is not just a celebrity with a lot of sexual assault allegations bankruptcies and loopily malicious statements as he was in 2016. He‚Äôs a convicted criminal who orchestrated a coup attempt to steal an election both through backroom corruption and public lies and through a violent attack on Congress. The extremist US supreme court justices he selected during his last presidential term themselves staged a coup this very Monday overthrowing the US constitution itself and the principle that no one is above the law to make presidents into kings just after legalizing bribery of officials and dismantling the regulatory state by throwing out the Chevron deference.  Trump‚Äôs own former staffers are part of the Heritage Foundation‚Äôs team planning to implement Project 25 if he wins which would finish off our system of government with yet another coup. ‚ÄúWe are in the process of the second American revolution which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be‚Äù said the foundation‚Äôs president the other day. This alarms me. So does the behavior of the US mainstream media which seems more concerned with sabotaging the only thing standing between us and this third coup.  ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt we talking about Trump‚Äôs fascism?‚Äù demands the headline of Jeet Heer‚Äôs piece in the Nation to which the answer might be a piece by the Nation‚Äôs own editor-in-chief titled ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs patriotic duty‚Äù that proposes his duty is to get lost. Sometimes I wonder if all this coverage is because the media knows how to cover a normal problem like a sub-par candidate; they don‚Äôt know how to cover something as abnormal and unprecedented as the end of the republic. So for the most part they don‚Äôt.  Biden is old. He was one kind of appalling in the 27 June debate listless and sometimes stumbling and muddling his words. But Trump was another kind of appalling in that almost everything he said was an outrageous lie and some of it was a threat. I get that writing about the monstrosity that is Trump faces the problem that it‚Äôs not news; he‚Äôs been a monster spouting lurid nonsense all his life (but his political crimes are recent and his free-associating public soliloquies on sharks batteries toilets water flow and Hannibal Lector among other topics are genuinely demented). He‚Äôs a racist a fascist and a rapist (according to a civil-court verdict).  We are deciding whether this nation has a future as a more-or-less democratic republic this November and on that rides the fate of the earth when it comes to acting on climate change. If the US falters at this decisive moment in the climate crisis it will drag down everyone else‚Äôs efforts. Under Trump it will. But the shocking supreme court decisions this summer and the looming threat of authoritarianism have gotten little ink and air compared to the hue and cry about Biden‚Äôs competence.  Few seem to remember that Biden‚Äôs age and his verbal gaffes were an issue in the 2020 campaign. Biden is a lifelong stutterer and the effort to keep his words on track means that he operates under an extra burden with every unscripted answer he gives particularly under pressure (though he had a long easygoing conversation with Howard Stern a couple of months ago in which he discusses his stuttering at about the 1:13 mark).  Some speech pathologists have suggested he may (not does just may) have a disorder that sometimes accompanies stuttering called cluttering which is not an intellectual deficiency but a sometimes hectic and disorderly translation of thoughts into words. In recent months actual gerontologists have said in print that Biden appears to have normal signs of aging not signs of dementia. Nevertheless the amateur armchair diagnosticians have been out in packs and their confidence in their ability to diagnose from watching TV is itself an alarming delusion. I am not giving Biden a clean bill of health; I‚Äôm saying that I don‚Äôt have a basis to render a verdict (and neither do the august editors of large publications).  Few seem to remember that Biden‚Äôs age and his verbal gaffes were an issue in the 2020 campaign  Although the Biden administration seems to have run extremely well for three and a half years with a strong cabinet few scandals and little turnover a thriving economy and some major legislative accomplishments the narrative the punditocracy has created suggest we should ignore this record and decide on the basis of the 90-minute debate and reference to newly surfaced swarms of anonymous sources that Biden is incompetent. Quite a lot of them have been running magical-realism fantasy-football scenarios in which it is fun and easy to swap in your favorite substitute candidate. The reality is that it is hard and quite likely to be a terrible mess. Nevertheless this pretense is supposed to mean that telling a presidential candidate in mid-campaign to get lost is fine.  The main argument against Biden is not that he can‚Äôt govern ‚Äì that would be hard to make given that he seems to have done so for the past years ‚Äì but that he can‚Äôt win the election. But candidates do not win elections by themselves. Elections are won to state the obvious by how the electorate turns out and votes. The electorate votes based on how they understand the situation and evaluate the candidates. That is of course in large part shaped by the media as Hannah-Jones points out and the media is right now campaigning hard for a Democratic party loss. The other term for that is a Republican victory. Few things have terrified and horrified me the way this does.  Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Dr. Kevin Cannard a Parkinson‚Äôs disease expert at Walter Reed Medical Center met with Dr. Kevin O‚ÄôConnor and two others at the White House residence clinic on Jan. 17 according to the records which emerge as questions continue to swirl about the 81-year-old president‚Äôs mental health in the wake of his debate debacle last week with former President Trump.  Dr. John E. Atwood a cardiologist at Walter Reed was also in the 5 P.M. meeting the White House visitor logs show.  Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS) who is a physician said ‚Äúmany‚Äù in the medical community have ‚Äúsuspected for several years that the president might be suffering from Parkinson‚Äôs disease.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSadly over 500000 Americans are afflicted by this progressive neurological condition. If the president of the United States is among them the American people deserve to know before voting in November‚Äù he told The Post.  Dr. Rob Howard a professor of old age psychiatry at University College London said that President Biden displayed many symptoms indicative of Parkinson‚Äôs disease.  The president‚Äôs ‚Äúfluctuation in attentional function his facial appearance and his gait‚Äù were all signs that something is amiss said Howard who has never examined Biden and added he was not offering a formal diagnosis.  ‚ÄúI am not saying its Parkinson‚Äôs disease I am just pointing out that there are features to him that are consistent with Parkinson‚Äôs disease.‚Äù  Cannard is an authority on Parkinson‚Äôs who has worked at Walter Reed for nearly 20 years.  Since 2012 he has served as the ‚Äúneurology specialist supporting the White House Medical Unit‚Äù according to his LinkedIn.  His most recent paper was published in August 2023 in the journal Parkinsonism &amp; Related Disorders and focuses on the ‚Äúearly-stage‚Äù of the crippling disease.  Tragic that this Kevin O&#x27;Connor would risk his medical license to coverup for the Biden family and jeopardize our national security.,2024-07-07 18:46:36 GMT

According to one journalist‚Äôs tally the New York Times has run 192 stories on the subject since the debate including 50 editorials and 142 news stories. The Washington Post which has also gone for saturation coverage published a resignation speech they wrote for him. Not to be outdone the New Yorker‚Äôs editor-in-chief declared that Biden not going away ‚Äúwould be an act not only of self-delusion but of national endangerment‚Äù and had a staff writer suggest that Democrats should use the never-before-deployed 25th amendment.  Since this would have to be led by Vice-President Kamala Harris it would be a sort of insider coup. And so it goes with what appears to be a journalistic competition to outdo each other in the aggressiveness of the attacks and the unreality of the proposals. It‚Äôs a dogpile and a panic and there is no one more unable to understand their own emotional life biases and motives than people who are utterly convinced of their own ironclad rationality and objectivity AKA most of these pundits.  Speaking of coups we‚Äôve had a couple of late which perhaps merit attention as we consider who is unfit to hold office. This time around Trump is not just a celebrity with a lot of sexual assault allegations bankruptcies and loopily malicious statements as he was in 2016. He‚Äôs a convicted criminal who orchestrated a coup attempt to steal an election both through backroom corruption and public lies and through a violent attack on Congress. The extremist US supreme court justices he selected during his last presidential term themselves staged a coup this very Monday overthrowing the US constitution itself and the principle that no one is above the law to make presidents into kings just after legalizing bribery of officials and dismantling the regulatory state by throwing out the Chevron deference.  Trump‚Äôs own former staffers are part of the Heritage Foundation‚Äôs team planning to implement Project 25 if he wins which would finish off our system of government with yet another coup. ‚ÄúWe are in the process of the second American revolution which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be‚Äù said the foundation‚Äôs president the other day. This alarms me. So does the behavior of the US mainstream media which seems more concerned with sabotaging the only thing standing between us and this third coup.  ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt we talking about Trump‚Äôs fascism?‚Äù demands the headline of Jeet Heer‚Äôs piece in the Nation to which the answer might be a piece by the Nation‚Äôs own editor-in-chief titled ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs patriotic duty‚Äù that proposes his duty is to get lost. Sometimes I wonder if all this coverage is because the media knows how to cover a normal problem like a sub-par candidate; they don‚Äôt know how to cover something as abnormal and unprecedented as the end of the republic. So for the most part they don‚Äôt.  Biden is old. He was one kind of appalling in the 27 June debate listless and sometimes stumbling and muddling his words. But Trump was another kind of appalling in that almost everything he said was an outrageous lie and some of it was a threat. I get that writing about the monstrosity that is Trump faces the problem that it‚Äôs not news; he‚Äôs been a monster spouting lurid nonsense all his life (but his political crimes are recent and his free-associating public soliloquies on sharks batteries toilets water flow and Hannibal Lector among other topics are genuinely demented). He‚Äôs a racist a fascist and a rapist (according to a civil-court verdict).  We are deciding whether this nation has a future as a more-or-less democratic republic this November and on that rides the fate of the earth when it comes to acting on climate change. If the US falters at this decisive moment in the climate crisis it will drag down everyone else‚Äôs efforts. Under Trump it will. But the shocking supreme court decisions this summer and the looming threat of authoritarianism have gotten little ink and air compared to the hue and cry about Biden‚Äôs competence.  Few seem to remember that Biden‚Äôs age and his verbal gaffes were an issue in the 2020 campaign. Biden is a lifelong stutterer and the effort to keep his words on track means that he operates under an extra burden with every unscripted answer he gives particularly under pressure (though he had a long easygoing conversation with Howard Stern a couple of months ago in which he discusses his stuttering at about the 1:13 mark).  Some speech pathologists have suggested he may (not does just may) have a disorder that sometimes accompanies stuttering called cluttering which is not an intellectual deficiency but a sometimes hectic and disorderly translation of thoughts into words. In recent months actual gerontologists have said in print that Biden appears to have normal signs of aging not signs of dementia. Nevertheless the amateur armchair diagnosticians have been out in packs and their confidence in their ability to diagnose from watching TV is itself an alarming delusion. I am not giving Biden a clean bill of health; I‚Äôm saying that I don‚Äôt have a basis to render a verdict (and neither do the august editors of large publications).  Few seem to remember that Biden‚Äôs age and his verbal gaffes were an issue in the 2020 campaign  Although the Biden administration seems to have run extremely well for three and a half years with a strong cabinet few scandals and little turnover a thriving economy and some major legislative accomplishments the narrative the punditocracy has created suggest we should ignore this record and decide on the basis of the 90-minute debate and reference to newly surfaced swarms of anonymous sources that Biden is incompetent. Quite a lot of them have been running magical-realism fantasy-football scenarios in which it is fun and easy to swap in your favorite substitute candidate. The reality is that it is hard and quite likely to be a terrible mess. Nevertheless this pretense is supposed to mean that telling a presidential candidate in mid-campaign to get lost is fine.  The main argument against Biden is not that he can‚Äôt govern ‚Äì that would be hard to make given that he seems to have done so for the past years ‚Äì but that he can‚Äôt win the election. But candidates do not win elections by themselves. Elections are won to state the obvious by how the electorate turns out and votes. The electorate votes based on how they understand the situation and evaluate the candidates. That is of course in large part shaped by the media as Hannah-Jones points out and the media is right now campaigning hard for a Democratic party loss. The other term for that is a Republican victory. Few things have terrified and horrified me the way this does.  Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

But Trump was another kind of appalling in that almost everything he said was an outrageous lie and some of it was a threat. I get that writing about the monstrosity that is Trump faces the problem that it‚Äôs not news; he‚Äôs been a monster spouting lurid nonsense all his life (but his political crimes are recent and his free-associating public soliloquies on sharks batteries toilets water flow and Hannibal Lector among other topics are genuinely demented). He‚Äôs a racist a fascist and a rapist (according to a civil-court verdict).  We are deciding whether this nation has a future as a more-or-less democratic republic this November and on that rides the fate of the earth when it comes to acting on climate change. If the US falters at this decisive moment in the climate crisis it will drag down everyone else‚Äôs efforts. Under Trump it will. But the shocking supreme court decisions this summer and the looming threat of authoritarianism have gotten little ink and air compared to the hue and cry about Biden‚Äôs competence.  Few seem to remember that Biden‚Äôs age and his verbal gaffes were an issue in the 2020 campaign. Biden is a lifelong stutterer and the effort to keep his words on track means that he operates under an extra burden with every unscripted answer he gives particularly under pressure (though he had a long easygoing conversation with Howard Stern a couple of months ago in which he discusses his stuttering at about the 1:13 mark).  Some speech pathologists have suggested he may (not does just may) have a disorder that sometimes accompanies stuttering called cluttering which is not an intellectual deficiency but a sometimes hectic and disorderly translation of thoughts into words. In recent months actual gerontologists have said in print that Biden appears to have normal signs of aging not signs of dementia. Nevertheless the amateur armchair diagnosticians have been out in packs and their confidence in their ability to diagnose from watching TV is itself an alarming delusion. I am not giving Biden a clean bill of health; I‚Äôm saying that I don‚Äôt have a basis to render a verdict (and neither do the august editors of large publications).  Few seem to remember that Biden‚Äôs age and his verbal gaffes were an issue in the 2020 campaign  Although the Biden administration seems to have run extremely well for three and a half years with a strong cabinet few scandals and little turnover a thriving economy and some major legislative accomplishments the narrative the punditocracy has created suggest we should ignore this record and decide on the basis of the 90-minute debate and reference to newly surfaced swarms of anonymous sources that Biden is incompetent. Quite a lot of them have been running magical-realism fantasy-football scenarios in which it is fun and easy to swap in your favorite substitute candidate. The reality is that it is hard and quite likely to be a terrible mess. Nevertheless this pretense is supposed to mean that telling a presidential candidate in mid-campaign to get lost is fine.  The main argument against Biden is not that he can‚Äôt govern ‚Äì that would be hard to make given that he seems to have done so for the past years ‚Äì but that he can‚Äôt win the election. But candidates do not win elections by themselves. Elections are won to state the obvious by how the electorate turns out and votes. The electorate votes based on how they understand the situation and evaluate the candidates. That is of course in large part shaped by the media as Hannah-Jones points out and the media is right now campaigning hard for a Democratic party loss. The other term for that is a Republican victory. Few things have terrified and horrified me the way this does.  Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

There is some chaos and discussion on what the democratic party in the USA should do. Keep Biden or replace him with someone else(most likely Kamala Harris).  This is actually complicated for several reasons. Sure Kamala is younger and in a better mental and physical shape and according to some polls she does better against Trump. But on the other hand according to most polls she does worse then Biden the GOP has started their racist and sexist attacks against her she lack the traditional incumbent advantage(incumbents tend to do better then they are polled to do) and a large part of the centrists and the goldfish swing voters have forgotten how bad things were under Trump.  But whatever the Democratic Party choses to do‚Ä¶.please. Just fucking vote blue. If anybody from the USA sees this vote blue and save your country from fascism.

17,Joe Biden,['rebecca solnit'  'election 2024'],dreaminginthedeepsouth,Why is the pundit class so desperate to push Biden out of the race? | Rebecca Solnit  Iam not usually one to offer diagnoses of people I‚Äôve never met but it does seem like the pundit class of the American media is suffering from severe memory loss. Because they‚Äôre doing exactly what they did in the 2016 presidential race ‚Äì providing wildly asymmetrical and inflammatory coverage of the one candidate running against Donald J Trump.  They have become a stampeding herd producing an avalanche of stories suggesting Biden is unfit will lose and should go away at a point in the campaign in which replacing him would likely be somewhere between extremely difficult and utterly catastrophic. They do this while ignoring something every scholar and critic of journalism knows well and every journalist should. As Nikole Hannah-Jones put it: ‚ÄúAs media we consistently proclaim that we are just reporting the news when in fact we are driving it. What we cover how we cover it determines often what Americans think is important and how they perceive these issues yet we keep pretending it‚Äôs not so.‚Äù They are not reporting that he is a loser; they are making him one.  According to one journalist‚Äôs tally the New York Times has run 192 stories on the subject since the debate including 50 editorials and 142 news stories. The Washington Post which has also gone for saturation coverage published a resignation speech they wrote for him. Not to be outdone the New Yorker‚Äôs editor-in-chief declared that Biden not going away ‚Äúwould be an act not only of self-delusion but of national endangerment‚Äù and had a staff writer suggest that Democrats should use the never-before-deployed 25th amendment.  Since this would have to be led by Vice-President Kamala Harris it would be a sort of insider coup. And so it goes with what appears to be a journalistic competition to outdo each other in the aggressiveness of the attacks and the unreality of the proposals. It‚Äôs a dogpile and a panic and there is no one more unable to understand their own emotional life biases and motives than people who are utterly convinced of their own ironclad rationality and objectivity AKA most of these pundits.  Speaking of coups we‚Äôve had a couple of late which perhaps merit attention as we consider who is unfit to hold office. This time around Trump is not just a celebrity with a lot of sexual assault allegations bankruptcies and loopily malicious statements as he was in 2016. He‚Äôs a convicted criminal who orchestrated a coup attempt to steal an election both through backroom corruption and public lies and through a violent attack on Congress. The extremist US supreme court justices he selected during his last presidential term themselves staged a coup this very Monday overthrowing the US constitution itself and the principle that no one is above the law to make presidents into kings just after legalizing bribery of officials and dismantling the regulatory state by throwing out the Chevron deference.  Trump‚Äôs own former staffers are part of the Heritage Foundation‚Äôs team planning to implement Project 25 if he wins which would finish off our system of government with yet another coup. ‚ÄúWe are in the process of the second American revolution which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be‚Äù said the foundation‚Äôs president the other day. This alarms me. So does the behavior of the US mainstream media which seems more concerned with sabotaging the only thing standing between us and this third coup.  ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt we talking about Trump‚Äôs fascism?‚Äù demands the headline of Jeet Heer‚Äôs piece in the Nation to which the answer might be a piece by the Nation‚Äôs own editor-in-chief titled ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs patriotic duty‚Äù that proposes his duty is to get lost. Sometimes I wonder if all this coverage is because the media knows how to cover a normal problem like a sub-par candidate; they don‚Äôt know how to cover something as abnormal and unprecedented as the end of the republic. So for the most part they don‚Äôt.  Biden is old. He was one kind of appalling in the 27 June debate listless and sometimes stumbling and muddling his words.

I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs true. The stakes of this election are as high as they‚Äôve ever been.   That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm running for president.   If you‚Äôve heard about Project 2025 then you are still in the minority of American voters. The media is only beginning to wake up to what they‚Äôve called the blueprint for American fascism.   And there is plenty in this plan that is alarming. The ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù include:   A mass purge of dedicated civil servants from every federal agency to be replaced by unqualified lackeys chosen for their loyalty to the Republican president.   A deportation regime targeting millions of undocumented Americans and rounding them up into concentration camps to stage them for removal from the country.   Putting a target squarely on the 2SLGBTQIA+ community by declaring all media and materials that even mention LGBTQ identities as ‚Äúpornography‚Äù and placing anyone who publishes LGBTQ+ friendly-materials onto a government watchlist.   Formally weaponizing federal law enforcement agencies to answer to the whims of the president and even nationalizing local police forces.   This is just a taste of what this 900-page plan entails. But here‚Äôs what they haven‚Äôt told you‚Ä¶   This has been the Republican agenda for more than 40 years.   Project 2025 is the latest iteration of the Heritage Foundation‚Äôs ‚ÄúMandate for Leadership‚Äù drafted for Ronald Reagan in his first administration. Since then it has repeatedly evolved to incorporate new and terrible plans to expand the powers of the presidency enrich the billionaire class forcibly install Christian Nationalism as a governing doctrine and convert our pluralistic democracy into the white supremacist police state they‚Äôve always dreamed of.   The real danger of Project 2025 is that with a successful complete right-wing takeover of our courts Republicans now have all the tools they need to make it a reality ‚Äì and Democrats have done nothing to stop them.   We saw this with last week‚Äôs Supreme Court decision declaring that presidents are officially above the law. And how did Joe Biden respond to this a death blow to our constitution?   He said ‚ÄúI dissent‚Äù and tepidly promised to never abuse his new powers.   Joe Biden is right about one thing ‚Äì democracy IS on the ballot this year.   But he‚Äôs wrong about this: Democrats cannot and will not save us.   We have to get real about the threats we‚Äôre facing.   This election will decide the future of our planet and the survival of our species as we confront an ever-accelerating climate emergency.   This election will decide whether or not women will remain second class citizens without full autonomy over our bodies and our lives.   This election will decide if our 2SLGBTQIA+ siblings will see all of their hard-won rights stripped away in the face of escalating harassment abuse and violence.   This election will decide if we continue to fund and facilitate the extermination of an entire people in Palestine and whether we allow that barbarity to expand into a regional war that pulls in our own troops and makes us even more complicit in Israel‚Äôs war crimes.   This election will decide a lot of things not the least of which is whether or not we continue to exist as the UNITED states of America.   With so much on the line we have to be honest about our options.   Republicans have proudly broadcast their plans for more than 40 years. Democrats have done NOTHING to meaningfully stay the right wing‚Äôs fascist ambitions ‚Äì and in more ways than I can begin to enumerate Democrats have actively advanced those ambitions.   As Biden‚Äôs approval ratings and electoral chances continue to plummet THIS is what Kevin Robertson president of the Heritage Foundation and principal architect of Project 2025 has to say about their plans:   ‚ÄúWe are in the process of the second American Revolution which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.‚Äù   That is a threat and it must be treated as such.   Joe Biden cannot and will not meet this moment but I will.  Ours is the ONLY pro-worker pro-planet pro-peace anti-genocide campaign that will be on the ballot everywhere this November. After that disastrous debate millions of American voters are re-examining their options ‚Äì and they need to hear from us.   In his recent interview with George Stephanopoulos Biden was asked how he would feel if despite all the warnings and the hundreds of millions of dollars Democrats are raising Trump actually wins and all of this comes to pass.   Biden‚Äôs answer was: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did as good a job as I know I can do that‚Äôs what this is about.‚Äù   That‚Äôs his answer to the threat of American fascism and the collapse of American leadership on the world stage: ‚ÄúAt least I did my best.‚Äù   It reveals a cold hard truth about the president and every member of our political elite: if Trump is re-elected they will be fine.   They‚Äôll go back to fundraising for the next election. They‚Äôll run to K-Street and cash in as lobbyists. Or they‚Äôll retire to Martha‚Äôs Vineyard.   The elites will survive a second Trump presidency without a hitch. It is always the most vulnerable who pay the price for repeated Democratic failures and betrayals.   I need your financial support to get our campaign out to every voter looking for a president who will actually fight for our democracy as if lives are on the line ‚Äì because they are.

I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs true. The stakes of this election are as high as they‚Äôve ever been.   That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm running for president.   If you‚Äôve heard about Project 2025 then you are still in the minority of American voters. The media is only beginning to wake up to what they‚Äôve called the blueprint for American fascism.   And there is plenty in this plan that is alarming. The ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù include:   A mass purge of dedicated civil servants from every federal agency to be replaced by unqualified lackeys chosen for their loyalty to the Republican president.   A deportation regime targeting millions of undocumented Americans and rounding them up into concentration camps to stage them for removal from the country.   Putting a target squarely on the 2SLGBTQIA+ community by declaring all media and materials that even mention LGBTQ identities as ‚Äúpornography‚Äù and placing anyone who publishes LGBTQ+ friendly-materials onto a government watchlist.   Formally weaponizing federal law enforcement agencies to answer to the whims of the president and even nationalizing local police forces.   This is just a taste of what this 900-page plan entails. But here‚Äôs what they haven‚Äôt told you‚Ä¶   This has been the Republican agenda for more than 40 years.   Project 2025 is the latest iteration of the Heritage Foundation‚Äôs ‚ÄúMandate for Leadership‚Äù drafted for Ronald Reagan in his first administration. Since then it has repeatedly evolved to incorporate new and terrible plans to expand the powers of the presidency enrich the billionaire class forcibly install Christian Nationalism as a governing doctrine and convert our pluralistic democracy into the white supremacist police state they‚Äôve always dreamed of.   The real danger of Project 2025 is that with a successful complete right-wing takeover of our courts Republicans now have all the tools they need to make it a reality ‚Äì and Democrats have done nothing to stop them.   We saw this with last week‚Äôs Supreme Court decision declaring that presidents are officially above the law. And how did Joe Biden respond to this a death blow to our constitution?   He said ‚ÄúI dissent‚Äù and tepidly promised to never abuse his new powers.   Joe Biden is right about one thing ‚Äì democracy IS on the ballot this year.   But he‚Äôs wrong about this: Democrats cannot and will not save us.   We have to get real about the threats we‚Äôre facing.   This election will decide the future of our planet and the survival of our species as we confront an ever-accelerating climate emergency.   This election will decide whether or not women will remain second class citizens without full autonomy over our bodies and our lives.   This election will decide if our 2SLGBTQIA+ siblings will see all of their hard-won rights stripped away in the face of escalating harassment abuse and violence.   This election will decide if we continue to fund and facilitate the extermination of an entire people in Palestine and whether we allow that barbarity to expand into a regional war that pulls in our own troops and makes us even more complicit in Israel‚Äôs war crimes.   This election will decide a lot of things not the least of which is whether or not we continue to exist as the UNITED states of America.   With so much on the line we have to be honest about our options.   Republicans have proudly broadcast their plans for more than 40 years. Democrats have done NOTHING to meaningfully stay the right wing‚Äôs fascist ambitions ‚Äì and in more ways than I can begin to enumerate Democrats have actively advanced those ambitions.   As Biden‚Äôs approval ratings and electoral chances continue to plummet THIS is what Kevin Robertson president of the Heritage Foundation and principal architect of Project 2025 has to say about their plans:   ‚ÄúWe are in the process of the second American Revolution which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.‚Äù   That is a threat and it must be treated as such.   Joe Biden cannot and will not meet this moment but I will.  Ours is the ONLY pro-worker pro-planet pro-peace anti-genocide campaign that will be on the ballot everywhere this November. After that disastrous debate millions of American voters are re-examining their options ‚Äì and they need to hear from us.   In his recent interview with George Stephanopoulos Biden was asked how he would feel if despite all the warnings and the hundreds of millions of dollars Democrats are raising Trump actually wins and all of this comes to pass.   Biden‚Äôs answer was: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did as good a job as I know I can do that‚Äôs what this is about.‚Äù   That‚Äôs his answer to the threat of American fascism and the collapse of American leadership on the world stage: ‚ÄúAt least I did my best.‚Äù   It reveals a cold hard truth about the president and every member of our political elite: if Trump is re-elected they will be fine.   They‚Äôll go back to fundraising for the next election. They‚Äôll run to K-Street and cash in as lobbyists. Or they‚Äôll retire to Martha‚Äôs Vineyard.   The elites will survive a second Trump presidency without a hitch. It is always the most vulnerable who pay the price for repeated Democratic failures and betrayals.   I need your financial support to get our campaign out to every voter looking for a president who will actually fight for our democracy as if lives are on the line ‚Äì because they are.

I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs true. The stakes of this election are as high as they‚Äôve ever been.   That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm running for president.   If you‚Äôve heard about Project 2025 then you are still in the minority of American voters. The media is only beginning to wake up to what they‚Äôve called the blueprint for American fascism.   And there is plenty in this plan that is alarming. The ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù include:   A mass purge of dedicated civil servants from every federal agency to be replaced by unqualified lackeys chosen for their loyalty to the Republican president.   A deportation regime targeting millions of undocumented Americans and rounding them up into concentration camps to stage them for removal from the country.   Putting a target squarely on the 2SLGBTQIA+ community by declaring all media and materials that even mention LGBTQ identities as ‚Äúpornography‚Äù and placing anyone who publishes LGBTQ+ friendly-materials onto a government watchlist.   Formally weaponizing federal law enforcement agencies to answer to the whims of the president and even nationalizing local police forces.   This is just a taste of what this 900-page plan entails. But here‚Äôs what they haven‚Äôt told you‚Ä¶   This has been the Republican agenda for more than 40 years.   Project 2025 is the latest iteration of the Heritage Foundation‚Äôs ‚ÄúMandate for Leadership‚Äù drafted for Ronald Reagan in his first administration. Since then it has repeatedly evolved to incorporate new and terrible plans to expand the powers of the presidency enrich the billionaire class forcibly install Christian Nationalism as a governing doctrine and convert our pluralistic democracy into the white supremacist police state they‚Äôve always dreamed of.   The real danger of Project 2025 is that with a successful complete right-wing takeover of our courts Republicans now have all the tools they need to make it a reality ‚Äì and Democrats have done nothing to stop them.   We saw this with last week‚Äôs Supreme Court decision declaring that presidents are officially above the law. And how did Joe Biden respond to this a death blow to our constitution?   He said ‚ÄúI dissent‚Äù and tepidly promised to never abuse his new powers.   Joe Biden is right about one thing ‚Äì democracy IS on the ballot this year.   But he‚Äôs wrong about this: Democrats cannot and will not save us.   We have to get real about the threats we‚Äôre facing.   This election will decide the future of our planet and the survival of our species as we confront an ever-accelerating climate emergency.   This election will decide whether or not women will remain second class citizens without full autonomy over our bodies and our lives.   This election will decide if our 2SLGBTQIA+ siblings will see all of their hard-won rights stripped away in the face of escalating harassment abuse and violence.   This election will decide if we continue to fund and facilitate the extermination of an entire people in Palestine and whether we allow that barbarity to expand into a regional war that pulls in our own troops and makes us even more complicit in Israel‚Äôs war crimes.   This election will decide a lot of things not the least of which is whether or not we continue to exist as the UNITED states of America.   With so much on the line we have to be honest about our options.   Republicans have proudly broadcast their plans for more than 40 years. Democrats have done NOTHING to meaningfully stay the right wing‚Äôs fascist ambitions ‚Äì and in more ways than I can begin to enumerate Democrats have actively advanced those ambitions.   As Biden‚Äôs approval ratings and electoral chances continue to plummet THIS is what Kevin Robertson president of the Heritage Foundation and principal architect of Project 2025 has to say about their plans:   ‚ÄúWe are in the process of the second American Revolution which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.‚Äù   That is a threat and it must be treated as such.   Joe Biden cannot and will not meet this moment but I will.  Ours is the ONLY pro-worker pro-planet pro-peace anti-genocide campaign that will be on the ballot everywhere this November. After that disastrous debate millions of American voters are re-examining their options ‚Äì and they need to hear from us.   In his recent interview with George Stephanopoulos Biden was asked how he would feel if despite all the warnings and the hundreds of millions of dollars Democrats are raising Trump actually wins and all of this comes to pass.   Biden‚Äôs answer was: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did as good a job as I know I can do that‚Äôs what this is about.‚Äù   That‚Äôs his answer to the threat of American fascism and the collapse of American leadership on the world stage: ‚ÄúAt least I did my best.‚Äù   It reveals a cold hard truth about the president and every member of our political elite: if Trump is re-elected they will be fine.   They‚Äôll go back to fundraising for the next election. They‚Äôll run to K-Street and cash in as lobbyists. Or they‚Äôll retire to Martha‚Äôs Vineyard.   The elites will survive a second Trump presidency without a hitch. It is always the most vulnerable who pay the price for repeated Democratic failures and betrayals.   I need your financial support to get our campaign out to every voter looking for a president who will actually fight for our democracy as if lives are on the line ‚Äì because they are.

I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs true. The stakes of this election are as high as they‚Äôve ever been.   That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm running for president.   If you‚Äôve heard about Project 2025 then you are still in the minority of American voters. The media is only beginning to wake up to what they‚Äôve called the blueprint for American fascism.   And there is plenty in this plan that is alarming. The ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù include:   A mass purge of dedicated civil servants from every federal agency to be replaced by unqualified lackeys chosen for their loyalty to the Republican president.   A deportation regime targeting millions of undocumented Americans and rounding them up into concentration camps to stage them for removal from the country.   Putting a target squarely on the 2SLGBTQIA+ community by declaring all media and materials that even mention LGBTQ identities as ‚Äúpornography‚Äù and placing anyone who publishes LGBTQ+ friendly-materials onto a government watchlist.   Formally weaponizing federal law enforcement agencies to answer to the whims of the president and even nationalizing local police forces.   This is just a taste of what this 900-page plan entails. But here‚Äôs what they haven‚Äôt told you‚Ä¶   This has been the Republican agenda for more than 40 years.   Project 2025 is the latest iteration of the Heritage Foundation‚Äôs ‚ÄúMandate for Leadership‚Äù drafted for Ronald Reagan in his first administration. Since then it has repeatedly evolved to incorporate new and terrible plans to expand the powers of the presidency enrich the billionaire class forcibly install Christian Nationalism as a governing doctrine and convert our pluralistic democracy into the white supremacist police state they‚Äôve always dreamed of.   The real danger of Project 2025 is that with a successful complete right-wing takeover of our courts Republicans now have all the tools they need to make it a reality ‚Äì and Democrats have done nothing to stop them.   We saw this with last week‚Äôs Supreme Court decision declaring that presidents are officially above the law. And how did Joe Biden respond to this a death blow to our constitution?   He said ‚ÄúI dissent‚Äù and tepidly promised to never abuse his new powers.   Joe Biden is right about one thing ‚Äì democracy IS on the ballot this year.   But he‚Äôs wrong about this: Democrats cannot and will not save us.   We have to get real about the threats we‚Äôre facing.   This election will decide the future of our planet and the survival of our species as we confront an ever-accelerating climate emergency.   This election will decide whether or not women will remain second class citizens without full autonomy over our bodies and our lives.   This election will decide if our 2SLGBTQIA+ siblings will see all of their hard-won rights stripped away in the face of escalating harassment abuse and violence.   This election will decide if we continue to fund and facilitate the extermination of an entire people in Palestine and whether we allow that barbarity to expand into a regional war that pulls in our own troops and makes us even more complicit in Israel‚Äôs war crimes.   This election will decide a lot of things not the least of which is whether or not we continue to exist as the UNITED states of America.   With so much on the line we have to be honest about our options.   Republicans have proudly broadcast their plans for more than 40 years. Democrats have done NOTHING to meaningfully stay the right wing‚Äôs fascist ambitions ‚Äì and in more ways than I can begin to enumerate Democrats have actively advanced those ambitions.   As Biden‚Äôs approval ratings and electoral chances continue to plummet THIS is what Kevin Robertson president of the Heritage Foundation and principal architect of Project 2025 has to say about their plans:   ‚ÄúWe are in the process of the second American Revolution which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.‚Äù   That is a threat and it must be treated as such.   Joe Biden cannot and will not meet this moment but I will.  Ours is the ONLY pro-worker pro-planet pro-peace anti-genocide campaign that will be on the ballot everywhere this November. After that disastrous debate millions of American voters are re-examining their options ‚Äì and they need to hear from us.   In his recent interview with George Stephanopoulos Biden was asked how he would feel if despite all the warnings and the hundreds of millions of dollars Democrats are raising Trump actually wins and all of this comes to pass.   Biden‚Äôs answer was: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did as good a job as I know I can do that‚Äôs what this is about.‚Äù   That‚Äôs his answer to the threat of American fascism and the collapse of American leadership on the world stage: ‚ÄúAt least I did my best.‚Äù   It reveals a cold hard truth about the president and every member of our political elite: if Trump is re-elected they will be fine.   They‚Äôll go back to fundraising for the next election. They‚Äôll run to K-Street and cash in as lobbyists. Or they‚Äôll retire to Martha‚Äôs Vineyard.   The elites will survive a second Trump presidency without a hitch. It is always the most vulnerable who pay the price for repeated Democratic failures and betrayals.   I need your financial support to get our campaign out to every voter looking for a president who will actually fight for our democracy as if lives are on the line ‚Äì because they are.

Who during his three and a half years as President of the United States of America reduced costs on prescriptions for countless numbers of Americans. Secured a bill for an inflation reduction act and an infrastructure bill to help rebuild America.  Vs.  78 year old Donald Trump. A man whose charity was shutdown as a fraud. Had his fake university shut down as a fraud. Had one of his businesses convicted on multiple felony fraud counts. His CFO is sitting in prison. One of his personal lawyers went to prison. A second has lost his law license. Trump has been charged under the espionage act with highly classified documents including multiple sources reporting nuclear secrets. Trump was found liable by jury for sexual assault. Trump was charged with more than a dozen felonies under a RICO indictment in the state of Georgia. And finally Trump was found guilty by a jury for 30 plus felonies and now is awaiting a possible prison sentence.,2024-07-08 02:13:10 GMT

I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs true. The stakes of this election are as high as they‚Äôve ever been.   That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm running for president.   If you‚Äôve heard about Project 2025 then you are still in the minority of American voters. The media is only beginning to wake up to what they‚Äôve called the blueprint for American fascism.   And there is plenty in this plan that is alarming. The ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù include:   A mass purge of dedicated civil servants from every federal agency to be replaced by unqualified lackeys chosen for their loyalty to the Republican president.   A deportation regime targeting millions of undocumented Americans and rounding them up into concentration camps to stage them for removal from the country.   Putting a target squarely on the 2SLGBTQIA+ community by declaring all media and materials that even mention LGBTQ identities as ‚Äúpornography‚Äù and placing anyone who publishes LGBTQ+ friendly-materials onto a government watchlist.   Formally weaponizing federal law enforcement agencies to answer to the whims of the president and even nationalizing local police forces.   This is just a taste of what this 900-page plan entails. But here‚Äôs what they haven‚Äôt told you‚Ä¶   This has been the Republican agenda for more than 40 years.   Project 2025 is the latest iteration of the Heritage Foundation‚Äôs ‚ÄúMandate for Leadership‚Äù drafted for Ronald Reagan in his first administration. Since then it has repeatedly evolved to incorporate new and terrible plans to expand the powers of the presidency enrich the billionaire class forcibly install Christian Nationalism as a governing doctrine and convert our pluralistic democracy into the white supremacist police state they‚Äôve always dreamed of.   The real danger of Project 2025 is that with a successful complete right-wing takeover of our courts Republicans now have all the tools they need to make it a reality ‚Äì and Democrats have done nothing to stop them.   We saw this with last week‚Äôs Supreme Court decision declaring that presidents are officially above the law. And how did Joe Biden respond to this a death blow to our constitution?   He said ‚ÄúI dissent‚Äù and tepidly promised to never abuse his new powers.   Joe Biden is right about one thing ‚Äì democracy IS on the ballot this year.   But he‚Äôs wrong about this: Democrats cannot and will not save us.   We have to get real about the threats we‚Äôre facing.   This election will decide the future of our planet and the survival of our species as we confront an ever-accelerating climate emergency.   This election will decide whether or not women will remain second class citizens without full autonomy over our bodies and our lives.   This election will decide if our 2SLGBTQIA+ siblings will see all of their hard-won rights stripped away in the face of escalating harassment abuse and violence.   This election will decide if we continue to fund and facilitate the extermination of an entire people in Palestine and whether we allow that barbarity to expand into a regional war that pulls in our own troops and makes us even more complicit in Israel‚Äôs war crimes.   This election will decide a lot of things not the least of which is whether or not we continue to exist as the UNITED states of America.   With so much on the line we have to be honest about our options.   Republicans have proudly broadcast their plans for more than 40 years. Democrats have done NOTHING to meaningfully stay the right wing‚Äôs fascist ambitions ‚Äì and in more ways than I can begin to enumerate Democrats have actively advanced those ambitions.   As Biden‚Äôs approval ratings and electoral chances continue to plummet THIS is what Kevin Robertson president of the Heritage Foundation and principal architect of Project 2025 has to say about their plans:   ‚ÄúWe are in the process of the second American Revolution which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.‚Äù   That is a threat and it must be treated as such.   Joe Biden cannot and will not meet this moment but I will.  Ours is the ONLY pro-worker pro-planet pro-peace anti-genocide campaign that will be on the ballot everywhere this November. After that disastrous debate millions of American voters are re-examining their options ‚Äì and they need to hear from us.   In his recent interview with George Stephanopoulos Biden was asked how he would feel if despite all the warnings and the hundreds of millions of dollars Democrats are raising Trump actually wins and all of this comes to pass.   Biden‚Äôs answer was: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did as good a job as I know I can do that‚Äôs what this is about.‚Äù   That‚Äôs his answer to the threat of American fascism and the collapse of American leadership on the world stage: ‚ÄúAt least I did my best.‚Äù   It reveals a cold hard truth about the president and every member of our political elite: if Trump is re-elected they will be fine.   They‚Äôll go back to fundraising for the next election. They‚Äôll run to K-Street and cash in as lobbyists. Or they‚Äôll retire to Martha‚Äôs Vineyard.   The elites will survive a second Trump presidency without a hitch. It is always the most vulnerable who pay the price for repeated Democratic failures and betrayals.   I need your financial support to get our campaign out to every voter looking for a president who will actually fight for our democracy as if lives are on the line ‚Äì because they are.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President thank you for doing this.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Thank you for having me.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let‚Äôs start with the debate. eh You and your team said have said you had a bad night. But your‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Sure did.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But your friend Nancy Pelosi actually framed the question that I think is on the minds of millions of Americans. Was this a bad episode or the sign of a more serious condition?  &lt;!-- more --&gt; PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: It was a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn‚Äôt listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and‚Äì and a bad night.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You know you say you were exhausted. And‚Äì and I know you‚Äôve said that before as well but you came‚Äì and you did have a tough month. But you came home from Europe about 11 or 12 days before the debate spent six days in Camp David. Why wasn‚Äôt that enough rest time enough recovery time?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Because I was sick. I was feeling terrible. Matter of fact the docs with me. I asked if they did a COVID test because they‚Äôre trying to figure out what was wrong. They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection you know a virus. I didn‚Äôt. I just had a really bad cold.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And‚Äì did you ever watch the debate afterwards?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don‚Äôt think I did no.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well what I‚Äôm try‚Äì what I want to get at is what were you experiencing as you were going through the debate? Did you know how badly it was going?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yeah look. The whole way I prepared nobody‚Äôs fault mine. Nobody‚Äôs fault but mine. I uh‚Äì I prepared what I usually would do sittin‚Äô down as I did come back with foreign leaders or National Security Council for explicit detail. And I realized‚Äìbout partway through that you know all‚Äì I get quoted the New York Times had me down at ten points before the debate nine now or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is what I looked at is that he also lied 28 times. I couldn‚Äôt‚Äì I mean the way the debate ran not‚Äì my fault no one else‚Äôs fault no one else‚Äôs fault.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But it seemed like you were having trouble from the first question in even before he spoke.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I just had a bad night. You‚Äôve had some bad interviews once in a while. I‚Äì I can‚Äôt remember any but I‚Äôm sure you did.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äôve had plenty. I guess the question of‚Äì the problem is here for a lot of Americans watching is you‚Äôve said going back to 2020 ‚ÄúWatch me‚Äù to people who are concerned about your age. And you know 50 million Americans watched that debate. It seemed to confirm fears they already had.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well look. After that debate I did ten major events in a row including until 2:00 in the morning after the debate. I did events in North Carolina. I did events in‚Äîin in Georgia did events like this today large crowds overwhelming response no‚Äì no‚Äì no slipping. And so I just had a bad night. I don‚Äôt know why.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And‚Äì how‚Äì how quickly did it‚Äì did it come to you that you were having that bad night?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well it came to me I was havin‚Äô a bad night when I realized that even when I was answering a question even though they turned his mic off he was still shouting. And I‚Äì I let it distract me. I‚Äì I‚Äôm not blaming it on that but I realized that I just wasn‚Äôt in control.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Part of the other concern is that‚Äì this seems to fit into a pattern of decline that has been reported on recently. New York Times had a headline on July 2nd ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs lapses are said to be increasingly common and worrisome.‚Äù Here‚Äôs what they wrote.  ‚ÄúPeople who‚Äôve spent time with President Biden over the last few months or so said the lapses appear to have grown more frequent more pronounced and after Thursday d‚Äì Thursday‚Äôs debate more worrisome. By many accounts as evidenced by video footage observation and interviews Mr. Biden is not the same today as he was even when he took office three-and-a-half years ago.‚Äù Similar reporting in The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. Are you the same man today that you were when you took office three-and-a-half years ago?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: In terms of successes yes. I also was the guy who put together a peace plan for the Middle East that may be comin‚Äô to fruition. I was also the guy that expanded NATO. I was also the guy that grew the economy. All the individual things that were done were ideas I had or I fulfilled. I moved on.  And so for example you know ‚ÄúWe-Well that was true then what‚Äôs Biden done lately?‚Äù Di-you-just just see today just announced 200000 new jobs. We‚Äôre movin‚Äô in the direction that no one‚Äôs ever taken on. I know you know this from days in‚Äì in‚Äì in the‚Äì in the government.  I took on big pharma. I beat them. No one said I could beat them. I took on all the things we said we got done were told we couldn‚Äôt get done. And part of it is what I said when I ran was I wanted to do three things: Restore some decency to the office restore some support for the middle class instead of trickle down economics both from the middle out and the bottom up the way the wealthy still do fine everyone does better and unite the country.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But what has all that work over the last three-and-a-half years cost you physically mentally emotionally?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I‚Äì I‚Äì I just think it cost me a really bad night bad run but you know I‚Äì George. I have‚Äì I‚Äôm optimistic about this country. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre a country of losers that he points out. I don‚Äôt think America‚Äôs in tough shape. I think America is on the cusp of breaking through in so many incredible opportunities.  In this next term I‚Äôm gonna make sure we gotta‚Äì straighten out the tax system. I‚Äôm gonna make sure we‚Äôre in a situation where we have healthcare for all people where we‚Äôre in a position where we have‚Äì have childcare and eldercare free up‚Äì and all these things.  One thing I‚Äôm proudest of is remember when my economic plan was put forward? A lot of the mainstream economists said ‚ÄúThis is not gonna work.‚Äù Guess what? We now have 16 Nobel laureates 16 of ‚Äòem in economics saying that ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs next term would be a sig‚Äì enor‚Äì based on what he wants to do enormous success.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs plan would cause a recession and sig-nif‚Äì gi‚Äì increase inflation. I‚Äôve made great progress and that‚Äôs what I plan on doin‚Äô. And we can do this.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äì I‚Äì I understand that and I‚Äôm not disputing that. What I‚Äôm asking you is‚Äì about your personal situation. Do you dispute that there have been more lapses especially in the last several months?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Can I run the 100 in 10 flat? No. But I‚Äôm still in good shape.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Are you more frail?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: No.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Come keep my schedule. (LAUGH)  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you spoke with your doctor after the debate. What did he say?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: He said he‚Äì just looked at me and said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exhausted.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. I have medical doctors travel with me everywhere. Every President does as you know. Medical doctors some of the best in the world travel with me everywhere I go. I have an ongoing assessment of what I‚Äôm doin‚Äô and they don‚Äôt hesitate to tell me if they think there‚Äôs something wrong.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you said you have an ongoing assessment. Have you had a full neurological and cognitive evaluation?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôve had‚Äì I get a full neurological test everyday with me. And I‚Äôve had a full physical. I had you know I mean I‚Äì I‚Äôve been at Walter Reed for my physicals. I mean‚Äìuhm yes the answer.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äì I know your doctor said he consulted with a neurologist. I‚Äì I guess I‚Äôm asking‚Äì a slightly different question. Have you had the specific cognitive tests and have you had a neurologist a specialist do an examination?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: No. No one said I had to. No one said. They said I‚Äôm good.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Would you be willing to undergo an independent medical evaluation that included neurological and cognit‚Äì cognitive tests and release the results to the American people?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Look. I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test. Everything I do. You know not only am I campaigning but I‚Äôm running the world. Not‚Äì and that‚Äôs not hi‚Äì sounds like hyperbole but we are the essential nation of the world..  Madeleine Albright was right. And every single day for example today before I came out here I‚Äôm on the phone with‚Äì with the prime minister of‚Äì well anyway I shouldn‚Äôt get into detail but with Netanyahu. I‚Äôm on the phone with the new prime minister of England.  I‚Äôm workin‚Äô on what we were doin‚Äô with regard to‚Äì in Europe with regard to expansion of NATO and whether it‚Äôs gonna stick. I‚Äôm takin‚Äô on Putin. I mean every day there‚Äôs no day I go through there not those decisions I have to make every single day.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And you have been doing that and the American people have been watching yet their concerns about your age and your health are growing. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking ‚Äì to reassure them would you be willing to have the independent medical evaluation?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Watch me between‚Äì there‚Äôs a lotta time left in this campaign. There‚Äôs over 125 days.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So the answer‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: They‚Äôll make a decision.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Right‚Äîthe answer right now is no you‚Äì you don‚Äôt want to do that right now.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I‚Äôve already done it.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You talked a lot about your successes in‚Äì at the beginning of this interview. And‚Äì and I don‚Äôt want to dispute that I don‚Äôt want to debate that. But‚Äì as you know elections are about the future not the past. They‚Äôre about tomorrow not yesterday. And the question on so many people‚Äôs minds right now is ‚ÄúCan you serve effectively for the next four years?‚Äù  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: George. I‚Äôm the guy that put NATO together the future. No one thought I could expand it. I‚Äôm the guy that shut Putin down. No one thought could happen. I‚Äôm the guy that put together a South Pacific initiative with AUKUS. I‚Äôm the guy that got 50 nations out‚Äì not only in Europe outside of Europe as well to help Ukraine.  I‚Äôm the guy that got Japanese to expand their budget. I‚Äôm the‚Äì so I mean these‚Äì and for example when I decided we used to have 40% of computer chips. We invented the chip the little chip the computer chip. It‚Äôs in everything from cell phone to weapons.  And so we used to have 40% and we‚Äôre down to virtually nothing. So I get in the plane against the advice of everybody and I fly to South Korea. I convince them to invest in the United States billions of dollars. Now we have tens of billions of dollars being invested in the United States making us back in a position we‚Äôre gonna own that industry again. We have I mean I‚Äì I just‚Äì anyway. I‚Äôm‚Äì I don‚Äôt wanna take too much credit. I have a great staff.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But hold on. My‚Äì I guess my point is all that takes a toll. Do you have the mental and physical capacity to do it for another four years?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I believes so I wouldn‚Äôt be runnin‚Äô if I didn‚Äôt think I did. Look I‚Äôm runnin‚Äô again because I think I understand best what has to be done to take this nation to a completely new new level. We‚Äôre on our way. We‚Äôre on our way. And look. The decision recently made by the Supreme Court on immunity you know the next President of the United States it‚Äôs not just about whether he or she knows what they‚Äôre doin‚Äô.  It‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs not‚Äì not about a con‚Äì a conglomerate of people making decisions. It‚Äôs about the character of the President. The character of the President‚Äôs gonna determine whether or not this Constitution is employed the right way.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you a tougher more personal question. Are you sure you‚Äôre being honest with yourself when you say you have the mental and physical capacity to serve another four years?  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you a tougher more personal question. Are you sure you‚Äôre being honest with yourself when you say you have the mental and physical capacity to serve another four years?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yes I am because George the last thing I want to do is not be able to meet that. I think as some of senior economist and senior foreign policy specialists say if I stop now I‚Äôd go down in history as a pretty successful President. No one thought I could get done what we got done.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But are you being with honest‚Äì with yourself as well about your ability to defeat Donald Trump right now?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yes. Yes yes yes.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You say that and let me challenge you.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Sure.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Because you were close but behind going into the debate. You‚Äôre further behind now by‚Äì by any measure. It‚Äôs been a two-man race for several months. Inflation has come down. In those last few months he‚Äôs become a convicted felon. Yet you‚Äôre still falling further behind.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: You guys keep saying that. George do you‚Äì look you know polling better than anybody. Do you think polling data as accurate as it used to be?  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I don‚Äôt think so but I think when you look at all the polling data right now it shows that he‚Äôs certainly ahead in the popular vote probably even more ahead in the battleground states. And one of the other key factors there is it shows that in many of the battleground states the Democrats who are running for Senate and the House are doing better than you are.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That‚Äôs not unusual in some states. I carried an awful lotta Democrats last time I ran in 2020. Look I remember them tellin‚Äô me the same thing in 2020. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt win. The polls show I can‚Äôt win.‚Äù Remember 2024‚Äì 2020 the red wave was coming.  Before the vote I said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not gonna happen. We‚Äôre gonna win.‚Äù We did better in an off-year than almost any incumbent President ever has done. They said in 2023 (STATIC) all the tough (UNINTEL) we‚Äôre not gonna win. I went into all those areas and all those‚Äì all those districts and we won.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: All that is true but 2020 was a close race. And your approval rating has dropped significantly since then. I think the last poll I saw was at about 36%.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Woah woah woah  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: The number of Americans who think you‚Äôre too old to serve has doubled since 2020. Wouldn‚Äôt a clear-eyed political calculus tell you that it‚Äôs gonna be much tougher to win in 2024?.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Not when you‚Äôre running against a pathological liar. Not when he hadn‚Äôt been challenged in a way that he‚Äôs about to be challenged. Not when people‚Äì  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You‚Äôve had months to challenge him.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Oh sure I had months but I was also doin‚Äô a hell of a lot of other things like wars around the world like keeping NATO together like working‚Äì anyway. But look.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you really believe you‚Äôre not behind right now?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I think it‚Äôs in‚Äì all the pollsters I talk to tell me it‚Äôs a tossup. It‚Äôs a tossup. And when I‚Äôm behind there‚Äôs only one poll I‚Äôm really far behind CBS Poll and NBC I mean excuse me. And‚Äì uh‚Äì  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: New York‚Äì New York Times and NBC both have‚Äì have you about six points behind in the popular vote.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That‚Äôs exactly right. New York Times had me behind before anything having to do with this race‚Äì had me hind‚Äì behind ten points. Ten points they had me behind. Nothing‚Äôs changed substantially since the debate in the New York Times poll.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Just when you look at the reality though Mr. President I mean you won the popular vote‚Äì in‚Äì in 2020 but it was still deadly close in the electoral college‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: By 7 million votes.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. But you‚Äôre behind now in the popular vote.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don‚Äôt‚Äì I don‚Äôt buy that.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Is it worth the risk?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don‚Äôt think anybody‚Äôs more qualified to be President or win this race than me.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You know the heart of your case against Donald Trump is that he‚Äôs only out for himself putting his personal interests ahead of the national interest. How do you respond to critics who say that by staying in the race you‚Äôre doing the same thing?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Oh come on. Well I don‚Äôt think those critics know what they‚Äôre talkin‚Äô about.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: They‚Äôre just wrong?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: They‚Äôre just wrong. Look Trump is a pathological liar. Trump is‚Äì he is‚Äì you ever seen anything Trump did that benefited sa‚Äì somebody else and not him? You can‚Äôt answer I know.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äôve‚Äì I‚Äôve questioned him and his allies as persistently as any journalist has.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Oh I know you have. I‚Äôm not being critical. I‚Äôm not being critical but look I mean the man is a congenital liar. As I said they pointed out in that debate he lied 27‚Äì 28 times‚Äì times whatever number over 20 times. Talk about how good his economy was how he brought down inflation how‚Äì this is a guy who unlike‚Äì only other President oth‚Äì other than him is Hoover who lost more jobs than he created.  This is a guy who told us to put bleach in our arms to deal with COVID with a million‚Äì over a million people died. This is a guy who talks about wantin‚Äô to get rid of the healthcare provision we put in place. This is a guy who wants to give the power back to big pharma to be able to charge exorbitant prices for drugs. This is a guy who wants to undo every single thing I‚Äôve done every single‚Äì every single thing.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I understand that. I understand that‚Äôs why you want to stay in the race but have you convinced yourself that only you can defeat him?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I convinced myself of two things. I‚Äôm the most qualified person to beat him and I know how to get things done.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: If you can be convinced that you cannot defeat Donald Trump will you stand down?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: (LAUGH)- It depends on‚Äì on if the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that I might do that.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well if‚Äì I mean on a more practical level The Washington Post just reported in the last hour that Senator Mark Warner is‚Äì is assembling a group of Senators together to try and convince you to stand down because they don‚Äôt think you can win.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well Mark is a good man. We‚Äôve never had (UNINTEL). He also tried to get the nomination too. Mark‚Äôs not‚Äì Mark and I have a different perspective. I respect him.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And if Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi come down and say ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre worried that if you stay in the race we‚Äôre gonna lose the House and the Senate‚Äù how will you respond?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äì I‚Äôd go into detail with them. I‚Äôve speaken (PH) to all of them in detail including Jim Clyburn every one of &#x27;em. They all said I should stay in the race‚Äì stay in the race. No one said‚Äì none of the people said I should leave.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But if they do?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well it‚Äôs like (LAUGH) they‚Äôre not gonna do that.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You‚Äôre sure?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well Yeah I‚Äôm sure. Look. I mean if the Lord Almighty came down and said ‚ÄúJoe get outta the race‚Äù I‚Äôd get outta the race. The Lord Almighty‚Äôs not comin‚Äô down. I mean these hypotheticals George if I mean it‚Äôs all‚Äì  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But‚Äì but it‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs not that hypothetical anymore. I‚Äì I‚Äì I‚Äì I grant that the‚Äì they have not k‚Äì requested a meeting but it‚Äôs been reported‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: But they‚Äì I met with them. I met with a lotta these people. I talk with them regularly. I had an hour conversation with Hakeem. I had more time (UNITEL)with Jim Clyburn. I spent time with many hours off and on in the last little bit with Chuck Schumer. It‚Äôs not like‚Äì I had all the governors‚Äì all the governors.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I agree that the Lord Almighty‚Äôs not gonna come down but if‚Äì if‚Äì if you are told reliably from your allies from your friends and supporters in the Democratic Party in the House and the Senate that they‚Äôre concerned you‚Äôre gonna lose the House and the Senate if you stay in what will you do?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôm not gonna answer that question. It‚Äôs not gonna happen.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: What‚Äôs your plan to turn the campaign around?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: You saw it today. How many‚Äì how many people draw crowds like I did today? Find me more enthusiastic than today? Huh?  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I mean have‚Äì I don‚Äôt think you wanna play the crowd game. Donald Trump can draw big crowds. There‚Äôs no question about that.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: He can draw a big crowd but what does he say? Who‚Äì who does he have? I‚Äôm the guy supposedly in trouble. We raised $38 million within four days after this. Over‚Äì we have over a million individual contributors individual contributors. That‚Äì that‚Äôs less than 200 bucks. We have‚Äì I mean I‚Äôm not seen what you‚Äôre‚Äì you‚Äôre proposing.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You haven‚Äôt seen the‚Äì the fall-off in the polls? You haven‚Äôt seen the reports of discontent in the Democratic Party House Democrats Senate Democrats?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôve seen it from the press.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You know I‚Äôve heard from dozens of your supporters over the last few days and a variety of views I grant you that. But the prevailing sentiment is this. They love you and they will be forever grateful to you for defeating Donald Trump in 2020.  They think you‚Äôve done a great job as President a lot of the successes you outlined. But they are worried about you and the country. And they don‚Äôt think you can win. They want you to go with grace and they will cheer you if you do. What do you say to that?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I say the vast majority are not where that‚Äì those folks are. I don‚Äôt doubt there are some folks there. Have you ever seen a group‚Äì ta‚Äì time when elected officials running for office aren‚Äôt little worried? Have you ever seen that? I‚Äôve not. Same thing happened in 2020. ‚ÄúOh Biden I don‚Äôt know. Man what‚Äôs he gonna do? He may bring me down he may (PH).‚Äù  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President I‚Äôve never seen a President 36% approval get reelected.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs my approval rating. That‚Äôs not what our polls show.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And if you stay in and Trump is elected and everything you‚Äôre warning about comes to pass how will you feel in January?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do that‚Äôs what this is about. Look George. Think of it this way. You‚Äôve heard me say this before. I think the United States and the world is at an inflection point when the things that happen in the next several years are gonna determine what the next six seven decades are gonna be like.  And who‚Äôs gonna be able to hold NATO together like me? Who‚Äôs gonna be able to be in a position where I‚Äôm able to keep the Pacific Basin in a position where we‚Äôre‚Äì we‚Äôre at least checkmating China now? Who‚Äôs gonna‚Äì who‚Äôs gonna do that? Who has that reach? Who has‚Äì who knows all these pe‚Ä¶? We‚Äôre gonna have I guess a good way to judge me is you‚Äôre gonna have now the NATO conference here in the United States next week. Come listen. See what they say.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President thanks for your time.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Thank you. Appreciate it.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President thank you for doing this.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Thank you for having me.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let‚Äôs start with the debate. eh You and your team said have said you had a bad night. But your‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Sure did.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But your friend Nancy Pelosi actually framed the question that I think is on the minds of millions of Americans. Was this a bad episode or the sign of a more serious condition?  &lt;!-- more --&gt; PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: It was a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn‚Äôt listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and‚Äì and a bad night.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You know you say you were exhausted. And‚Äì and I know you‚Äôve said that before as well but you came‚Äì and you did have a tough month. But you came home from Europe about 11 or 12 days before the debate spent six days in Camp David. Why wasn‚Äôt that enough rest time enough recovery time?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Because I was sick. I was feeling terrible. Matter of fact the docs with me. I asked if they did a COVID test because they‚Äôre trying to figure out what was wrong. They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection you know a virus. I didn‚Äôt. I just had a really bad cold.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And‚Äì did you ever watch the debate afterwards?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don‚Äôt think I did no.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well what I‚Äôm try‚Äì what I want to get at is what were you experiencing as you were going through the debate? Did you know how badly it was going?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yeah look. The whole way I prepared nobody‚Äôs fault mine. Nobody‚Äôs fault but mine. I uh‚Äì I prepared what I usually would do sittin‚Äô down as I did come back with foreign leaders or National Security Council for explicit detail. And I realized‚Äìbout partway through that you know all‚Äì I get quoted the New York Times had me down at ten points before the debate nine now or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is what I looked at is that he also lied 28 times. I couldn‚Äôt‚Äì I mean the way the debate ran not‚Äì my fault no one else‚Äôs fault no one else‚Äôs fault.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But it seemed like you were having trouble from the first question in even before he spoke.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I just had a bad night. You‚Äôve had some bad interviews once in a while. I‚Äì I can‚Äôt remember any but I‚Äôm sure you did.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äôve had plenty. I guess the question of‚Äì the problem is here for a lot of Americans watching is you‚Äôve said going back to 2020 ‚ÄúWatch me‚Äù to people who are concerned about your age. And you know 50 million Americans watched that debate. It seemed to confirm fears they already had.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well look. After that debate I did ten major events in a row including until 2:00 in the morning after the debate. I did events in North Carolina. I did events in‚Äîin in Georgia did events like this today large crowds overwhelming response no‚Äì no‚Äì no slipping. And so I just had a bad night. I don‚Äôt know why.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And‚Äì how‚Äì how quickly did it‚Äì did it come to you that you were having that bad night?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well it came to me I was havin‚Äô a bad night when I realized that even when I was answering a question even though they turned his mic off he was still shouting. And I‚Äì I let it distract me. I‚Äì I‚Äôm not blaming it on that but I realized that I just wasn‚Äôt in control.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Part of the other concern is that‚Äì this seems to fit into a pattern of decline that has been reported on recently. New York Times had a headline on July 2nd ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs lapses are said to be increasingly common and worrisome.‚Äù Here‚Äôs what they wrote.  ‚ÄúPeople who‚Äôve spent time with President Biden over the last few months or so said the lapses appear to have grown more frequent more pronounced and after Thursday d‚Äì Thursday‚Äôs debate more worrisome. By many accounts as evidenced by video footage observation and interviews Mr. Biden is not the same today as he was even when he took office three-and-a-half years ago.‚Äù Similar reporting in The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. Are you the same man today that you were when you took office three-and-a-half years ago?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: In terms of successes yes. I also was the guy who put together a peace plan for the Middle East that may be comin‚Äô to fruition. I was also the guy that expanded NATO. I was also the guy that grew the economy. All the individual things that were done were ideas I had or I fulfilled. I moved on.  And so for example you know ‚ÄúWe-Well that was true then what‚Äôs Biden done lately?‚Äù Di-you-just just see today just announced 200000 new jobs. We‚Äôre movin‚Äô in the direction that no one‚Äôs ever taken on. I know you know this from days in‚Äì in‚Äì in the‚Äì in the government.  I took on big pharma. I beat them. No one said I could beat them. I took on all the things we said we got done were told we couldn‚Äôt get done. And part of it is what I said when I ran was I wanted to do three things: Restore some decency to the office restore some support for the middle class instead of trickle down economics both from the middle out and the bottom up the way the wealthy still do fine everyone does better and unite the country.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But what has all that work over the last three-and-a-half years cost you physically mentally emotionally?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I‚Äì I‚Äì I just think it cost me a really bad night bad run but you know I‚Äì George. I have‚Äì I‚Äôm optimistic about this country. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre a country of losers that he points out. I don‚Äôt think America‚Äôs in tough shape. I think America is on the cusp of breaking through in so many incredible opportunities.  In this next term I‚Äôm gonna make sure we gotta‚Äì straighten out the tax system. I‚Äôm gonna make sure we‚Äôre in a situation where we have healthcare for all people where we‚Äôre in a position where we have‚Äì have childcare and eldercare free up‚Äì and all these things.  One thing I‚Äôm proudest of is remember when my economic plan was put forward? A lot of the mainstream economists said ‚ÄúThis is not gonna work.‚Äù Guess what? We now have 16 Nobel laureates 16 of ‚Äòem in economics saying that ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs next term would be a sig‚Äì enor‚Äì based on what he wants to do enormous success.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs plan would cause a recession and sig-nif‚Äì gi‚Äì increase inflation. I‚Äôve made great progress and that‚Äôs what I plan on doin‚Äô. And we can do this.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äì I‚Äì I understand that and I‚Äôm not disputing that. What I‚Äôm asking you is‚Äì about your personal situation. Do you dispute that there have been more lapses especially in the last several months?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Can I run the 100 in 10 flat? No. But I‚Äôm still in good shape.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Are you more frail?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: No.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Come keep my schedule. (LAUGH)  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you spoke with your doctor after the debate. What did he say?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: He said he‚Äì just looked at me and said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exhausted.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. I have medical doctors travel with me everywhere. Every President does as you know. Medical doctors some of the best in the world travel with me everywhere I go. I have an ongoing assessment of what I‚Äôm doin‚Äô and they don‚Äôt hesitate to tell me if they think there‚Äôs something wrong.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you said you have an ongoing assessment. Have you had a full neurological and cognitive evaluation?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôve had‚Äì I get a full neurological test everyday with me. And I‚Äôve had a full physical. I had you know I mean I‚Äì I‚Äôve been at Walter Reed for my physicals. I mean‚Äìuhm yes the answer.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äì I know your doctor said he consulted with a neurologist. I‚Äì I guess I‚Äôm asking‚Äì a slightly different question. Have you had the specific cognitive tests and have you had a neurologist a specialist do an examination?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: No. No one said I had to. No one said. They said I‚Äôm good.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Would you be willing to undergo an independent medical evaluation that included neurological and cognit‚Äì cognitive tests and release the results to the American people?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Look. I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test. Everything I do. You know not only am I campaigning but I‚Äôm running the world. Not‚Äì and that‚Äôs not hi‚Äì sounds like hyperbole but we are the essential nation of the world..  Madeleine Albright was right. And every single day for example today before I came out here I‚Äôm on the phone with‚Äì with the prime minister of‚Äì well anyway I shouldn‚Äôt get into detail but with Netanyahu. I‚Äôm on the phone with the new prime minister of England.  I‚Äôm workin‚Äô on what we were doin‚Äô with regard to‚Äì in Europe with regard to expansion of NATO and whether it‚Äôs gonna stick. I‚Äôm takin‚Äô on Putin. I mean every day there‚Äôs no day I go through there not those decisions I have to make every single day.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And you have been doing that and the American people have been watching yet their concerns about your age and your health are growing. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking ‚Äì to reassure them would you be willing to have the independent medical evaluation?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Watch me between‚Äì there‚Äôs a lotta time left in this campaign. There‚Äôs over 125 days.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So the answer‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: They‚Äôll make a decision.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Right‚Äîthe answer right now is no you‚Äì you don‚Äôt want to do that right now.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I‚Äôve already done it.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You talked a lot about your successes in‚Äì at the beginning of this interview. And‚Äì and I don‚Äôt want to dispute that I don‚Äôt want to debate that. But‚Äì as you know elections are about the future not the past. They‚Äôre about tomorrow not yesterday. And the question on so many people‚Äôs minds right now is ‚ÄúCan you serve effectively for the next four years?‚Äù  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: George. I‚Äôm the guy that put NATO together the future. No one thought I could expand it. I‚Äôm the guy that shut Putin down. No one thought could happen. I‚Äôm the guy that put together a South Pacific initiative with AUKUS. I‚Äôm the guy that got 50 nations out‚Äì not only in Europe outside of Europe as well to help Ukraine.  I‚Äôm the guy that got Japanese to expand their budget. I‚Äôm the‚Äì so I mean these‚Äì and for example when I decided we used to have 40% of computer chips. We invented the chip the little chip the computer chip. It‚Äôs in everything from cell phone to weapons.  And so we used to have 40% and we‚Äôre down to virtually nothing. So I get in the plane against the advice of everybody and I fly to South Korea. I convince them to invest in the United States billions of dollars. Now we have tens of billions of dollars being invested in the United States making us back in a position we‚Äôre gonna own that industry again. We have I mean I‚Äì I just‚Äì anyway. I‚Äôm‚Äì I don‚Äôt wanna take too much credit. I have a great staff.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But hold on. My‚Äì I guess my point is all that takes a toll. Do you have the mental and physical capacity to do it for another four years?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I believes so I wouldn‚Äôt be runnin‚Äô if I didn‚Äôt think I did. Look I‚Äôm runnin‚Äô again because I think I understand best what has to be done to take this nation to a completely new new level. We‚Äôre on our way. We‚Äôre on our way. And look. The decision recently made by the Supreme Court on immunity you know the next President of the United States it‚Äôs not just about whether he or she knows what they‚Äôre doin‚Äô.  It‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs not‚Äì not about a con‚Äì a conglomerate of people making decisions. It‚Äôs about the character of the President. The character of the President‚Äôs gonna determine whether or not this Constitution is employed the right way.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you a tougher more personal question. Are you sure you‚Äôre being honest with yourself when you say you have the mental and physical capacity to serve another four years?  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you a tougher more personal question. Are you sure you‚Äôre being honest with yourself when you say you have the mental and physical capacity to serve another four years?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yes I am because George the last thing I want to do is not be able to meet that. I think as some of senior economist and senior foreign policy specialists say if I stop now I‚Äôd go down in history as a pretty successful President. No one thought I could get done what we got done.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But are you being with honest‚Äì with yourself as well about your ability to defeat Donald Trump right now?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yes. Yes yes yes.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You say that and let me challenge you.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Sure.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Because you were close but behind going into the debate. You‚Äôre further behind now by‚Äì by any measure. It‚Äôs been a two-man race for several months. Inflation has come down. In those last few months he‚Äôs become a convicted felon. Yet you‚Äôre still falling further behind.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: You guys keep saying that. George do you‚Äì look you know polling better than anybody. Do you think polling data as accurate as it used to be?  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I don‚Äôt think so but I think when you look at all the polling data right now it shows that he‚Äôs certainly ahead in the popular vote probably even more ahead in the battleground states. And one of the other key factors there is it shows that in many of the battleground states the Democrats who are running for Senate and the House are doing better than you are.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That‚Äôs not unusual in some states. I carried an awful lotta Democrats last time I ran in 2020. Look I remember them tellin‚Äô me the same thing in 2020. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt win. The polls show I can‚Äôt win.‚Äù Remember 2024‚Äì 2020 the red wave was coming.  Before the vote I said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not gonna happen. We‚Äôre gonna win.‚Äù We did better in an off-year than almost any incumbent President ever has done. They said in 2023 (STATIC) all the tough (UNINTEL) we‚Äôre not gonna win. I went into all those areas and all those‚Äì all those districts and we won.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: All that is true but 2020 was a close race. And your approval rating has dropped significantly since then. I think the last poll I saw was at about 36%.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Woah woah woah  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: The number of Americans who think you‚Äôre too old to serve has doubled since 2020. Wouldn‚Äôt a clear-eyed political calculus tell you that it‚Äôs gonna be much tougher to win in 2024?.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Not when you‚Äôre running against a pathological liar. Not when he hadn‚Äôt been challenged in a way that he‚Äôs about to be challenged. Not when people‚Äì  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You‚Äôve had months to challenge him.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Oh sure I had months but I was also doin‚Äô a hell of a lot of other things like wars around the world like keeping NATO together like working‚Äì anyway. But look.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you really believe you‚Äôre not behind right now?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I think it‚Äôs in‚Äì all the pollsters I talk to tell me it‚Äôs a tossup. It‚Äôs a tossup. And when I‚Äôm behind there‚Äôs only one poll I‚Äôm really far behind CBS Poll and NBC I mean excuse me. And‚Äì uh‚Äì  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: New York‚Äì New York Times and NBC both have‚Äì have you about six points behind in the popular vote.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That‚Äôs exactly right. New York Times had me behind before anything having to do with this race‚Äì had me hind‚Äì behind ten points. Ten points they had me behind. Nothing‚Äôs changed substantially since the debate in the New York Times poll.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Just when you look at the reality though Mr. President I mean you won the popular vote‚Äì in‚Äì in 2020 but it was still deadly close in the electoral college‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: By 7 million votes.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. But you‚Äôre behind now in the popular vote.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don‚Äôt‚Äì I don‚Äôt buy that.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Is it worth the risk?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don‚Äôt think anybody‚Äôs more qualified to be President or win this race than me.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You know the heart of your case against Donald Trump is that he‚Äôs only out for himself putting his personal interests ahead of the national interest. How do you respond to critics who say that by staying in the race you‚Äôre doing the same thing?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Oh come on. Well I don‚Äôt think those critics know what they‚Äôre talkin‚Äô about.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: They‚Äôre just wrong?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: They‚Äôre just wrong. Look Trump is a pathological liar. Trump is‚Äì he is‚Äì you ever seen anything Trump did that benefited sa‚Äì somebody else and not him? You can‚Äôt answer I know.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äôve‚Äì I‚Äôve questioned him and his allies as persistently as any journalist has.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Oh I know you have. I‚Äôm not being critical. I‚Äôm not being critical but look I mean the man is a congenital liar. As I said they pointed out in that debate he lied 27‚Äì 28 times‚Äì times whatever number over 20 times. Talk about how good his economy was how he brought down inflation how‚Äì this is a guy who unlike‚Äì only other President oth‚Äì other than him is Hoover who lost more jobs than he created.  This is a guy who told us to put bleach in our arms to deal with COVID with a million‚Äì over a million people died. This is a guy who talks about wantin‚Äô to get rid of the healthcare provision we put in place. This is a guy who wants to give the power back to big pharma to be able to charge exorbitant prices for drugs. This is a guy who wants to undo every single thing I‚Äôve done every single‚Äì every single thing.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I understand that. I understand that‚Äôs why you want to stay in the race but have you convinced yourself that only you can defeat him?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I convinced myself of two things. I‚Äôm the most qualified person to beat him and I know how to get things done.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: If you can be convinced that you cannot defeat Donald Trump will you stand down?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: (LAUGH)- It depends on‚Äì on if the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that I might do that.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well if‚Äì I mean on a more practical level The Washington Post just reported in the last hour that Senator Mark Warner is‚Äì is assembling a group of Senators together to try and convince you to stand down because they don‚Äôt think you can win.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well Mark is a good man. We‚Äôve never had (UNINTEL). He also tried to get the nomination too. Mark‚Äôs not‚Äì Mark and I have a different perspective. I respect him.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And if Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi come down and say ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre worried that if you stay in the race we‚Äôre gonna lose the House and the Senate‚Äù how will you respond?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äì I‚Äôd go into detail with them. I‚Äôve speaken (PH) to all of them in detail including Jim Clyburn every one of &#x27;em. They all said I should stay in the race‚Äì stay in the race. No one said‚Äì none of the people said I should leave.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But if they do?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well it‚Äôs like (LAUGH) they‚Äôre not gonna do that.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You‚Äôre sure?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well Yeah I‚Äôm sure. Look. I mean if the Lord Almighty came down and said ‚ÄúJoe get outta the race‚Äù I‚Äôd get outta the race. The Lord Almighty‚Äôs not comin‚Äô down. I mean these hypotheticals George if I mean it‚Äôs all‚Äì  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But‚Äì but it‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs not that hypothetical anymore. I‚Äì I‚Äì I‚Äì I grant that the‚Äì they have not k‚Äì requested a meeting but it‚Äôs been reported‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: But they‚Äì I met with them. I met with a lotta these people. I talk with them regularly. I had an hour conversation with Hakeem. I had more time (UNITEL)with Jim Clyburn. I spent time with many hours off and on in the last little bit with Chuck Schumer. It‚Äôs not like‚Äì I had all the governors‚Äì all the governors.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I agree that the Lord Almighty‚Äôs not gonna come down but if‚Äì if‚Äì if you are told reliably from your allies from your friends and supporters in the Democratic Party in the House and the Senate that they‚Äôre concerned you‚Äôre gonna lose the House and the Senate if you stay in what will you do?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôm not gonna answer that question. It‚Äôs not gonna happen.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: What‚Äôs your plan to turn the campaign around?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: You saw it today. How many‚Äì how many people draw crowds like I did today? Find me more enthusiastic than today? Huh?  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I mean have‚Äì I don‚Äôt think you wanna play the crowd game. Donald Trump can draw big crowds. There‚Äôs no question about that.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: He can draw a big crowd but what does he say? Who‚Äì who does he have? I‚Äôm the guy supposedly in trouble. We raised $38 million within four days after this. Over‚Äì we have over a million individual contributors individual contributors. That‚Äì that‚Äôs less than 200 bucks. We have‚Äì I mean I‚Äôm not seen what you‚Äôre‚Äì you‚Äôre proposing.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You haven‚Äôt seen the‚Äì the fall-off in the polls? You haven‚Äôt seen the reports of discontent in the Democratic Party House Democrats Senate Democrats?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôve seen it from the press.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You know I‚Äôve heard from dozens of your supporters over the last few days and a variety of views I grant you that. But the prevailing sentiment is this. They love you and they will be forever grateful to you for defeating Donald Trump in 2020.  They think you‚Äôve done a great job as President a lot of the successes you outlined. But they are worried about you and the country. And they don‚Äôt think you can win. They want you to go with grace and they will cheer you if you do. What do you say to that?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I say the vast majority are not where that‚Äì those folks are. I don‚Äôt doubt there are some folks there. Have you ever seen a group‚Äì ta‚Äì time when elected officials running for office aren‚Äôt little worried? Have you ever seen that? I‚Äôve not. Same thing happened in 2020. ‚ÄúOh Biden I don‚Äôt know. Man what‚Äôs he gonna do? He may bring me down he may (PH).‚Äù  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President I‚Äôve never seen a President 36% approval get reelected.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs my approval rating. That‚Äôs not what our polls show.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And if you stay in and Trump is elected and everything you‚Äôre warning about comes to pass how will you feel in January?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do that‚Äôs what this is about. Look George. Think of it this way. You‚Äôve heard me say this before. I think the United States and the world is at an inflection point when the things that happen in the next several years are gonna determine what the next six seven decades are gonna be like.  And who‚Äôs gonna be able to hold NATO together like me? Who‚Äôs gonna be able to be in a position where I‚Äôm able to keep the Pacific Basin in a position where we‚Äôre‚Äì we‚Äôre at least checkmating China now? Who‚Äôs gonna‚Äì who‚Äôs gonna do that? Who has that reach? Who has‚Äì who knows all these pe‚Ä¶? We‚Äôre gonna have I guess a good way to judge me is you‚Äôre gonna have now the NATO conference here in the United States next week. Come listen. See what they say.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President thanks for your time.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Thank you. Appreciate it.

6,Joe Biden,['election 2024'  'biden harris 2024'  'us politics'],lunadove,Honestly I do think we need to see how normalized Trump‚Äôs behavior has been to our country.  Biden had one bad debate performance and every single day since there have been waves of articles asking if Biden should step down.  Trump keeps getting basic facts mixed up (like the fact he‚Äôs running against Biden not Obama) lies constantly tried to overthrow the 2020 election had govt docs in Mar-A-Largo‚Äôs bathroom and Project 2025 has horrific consequences for the country.  And yet‚Ä¶nothing. I‚Äôve seen more articles wondering if Biden should step down due to a bad debate than articles about Project 2025.   The unspoken idea is that Biden is the adult in the room Trump can‚Äôt be reasoned with so if anything can be done to prevent a lot of people‚Äôs rights being taken away it‚Äôs on Biden and the Dems.   Which then gives people the impression that Biden and Trump are candidates on equal ground. Which they aren‚Äôt. The bar is on the floor for Trump.   Look how much pushback Biden got for a bad debate performance. We‚Äôre getting swamped with articles about how he should step down. Look how much pushback Trump is getting for any of the actions I listed above. No articles are coming out for him to step down bc everyone‚Äôs decided he can‚Äôt be reasoned with.  Honestly just please remember this if you‚Äôre thinking about not voting this Nov. The candidates are not equal elections have consequences and assuming that we‚Äôll have the same outcome if Biden gets elected or if Trump gets elected is due to a massive gaslighting campaign on the American people.,2024-07-08 16:48:51 GMT

Not Commander &amp; Chief Trump claimed he was going to build a wall along our southern border to protect our country. This wall would be paid for by Mexico as well. False &amp; false.  Trump started building a wall with funds from US taxpayers and shifting money from other government programs. Including military programs. Mexico paid not one cent towards the wall that is still incomplete to this day. Now Trump wants to blame democrats for a crisis at the border after he contacted his fellow republican members and instructed them to halt a bill that republicans created to help solve the problem once and for all. Because it would be another victory for Joe Biden and Trump wanted to run his campaign on the crisis at the border. So who‚Äôs to blame for the crisis at the border Donald?        Trump said he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with a better healthcare system known as Trumpcare. False &amp; false.  After insulting John McCain time and time again. Donald Trump needed his fellow republicans to seal a repeal of Obamacare. A sick and weakened John McCain came back to Washington to show that Donald Trump is not a leader and voted to keep Americans insured with Obamacare. Furthermore to this day not one person has seen the supposed replacement known as Trumpcare.        Trump said he‚Äôd drain the swamp. That all his wealthy friends would dislike him because of the taxes he‚Äôd place upon them. False &amp; false.  Trump enabled the wealthy to become even more wealthier by cutting theirs‚Äô and his taxes. The wealthy pay less than the middle class in the United States.

So you can see how seriously I‚Äôm taking this. You NEED to vote in the upcoming election if you want your rights protected ESPECIALLY if you‚Äôre a minority.  POC LGBTQA+ Disabled Financially Disadvantaged etc. please pay attention.   No ‚ÄúI hate both candidates‚Äù. No ‚ÄúBiden is terrible‚Äù. No ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting 3rd party‚Äù (That‚Äôs how we got Bush!) Yes I fucking hate Biden. He is complicit in genocide and so much more.  BUT you can NOT tell me another Trump term wouldn‚Äôt be 100000 times worse. Look at what happened during and after his 1st term. (If we‚Äôre lucky Biden will let someone else take his place)  I beg you to look up what the GOP Right Conservatives or whatever they want to call themselves with Project 2025.  You WILL lose EVERYTHING!   It‚Äôs a fundamental of DECONSTRUCTION of the government. Not in a good way.  They want to get rid of all protections. No protections from discrimination no workers protection even worse immigration policies more military power and so much more terrible bs.

Wait: I just saw the debate. That‚Äôs even worse. It‚Äôs a good thing the position is part-time or we‚Äôd be doomed. The temp job he staffs doesn‚Äôt require him to be prepared or energetic so there‚Äôs no need to fret about news breaking while waiting for dinner.  Someone in his ninth decade who‚Äôs always been a numbskull insists he can keep a job where work responsibilities can occur in any time zone. The technical commander-in-chief might need to deal with Kim Jong Un taking the parking brake off their nukes during North Korean business hours which might interrupt Joe Bide Un‚Äôs Woody Woodpecker time. The choice between a half-declined inveterate liar or a fully-declined one will make November even more fun than now.  What time is the meeting to establish if dropping out should be official? That‚Äôll determine whether they have to deal with Doctor Jekyll or Mister Bide. Dissolving the special energy vitamin in his chocolate milk is just another thankless task for the administration‚Äôs flunkies. You never praised them for making gasoline slightly cheaper than the mysteriously astronomical rate last summer under whoever headed the state then.  Biden‚Äôs cogency is like an eclipse: you appreciate it more because it‚Äôs rare. The only factor mitigating slumping is that he was sliding at the start. Anyone who endured him speaking at any time while he was vice president or senator knows cognitive deterioration began far before his oatmeal brain started leaking.  Friends and family must care about Grampy Joey if they want him to keep working. But cynics suspect close grifters may be motivated by more than having their beloved relative continue to feel purpose. Democrats think everyone else is a conniving schemer too.  Doctor Jill Biden violates the Hippocratic Oath with stubborn elder abuse. It‚Äôs tough to focus on medical ethics as a mob wife. The crime family needs their meal ticket to keep the title even if he isn‚Äôt technically doing anything presidential. For Democrats the claim is all it takes. Biden leads like Obamacare gave everyone awesome affordable insurance.  Life is worth whatever those in the compassionate faction conclude. From aborting the inconvenient to propping up a president who should be talking to a potted plant in a nursing home Democrats are consistent about how much they value others.  This White House‚Äôs sole skill is proving conspiracies true. If you‚Äôre a Democrat ticked that Biden stubbornly won‚Äôt retire despite his inability to perform complicated tasks like identifying himself without pointing to his name tag make sure you weren‚Äôt shrieking at Republicans a few weeks ago for noticing Biden needed to be led off the stage by his last manager.  Very fair journalists hope you forget like you‚Äôre the present president. Guardians of truth went from claiming Barack Obama guiding off Biden was a truther conspiracy to orchestrating scrambling for a replacement nominee faster than they went from claiming shutting down hairdressers for the sake of halting the virus was mandated for your own good to a voluntary wise suggestion.  Everything this addled president remembers he believes is based in pretending reality isn‚Äôt happening. The same media that lied about Hunter‚Äôs laptop the diverse mosaic that open borders would create how taking rights would keep you from getting sick and corporations discovering greed in 2021 claims Joe Biden‚Äôs rough debate was a one-off. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre honest this once.  The time to have a talk with Biden about not being president was in 1972. His cold‚Äôs primary symptom is getting everything wrong. He‚Äôs had it for over half a century. The incumbent came up with the notion of getting rich by printing more money before he forgot his career.  The 25th Amendment is just another they loathe. You may as well want to own an AR-15 while announcing why the government can‚Äôt prevent such. The genie‚Äôs wish always turns into a curse. As with inflation ruining the aforementioned cash handout scheme Biden‚Äôs party never learns to abandon quick fixes.  Pushy federal goons wanted a defiant president who refused to be constrained by niceties like waiting for Congress to pass a bill. Now the executive ordering specialist applies the same stubbornness to remaining sitting in his fancy swivel chair. Frankenstein whines about his monster.  Foes of vexing checks and balances have always wanted a king. Now he doesn‚Äôt have power and they still kvetch. A clandestine committee voting on one person‚Äôs alleged decisions is the closest Democrats get to democratic.  Wrestling fans enjoy pretend bouts despite knowing results are phony. Dispensing with the charade might work for a kayfabe presidency. Whoever‚Äôs really steering in the Oval Office while Biden sorts his Happy Meal toys might not be as effective as raising inflation despite best worst efforts. America‚Äôs best hope until 2029 is a country-ruining president who can‚Äôt complete his checklist anymore including writing it.  The figurative megalomaniacal understudy who performed the role for the election would act just as terribly. It‚Äôs ideas that matter which disappoints personality cults. The staff is already merely projecting goals based on estimating what the ostensible supervisor would want. The AI presidency is advanced considering the figurehead was born before color television.  The one-person branch is already being run by committee. Breaking yet another office rule is simultaneously dejecting and reassuring. Daft policies that could be churned out by algorithm show that idiocy is predictable even if the idiots change. Subtracting Biden‚Äôs regrettable personality would be the most pleasant part of his second try.  Why depose someone who can Velcro his own sneakers around midday? This term or the next wouldn‚Äôt change much upon conceding that the guy in charge isn‚Äôt. His mental meltdown offers the best chance to limit the damage he inflicts. The nation really lucked out.  Anyone honest is used to him being out of it. If it makes Democrats feel better Joe Biden was a nastily moronic failure when he could form words. He‚Äôs the lucky one: he doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs boss.,2024-07-08 16:00:23 GMT

3,Joe Biden,['jill biden'  'biden interview'  'biden intervention'  'campaign collapse'],grits-galraisedinthesouth,Full transcript of the ABC News exclusive interview with President Joe Biden.  120 DAYS TO ELECTION DAY  ABC‚Äôs George Stephanopoulos‚Äô exclusive interview with President Biden  July 5 2024 9:10 PM  One-on-one with President Biden: ABC News Exclusive  ABC‚Äôs George Stephanopoulos  President Joe Biden in his first television interview since his CNN debate with former President Donald Trump sat down with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos in Madison Wisconsin on Friday.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President thank you for doing this.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Thank you for having me.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let‚Äôs start with the debate. eh You and your team said have said you had a bad night. But your‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Sure did.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But your friend Nancy Pelosi actually framed the question that I think is on the minds of millions of Americans. Was this a bad episode or the sign of a more serious condition?  &lt;!-- more --&gt; PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: It was a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn‚Äôt listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and‚Äì and a bad night.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You know you say you were exhausted. And‚Äì and I know you‚Äôve said that before as well but you came‚Äì and you did have a tough month. But you came home from Europe about 11 or 12 days before the debate spent six days in Camp David. Why wasn‚Äôt that enough rest time enough recovery time?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Because I was sick. I was feeling terrible. Matter of fact the docs with me. I asked if they did a COVID test because they‚Äôre trying to figure out what was wrong. They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection you know a virus. I didn‚Äôt. I just had a really bad cold.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And‚Äì did you ever watch the debate afterwards?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don‚Äôt think I did no.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well what I‚Äôm try‚Äì what I want to get at is what were you experiencing as you were going through the debate? Did you know how badly it was going?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yeah look. The whole way I prepared nobody‚Äôs fault mine. Nobody‚Äôs fault but mine. I uh‚Äì I prepared what I usually would do sittin‚Äô down as I did come back with foreign leaders or National Security Council for explicit detail. And I realized‚Äìbout partway through that you know all‚Äì I get quoted the New York Times had me down at ten points before the debate nine now or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is what I looked at is that he also lied 28 times. I couldn‚Äôt‚Äì I mean the way the debate ran not‚Äì my fault no one else‚Äôs fault no one else‚Äôs fault.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But it seemed like you were having trouble from the first question in even before he spoke.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I just had a bad night. You‚Äôve had some bad interviews once in a while. I‚Äì I can‚Äôt remember any but I‚Äôm sure you did.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äôve had plenty. I guess the question of‚Äì the problem is here for a lot of Americans watching is you‚Äôve said going back to 2020 ‚ÄúWatch me‚Äù to people who are concerned about your age. And you know 50 million Americans watched that debate. It seemed to confirm fears they already had.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well look. After that debate I did ten major events in a row including until 2:00 in the morning after the debate. I did events in North Carolina. I did events in‚Äîin in Georgia did events like this today large crowds overwhelming response no‚Äì no‚Äì no slipping. And so I just had a bad night. I don‚Äôt know why.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And‚Äì how‚Äì how quickly did it‚Äì did it come to you that you were having that bad night?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well it came to me I was havin‚Äô a bad night when I realized that even when I was answering a question even though they turned his mic off he was still shouting. And I‚Äì I let it distract me. I‚Äì I‚Äôm not blaming it on that but I realized that I just wasn‚Äôt in control.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Part of the other concern is that‚Äì this seems to fit into a pattern of decline that has been reported on recently. New York Times had a headline on July 2nd ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs lapses are said to be increasingly common and worrisome.‚Äù Here‚Äôs what they wrote.  ‚ÄúPeople who‚Äôve spent time with President Biden over the last few months or so said the lapses appear to have grown more frequent more pronounced and after Thursday d‚Äì Thursday‚Äôs debate more worrisome. By many accounts as evidenced by video footage observation and interviews Mr. Biden is not the same today as he was even when he took office three-and-a-half years ago.‚Äù Similar reporting in The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. Are you the same man today that you were when you took office three-and-a-half years ago?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: In terms of successes yes. I also was the guy who put together a peace plan for the Middle East that may be comin‚Äô to fruition. I was also the guy that expanded NATO. I was also the guy that grew the economy. All the individual things that were done were ideas I had or I fulfilled. I moved on.  And so for example you know ‚ÄúWe-Well that was true then what‚Äôs Biden done lately?‚Äù Di-you-just just see today just announced 200000 new jobs. We‚Äôre movin‚Äô in the direction that no one‚Äôs ever taken on. I know you know this from days in‚Äì in‚Äì in the‚Äì in the government.  I took on big pharma. I beat them. No one said I could beat them. I took on all the things we said we got done were told we couldn‚Äôt get done. And part of it is what I said when I ran was I wanted to do three things: Restore some decency to the office restore some support for the middle class instead of trickle down economics both from the middle out and the bottom up the way the wealthy still do fine everyone does better and unite the country.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But what has all that work over the last three-and-a-half years cost you physically mentally emotionally?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I‚Äì I‚Äì I just think it cost me a really bad night bad run but you know I‚Äì George. I have‚Äì I‚Äôm optimistic about this country. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre a country of losers that he points out. I don‚Äôt think America‚Äôs in tough shape. I think America is on the cusp of breaking through in so many incredible opportunities.  In this next term I‚Äôm gonna make sure we gotta‚Äì straighten out the tax system. I‚Äôm gonna make sure we‚Äôre in a situation where we have healthcare for all people where we‚Äôre in a position where we have‚Äì have childcare and eldercare free up‚Äì and all these things.  One thing I‚Äôm proudest of is remember when my economic plan was put forward? A lot of the mainstream economists said ‚ÄúThis is not gonna work.‚Äù Guess what? We now have 16 Nobel laureates 16 of ‚Äòem in economics saying that ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs next term would be a sig‚Äì enor‚Äì based on what he wants to do enormous success.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs plan would cause a recession and sig-nif‚Äì gi‚Äì increase inflation. I‚Äôve made great progress and that‚Äôs what I plan on doin‚Äô. And we can do this.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äì I‚Äì I understand that and I‚Äôm not disputing that. What I‚Äôm asking you is‚Äì about your personal situation. Do you dispute that there have been more lapses especially in the last several months?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Can I run the 100 in 10 flat? No. But I‚Äôm still in good shape.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Are you more frail?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: No.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Come keep my schedule. (LAUGH)  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you spoke with your doctor after the debate. What did he say?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: He said he‚Äì just looked at me and said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exhausted.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. I have medical doctors travel with me everywhere. Every President does as you know. Medical doctors some of the best in the world travel with me everywhere I go. I have an ongoing assessment of what I‚Äôm doin‚Äô and they don‚Äôt hesitate to tell me if they think there‚Äôs something wrong.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you said you have an ongoing assessment. Have you had a full neurological and cognitive evaluation?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôve had‚Äì I get a full neurological test everyday with me. And I‚Äôve had a full physical. I had you know I mean I‚Äì I‚Äôve been at Walter Reed for my physicals. I mean‚Äìuhm yes the answer.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äì I know your doctor said he consulted with a neurologist. I‚Äì I guess I‚Äôm asking‚Äì a slightly different question. Have you had the specific cognitive tests and have you had a neurologist a specialist do an examination?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: No. No one said I had to. No one said. They said I‚Äôm good.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Would you be willing to undergo an independent medical evaluation that included neurological and cognit‚Äì cognitive tests and release the results to the American people?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Look. I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test. Everything I do. You know not only am I campaigning but I‚Äôm running the world. Not‚Äì and that‚Äôs not hi‚Äì sounds like hyperbole but we are the essential nation of the world..  Madeleine Albright was right. And every single day for example today before I came out here I‚Äôm on the phone with‚Äì with the prime minister of‚Äì well anyway I shouldn‚Äôt get into detail but with Netanyahu. I‚Äôm on the phone with the new prime minister of England.  I‚Äôm workin‚Äô on what we were doin‚Äô with regard to‚Äì in Europe with regard to expansion of NATO and whether it‚Äôs gonna stick. I‚Äôm takin‚Äô on Putin. I mean every day there‚Äôs no day I go through there not those decisions I have to make every single day.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And you have been doing that and the American people have been watching yet their concerns about your age and your health are growing. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking ‚Äì to reassure them would you be willing to have the independent medical evaluation?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Watch me between‚Äì there‚Äôs a lotta time left in this campaign. There‚Äôs over 125 days.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So the answer‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: They‚Äôll make a decision.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Right‚Äîthe answer right now is no you‚Äì you don‚Äôt want to do that right now.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I‚Äôve already done it.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You talked a lot about your successes in‚Äì at the beginning of this interview. And‚Äì and I don‚Äôt want to dispute that I don‚Äôt want to debate that. But‚Äì as you know elections are about the future not the past. They‚Äôre about tomorrow not yesterday. And the question on so many people‚Äôs minds right now is ‚ÄúCan you serve effectively for the next four years?‚Äù  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: George. I‚Äôm the guy that put NATO together the future. No one thought I could expand it. I‚Äôm the guy that shut Putin down. No one thought could happen. I‚Äôm the guy that put together a South Pacific initiative with AUKUS. I‚Äôm the guy that got 50 nations out‚Äì not only in Europe outside of Europe as well to help Ukraine.  I‚Äôm the guy that got Japanese to expand their budget. I‚Äôm the‚Äì so I mean these‚Äì and for example when I decided we used to have 40% of computer chips. We invented the chip the little chip the computer chip. It‚Äôs in everything from cell phone to weapons.  And so we used to have 40% and we‚Äôre down to virtually nothing. So I get in the plane against the advice of everybody and I fly to South Korea. I convince them to invest in the United States billions of dollars. Now we have tens of billions of dollars being invested in the United States making us back in a position we‚Äôre gonna own that industry again. We have I mean I‚Äì I just‚Äì anyway. I‚Äôm‚Äì I don‚Äôt wanna take too much credit. I have a great staff.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But hold on. My‚Äì I guess my point is all that takes a toll. Do you have the mental and physical capacity to do it for another four years?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I believes so I wouldn‚Äôt be runnin‚Äô if I didn‚Äôt think I did. Look I‚Äôm runnin‚Äô again because I think I understand best what has to be done to take this nation to a completely new new level. We‚Äôre on our way. We‚Äôre on our way. And look. The decision recently made by the Supreme Court on immunity you know the next President of the United States it‚Äôs not just about whether he or she knows what they‚Äôre doin‚Äô.  It‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs not‚Äì not about a con‚Äì a conglomerate of people making decisions. It‚Äôs about the character of the President. The character of the President‚Äôs gonna determine whether or not this Constitution is employed the right way.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you a tougher more personal question. Are you sure you‚Äôre being honest with yourself when you say you have the mental and physical capacity to serve another four years?  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you a tougher more personal question. Are you sure you‚Äôre being honest with yourself when you say you have the mental and physical capacity to serve another four years?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yes I am because George the last thing I want to do is not be able to meet that. I think as some of senior economist and senior foreign policy specialists say if I stop now I‚Äôd go down in history as a pretty successful President. No one thought I could get done what we got done.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But are you being with honest‚Äì with yourself as well about your ability to defeat Donald Trump right now?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yes. Yes yes yes.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You say that and let me challenge you.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Sure.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Because you were close but behind going into the debate. You‚Äôre further behind now by‚Äì by any measure. It‚Äôs been a two-man race for several months. Inflation has come down. In those last few months he‚Äôs become a convicted felon. Yet you‚Äôre still falling further behind.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: You guys keep saying that. George do you‚Äì look you know polling better than anybody. Do you think polling data as accurate as it used to be?  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I don‚Äôt think so but I think when you look at all the polling data right now it shows that he‚Äôs certainly ahead in the popular vote probably even more ahead in the battleground states. And one of the other key factors there is it shows that in many of the battleground states the Democrats who are running for Senate and the House are doing better than you are.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That‚Äôs not unusual in some states. I carried an awful lotta Democrats last time I ran in 2020. Look I remember them tellin‚Äô me the same thing in 2020. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt win. The polls show I can‚Äôt win.‚Äù Remember 2024‚Äì 2020 the red wave was coming.  Before the vote I said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not gonna happen. We‚Äôre gonna win.‚Äù We did better in an off-year than almost any incumbent President ever has done. They said in 2023 (STATIC) all the tough (UNINTEL) we‚Äôre not gonna win. I went into all those areas and all those‚Äì all those districts and we won.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: All that is true but 2020 was a close race. And your approval rating has dropped significantly since then. I think the last poll I saw was at about 36%.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Woah woah woah  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: The number of Americans who think you‚Äôre too old to serve has doubled since 2020. Wouldn‚Äôt a clear-eyed political calculus tell you that it‚Äôs gonna be much tougher to win in 2024?.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Not when you‚Äôre running against a pathological liar. Not when he hadn‚Äôt been challenged in a way that he‚Äôs about to be challenged. Not when people‚Äì  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You‚Äôve had months to challenge him.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Oh sure I had months but I was also doin‚Äô a hell of a lot of other things like wars around the world like keeping NATO together like working‚Äì anyway. But look.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you really believe you‚Äôre not behind right now?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I think it‚Äôs in‚Äì all the pollsters I talk to tell me it‚Äôs a tossup. It‚Äôs a tossup. And when I‚Äôm behind there‚Äôs only one poll I‚Äôm really far behind CBS Poll and NBC I mean excuse me. And‚Äì uh‚Äì  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: New York‚Äì New York Times and NBC both have‚Äì have you about six points behind in the popular vote.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That‚Äôs exactly right. New York Times had me behind before anything having to do with this race‚Äì had me hind‚Äì behind ten points. Ten points they had me behind. Nothing‚Äôs changed substantially since the debate in the New York Times poll.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Just when you look at the reality though Mr. President I mean you won the popular vote‚Äì in‚Äì in 2020 but it was still deadly close in the electoral college‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: By 7 million votes.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. But you‚Äôre behind now in the popular vote.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don‚Äôt‚Äì I don‚Äôt buy that.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Is it worth the risk?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don‚Äôt think anybody‚Äôs more qualified to be President or win this race than me.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You know the heart of your case against Donald Trump is that he‚Äôs only out for himself putting his personal interests ahead of the national interest. How do you respond to critics who say that by staying in the race you‚Äôre doing the same thing?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Oh come on. Well I don‚Äôt think those critics know what they‚Äôre talkin‚Äô about.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: They‚Äôre just wrong?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: They‚Äôre just wrong. Look Trump is a pathological liar. Trump is‚Äì he is‚Äì you ever seen anything Trump did that benefited sa‚Äì somebody else and not him? You can‚Äôt answer I know.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äôve‚Äì I‚Äôve questioned him and his allies as persistently as any journalist has.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Oh I know you have. I‚Äôm not being critical. I‚Äôm not being critical but look I mean the man is a congenital liar. As I said they pointed out in that debate he lied 27‚Äì 28 times‚Äì times whatever number over 20 times. Talk about how good his economy was how he brought down inflation how‚Äì this is a guy who unlike‚Äì only other President oth‚Äì other than him is Hoover who lost more jobs than he created.  This is a guy who told us to put bleach in our arms to deal with COVID with a million‚Äì over a million people died. This is a guy who talks about wantin‚Äô to get rid of the healthcare provision we put in place. This is a guy who wants to give the power back to big pharma to be able to charge exorbitant prices for drugs. This is a guy who wants to undo every single thing I‚Äôve done every single‚Äì every single thing.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I understand that. I understand that‚Äôs why you want to stay in the race but have you convinced yourself that only you can defeat him?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I convinced myself of two things. I‚Äôm the most qualified person to beat him and I know how to get things done.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: If you can be convinced that you cannot defeat Donald Trump will you stand down?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: (LAUGH)- It depends on‚Äì on if the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that I might do that.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well if‚Äì I mean on a more practical level The Washington Post just reported in the last hour that Senator Mark Warner is‚Äì is assembling a group of Senators together to try and convince you to stand down because they don‚Äôt think you can win.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well Mark is a good man. We‚Äôve never had (UNINTEL). He also tried to get the nomination too. Mark‚Äôs not‚Äì Mark and I have a different perspective. I respect him.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And if Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi come down and say ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre worried that if you stay in the race we‚Äôre gonna lose the House and the Senate‚Äù how will you respond?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äì I‚Äôd go into detail with them. I‚Äôve speaken (PH) to all of them in detail including Jim Clyburn every one of &#x27;em. They all said I should stay in the race‚Äì stay in the race. No one said‚Äì none of the people said I should leave.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But if they do?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well it‚Äôs like (LAUGH) they‚Äôre not gonna do that.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You‚Äôre sure?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well Yeah I‚Äôm sure. Look. I mean if the Lord Almighty came down and said ‚ÄúJoe get outta the race‚Äù I‚Äôd get outta the race. The Lord Almighty‚Äôs not comin‚Äô down. I mean these hypotheticals George if I mean it‚Äôs all‚Äì  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But‚Äì but it‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs not that hypothetical anymore. I‚Äì I‚Äì I‚Äì I grant that the‚Äì they have not k‚Äì requested a meeting but it‚Äôs been reported‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: But they‚Äì I met with them. I met with a lotta these people. I talk with them regularly. I had an hour conversation with Hakeem. I had more time (UNITEL)with Jim Clyburn. I spent time with many hours off and on in the last little bit with Chuck Schumer. It‚Äôs not like‚Äì I had all the governors‚Äì all the governors.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I agree that the Lord Almighty‚Äôs not gonna come down but if‚Äì if‚Äì if you are told reliably from your allies from your friends and supporters in the Democratic Party in the House and the Senate that they‚Äôre concerned you‚Äôre gonna lose the House and the Senate if you stay in what will you do?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôm not gonna answer that question. It‚Äôs not gonna happen.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: What‚Äôs your plan to turn the campaign around?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: You saw it today. How many‚Äì how many people draw crowds like I did today? Find me more enthusiastic than today? Huh?  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I mean have‚Äì I don‚Äôt think you wanna play the crowd game. Donald Trump can draw big crowds. There‚Äôs no question about that.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: He can draw a big crowd but what does he say? Who‚Äì who does he have? I‚Äôm the guy supposedly in trouble. We raised $38 million within four days after this. Over‚Äì we have over a million individual contributors individual contributors. That‚Äì that‚Äôs less than 200 bucks. We have‚Äì I mean I‚Äôm not seen what you‚Äôre‚Äì you‚Äôre proposing.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You haven‚Äôt seen the‚Äì the fall-off in the polls? You haven‚Äôt seen the reports of discontent in the Democratic Party House Democrats Senate Democrats?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôve seen it from the press.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You know I‚Äôve heard from dozens of your supporters over the last few days and a variety of views I grant you that. But the prevailing sentiment is this. They love you and they will be forever grateful to you for defeating Donald Trump in 2020.  They think you‚Äôve done a great job as President a lot of the successes you outlined. But they are worried about you and the country. And they don‚Äôt think you can win. They want you to go with grace and they will cheer you if you do. What do you say to that?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I say the vast majority are not where that‚Äì those folks are. I don‚Äôt doubt there are some folks there. Have you ever seen a group‚Äì ta‚Äì time when elected officials running for office aren‚Äôt little worried? Have you ever seen that? I‚Äôve not. Same thing happened in 2020. ‚ÄúOh Biden I don‚Äôt know. Man what‚Äôs he gonna do? He may bring me down he may (PH).‚Äù  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President I‚Äôve never seen a President 36% approval get reelected.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs my approval rating. That‚Äôs not what our polls show.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And if you stay in and Trump is elected and everything you‚Äôre warning about comes to pass how will you feel in January?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do that‚Äôs what this is about. Look George. Think of it this way. You‚Äôve heard me say this before. I think the United States and the world is at an inflection point when the things that happen in the next several years are gonna determine what the next six seven decades are gonna be like.  And who‚Äôs gonna be able to hold NATO together like me? Who‚Äôs gonna be able to be in a position where I‚Äôm able to keep the Pacific Basin in a position where we‚Äôre‚Äì we‚Äôre at least checkmating China now? Who‚Äôs gonna‚Äì who‚Äôs gonna do that? Who has that reach? Who has‚Äì who knows all these pe‚Ä¶? We‚Äôre gonna have I guess a good way to judge me is you‚Äôre gonna have now the NATO conference here in the United States next week. Come listen. See what they say.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President thanks for your time.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Thank you. Appreciate it.

25,Joe Biden,['president biden'  'house democrats'  'democracy'  'kamala harris'],ridenwithbiden,Read the letter President Biden sent to House Democrats telling them to support him in the election WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî President Joe Biden wants Democrats in Congress to know he has no intention of exiting this year‚Äôs election sending them a letter on Monday on his personal letterhead.  Here is Biden‚Äôs letter to the congressional Democrats whose backing he likely needs:  ‚ÄúFellow Democrats  Now that you have returned from the July 4th recess I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere I am firmly committed to staying in this race to running this race to the end and to beating Donald Trump.  I have had extensive conversations with the leadership of the party elected officials rank and file members and most importantly Democratic voters over these past 10 days or so. I have heard the concerns that people have ‚Äî their good faith fears and worries about what is at stake in this election. I am not blind to them. Believe me I know better than anyone the responsibility and the burden the nominee of our party carries. I carried it in 2020 when the fate of our nation was at stake. I also know these concerns come from a place of real respect for my lifetime of public service and my record as President and I have been moved by the expressions of affection for me from so many who have known me well and supported me over the course of my public life. I‚Äôve been grateful for the rock-solid steadfast support from so many elected Democrats in Congress and all across the country and taken great strength from the resolve and determination I‚Äôve seen from so many voters and grassroots supporters even in the hardest of weeks.  I can respond to all this by saying clearly and unequivocally: I wouldn‚Äôt be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024.  We had a Democratic nomination process and the voters have spoken clearly and decisively. I received over 14 million votes 87% of the votes cast across the entire nominating process. I have nearly 3000 delegates making me the presumptive nominee of our party by a wide margin.  This was a process open to anyone who wanted to run. Only three people chose to challenge me. One fared so badly that he left the primaries to run as an independent. Another attacked me for being too old and was soundly defeated. The voters of the Democratic Party have voted. They have chosen me to be the nominee of the party.  Do we now just say this process didn‚Äôt matter? That the voters don‚Äôt have a say?  I decline to do that. I feel a deep obligation to the faith and the trust the voters of the Democratic Party have placed in me to run this year. It was their decision to make. Not the press not the pundits not the big donors not any selected group of individuals no matter how well intentioned. The voters ‚Äî and the voters alone ‚Äî decide the nominee of the Democratic Party. How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party? I cannot do that. I will not do that.  I have no doubt that I ‚Äî and we ‚Äî can and will beat Donald Trump. We have an historic record of success to run on. From creating over 15 million jobs (including 200000 just last month) reaching historic lows on unemployment to revitalizing American manufacturing with 800000 jobs to protecting and expanding affordable health care to rebuilding America‚Äôs roads bridges highways ports and airports and water systems to beating Big Pharma and lowering the cost of prescription drugs including $35 a month insulin for seniors to providing student debt relief for nearly 5 million Americans to an historic investment in combatting climate change.  More importantly we have an economic vision to run on that soundly beats Trump and the MAGA Republicans. They are siding with the wealthy and the big corporations and we are siding with the working people of America. It wasn‚Äôt an isolated moment for Trump to stand at Mar-A-Lago and tell the oil industry they should give him $1 billion and he will do whatever they want.  That‚Äôs whose side Trump and the MAGA Republicans are on. Trump and the MAGA Republicans want another $5 trillion in tax cuts for rich people so they can cut Social Security and Medicare. We will never let that happen. Its trickle-down economics on steroids. We know the way to build the economy is from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down. We are finally going to make the rich and big corporations pay their fair share of taxes in this country. The MAGA party is also still determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act which could throw 45 million Americans off their coverage. We will never let that happen either. Trump got rich denying rental housing to Black people. We have a plan to build 2 million new housing units in America. They want to let Big Pharma charge as much as they want again. What do you think America‚Äôs seniors will think when they know Trump and the MAGA Republicans want to take away their $35 insulin ‚Äî as well as the $2000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription costs we Democrats just got them? Or what do you think American families are going to think when they find out Trump and the MAGA Republicans want to hit them with a new $2500 national sales tax on all the imported products they buy.  We are the ones lowering costs for families ‚Äî from health care to prescription drugs to student debt to housing. We are the ones protecting Social Security and Medicare. Everything they‚Äôre proposing raises costs for most Americans ‚Äî except their tax cuts which will go to the rich.  We are protecting the freedoms of Americans. Trump and the MAGA Republicans are taking them away. They have already for the first time in history taken away a fundamental freedom from the American people by overturning Roe v. Wade. They have decided politicians should make the most personal of decisions that should be made by women and their doctors and those closest to them. They have already said they won‚Äôt stop there ‚Äî and are going after everything from contraception to IVF to the right to marry who you love. And they have made it clear they will ban abortion nationwide. We will let none of that happen. I have made it clear that if Kamala and I are reelected and the nation elects a Democratic House and Senate we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. We are the ones who will bring real Supreme Court reform; Donald Trump and his majority want more of the same from the Court and the chance to add to the right-wing majority they built by subverting the norms and principles of the nomination and confirmation process.  And we are standing up for American democracy. After January 6th Trump has proven that he is unfit to ever hold the office of President. We can never allow him anywhere near that office again. And we never will.  My fellow Democrats ‚Äî we have the record the vision and the fundamental commitment to America‚Äôs freedoms and our Democracy to win.  The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it‚Äôs time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It is time to come together move forward as a unified party and defeat Donald Trump.‚Äù  Sincerely  Joe Biden  Joseph R.

2,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'usa'  'politics'],2blogr02blog,Here‚Äôs the thing that American liberals right now aren‚Äôt dealing with.   They say Joe Biden is better than Donald Trump - True (though they overstate the degree IMO)  They say that Trump is an embodiment of an anti-democratic tide of global fascism that will cause untold horrific suffering if empowered more - True  However here‚Äôs something that is also true that they don‚Äôt say: Joe Biden and the Democrats have no viable plan to deal with Trump the radicalization of the right and the global tide of fascism.   Their current plan is to hope that a Republican simply never wins an election ever again while doing nothing to change the underlying conditions that made the republican party like this.  I live in a solid blue state but I‚Äôll go vote for down-ballot local elections and while I‚Äôm there I‚Äôll probably bring myself to vote for Mr. Genocide Joe. But don‚Äôt kid yourself. The difference between a Trump Presidency part 2 and a Biden one is quite big in the short term on several key issues. But unless the Democrats come up with a viable plan to change the underlying factors all it can do at best is push out the inevitable fascistic collapse in this country by a couple years.,2024-07-08 17:00:50 GMT
6,Joe Biden,['election 2024'  'biden harris 2024'  'us politics'],lunadove,Honestly I do think we need to see how normalized Trump‚Äôs behavior has been to our country.  Biden had one bad debate performance and every single day since there have been waves of articles asking if Biden should step down.  Trump keeps getting basic facts mixed up (like the fact he‚Äôs running against Biden not Obama) lies constantly tried to overthrow the 2020 election had govt docs in Mar-A-Largo‚Äôs bathroom and Project 2025 has horrific consequences for the country.  And yet‚Ä¶nothing. I‚Äôve seen more articles wondering if Biden should step down due to a bad debate than articles about Project 2025.   The unspoken idea is that Biden is the adult in the room Trump can‚Äôt be reasoned with so if anything can be done to prevent a lot of people‚Äôs rights being taken away it‚Äôs on Biden and the Dems.   Which then gives people the impression that Biden and Trump are candidates on equal ground. Which they aren‚Äôt. The bar is on the floor for Trump.   Look how much pushback Biden got for a bad debate performance. We‚Äôre getting swamped with articles about how he should step down. Look how much pushback Trump is getting for any of the actions I listed above. No articles are coming out for him to step down bc everyone‚Äôs decided he can‚Äôt be reasoned with.  Honestly just please remember this if you‚Äôre thinking about not voting this Nov. The candidates are not equal elections have consequences and assuming that we‚Äôll have the same outcome if Biden gets elected or if Trump gets elected is due to a massive gaslighting campaign on the American people.,2024-07-08 16:48:51 GMT

Not Commander &amp; Chief Trump claimed he was going to build a wall along our southern border to protect our country. This wall would be paid for by Mexico as well. False &amp; false.  Trump started building a wall with funds from US taxpayers and shifting money from other government programs. Including military programs. Mexico paid not one cent towards the wall that is still incomplete to this day. Now Trump wants to blame democrats for a crisis at the border after he contacted his fellow republican members and instructed them to halt a bill that republicans created to help solve the problem once and for all. Because it would be another victory for Joe Biden and Trump wanted to run his campaign on the crisis at the border. So who‚Äôs to blame for the crisis at the border Donald?        Trump said he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with a better healthcare system known as Trumpcare. False &amp; false.  After insulting John McCain time and time again. Donald Trump needed his fellow republicans to seal a repeal of Obamacare. A sick and weakened John McCain came back to Washington to show that Donald Trump is not a leader and voted to keep Americans insured with Obamacare. Furthermore to this day not one person has seen the supposed replacement known as Trumpcare.        Trump said he‚Äôd drain the swamp. That all his wealthy friends would dislike him because of the taxes he‚Äôd place upon them. False &amp; false.  Trump enabled the wealthy to become even more wealthier by cutting theirs‚Äô and his taxes. The wealthy pay less than the middle class in the United States. Thanks in part to Donald Trump.,2024-07-08 16:40:36 GMT

0,Joe Biden,['democrats'  'debate'  'president'  'constitution'  '25th amendment'  '2024 presidential election'],anthonybialy,No Debate About Joe Biden‚Äôs Lucidity Joe Biden is unfit to be president. Wait: I just saw the debate. That‚Äôs even worse. It‚Äôs a good thing the position is part-time or we‚Äôd be doomed. The temp job he staffs doesn‚Äôt require him to be prepared or energetic so there‚Äôs no need to fret about news breaking while waiting for dinner.  Someone in his ninth decade who‚Äôs always been a numbskull insists he can keep a job where work responsibilities can occur in any time zone. The technical commander-in-chief might need to deal with Kim Jong Un taking the parking brake off their nukes during North Korean business hours which might interrupt Joe Bide Un‚Äôs Woody Woodpecker time. The choice between a half-declined inveterate liar or a fully-declined one will make November even more fun than now.  What time is the meeting to establish if dropping out should be official? That‚Äôll determine whether they have to deal with Doctor Jekyll or Mister Bide. Dissolving the special energy vitamin in his chocolate milk is just another thankless task for the administration‚Äôs flunkies. You never praised them for making gasoline slightly cheaper than the mysteriously astronomical rate last summer under whoever headed the state then.  Biden‚Äôs cogency is like an eclipse: you appreciate it more because it‚Äôs rare. The only factor mitigating slumping is that he was sliding at the start. Anyone who endured him speaking at any time while he was vice president or senator knows cognitive deterioration began far before his oatmeal brain started leaking.  Friends and family must care about Grampy Joey if they want him to keep working. But cynics suspect close grifters may be motivated by more than having their beloved relative continue to feel purpose. Democrats think everyone else is a conniving schemer too.  Doctor Jill Biden violates the Hippocratic Oath with stubborn elder abuse. It‚Äôs tough to focus on medical ethics as a mob wife. The crime family needs their meal ticket to keep the title even if he isn‚Äôt technically doing anything presidential. For Democrats the claim is all it takes. Biden leads like Obamacare gave everyone awesome affordable insurance.  Life is worth whatever those in the compassionate faction conclude. From aborting the inconvenient to propping up a president who should be talking to a potted plant in a nursing home Democrats are consistent about how much they value others.  This White House‚Äôs sole skill is proving conspiracies true. If you‚Äôre a Democrat ticked that Biden stubbornly won‚Äôt retire despite his inability to perform complicated tasks like identifying himself without pointing to his name tag make sure you weren‚Äôt shrieking at Republicans a few weeks ago for noticing Biden needed to be led off the stage by his last manager.  Very fair journalists hope you forget like you‚Äôre the present president. Guardians of truth went from claiming Barack Obama guiding off Biden was a truther conspiracy to orchestrating scrambling for a replacement nominee faster than they went from claiming shutting down hairdressers for the sake of halting the virus was mandated for your own good to a voluntary wise suggestion.  Everything this addled president remembers he believes is based in pretending reality isn‚Äôt happening. The same media that lied about Hunter‚Äôs laptop the diverse mosaic that open borders would create how taking rights would keep you from getting sick and corporations discovering greed in 2021 claims Joe Biden‚Äôs rough debate was a one-off. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre honest this once.  The time to have a talk with Biden about not being president was in 1972. His cold‚Äôs primary symptom is getting everything wrong. He‚Äôs had it for over half a century. The incumbent came up with the notion of getting rich by printing more money before he forgot his career.  The 25th Amendment is just another they loathe. You may as well want to own an AR-15 while announcing why the government can‚Äôt prevent such. The genie‚Äôs wish always turns into a curse. As with inflation ruining the aforementioned cash handout scheme Biden‚Äôs party never learns to abandon quick fixes.  Pushy federal goons wanted a defiant president who refused to be constrained by niceties like waiting for Congress to pass a bill. Now the executive ordering specialist applies the same stubbornness to remaining sitting in his fancy swivel chair. Frankenstein whines about his monster.  Foes of vexing checks and balances have always wanted a king. Now he doesn‚Äôt have power and they still kvetch. A clandestine committee voting on one person‚Äôs alleged decisions is the closest Democrats get to democratic.  Wrestling fans enjoy pretend bouts despite knowing results are phony. Dispensing with the charade might work for a kayfabe presidency. Whoever‚Äôs really steering in the Oval Office while Biden sorts his Happy Meal toys might not be as effective as raising inflation despite best worst efforts. America‚Äôs best hope until 2029 is a country-ruining president who can‚Äôt complete his checklist anymore including writing it.  The figurative megalomaniacal understudy who performed the role for the election would act just as terribly. It‚Äôs ideas that matter which disappoints personality cults. The staff is already merely projecting goals based on estimating what the ostensible supervisor would want. The AI presidency is advanced considering the figurehead was born before color television.  The one-person branch is already being run by committee. Breaking yet another office rule is simultaneously dejecting and reassuring. Daft policies that could be churned out by algorithm show that idiocy is predictable even if the idiots change. Subtracting Biden‚Äôs regrettable personality would be the most pleasant part of his second try.  Why depose someone who can Velcro his own sneakers around midday? This term or the next wouldn‚Äôt change much upon conceding that the guy in charge isn‚Äôt. His mental meltdown offers the best chance to limit the damage he inflicts. The nation really lucked out.  Anyone honest is used to him being out of it. If it makes Democrats feel better Joe Biden was a nastily moronic failure when he could form words. He‚Äôs the lucky one: he doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs boss.,2024-07-08 16:00:23 GMT

3,Joe Biden,['jill biden'  'biden interview'  'biden intervention'  'campaign collapse'],grits-galraisedinthesouth,Full transcript of the ABC News exclusive interview with President Joe Biden.  120 DAYS TO ELECTION DAY  ABC‚Äôs George Stephanopoulos‚Äô exclusive interview with President Biden  July 5 2024 9:10 PM  One-on-one with President Biden: ABC News Exclusive  ABC‚Äôs George Stephanopoulos  President Joe Biden in his first television interview since his CNN debate with former President Donald Trump sat down with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos in Madison Wisconsin on Friday.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President thank you for doing this.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Thank you for having me.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let‚Äôs start with the debate. eh You and your team said have said you had a bad night. But your‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Sure did.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But your friend Nancy Pelosi actually framed the question that I think is on the minds of millions of Americans. Was this a bad episode or the sign of a more serious condition?  &lt;!-- more --&gt; PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: It was a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn‚Äôt listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and‚Äì and a bad night.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You know you say you were exhausted. And‚Äì and I know you‚Äôve said that before as well but you came‚Äì and you did have a tough month. But you came home from Europe about 11 or 12 days before the debate spent six days in Camp David. Why wasn‚Äôt that enough rest time enough recovery time?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Because I was sick. I was feeling terrible. Matter of fact the docs with me. I asked if they did a COVID test because they‚Äôre trying to figure out what was wrong. They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection you know a virus. I didn‚Äôt. I just had a really bad cold.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And‚Äì did you ever watch the debate afterwards?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don‚Äôt think I did no.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well what I‚Äôm try‚Äì what I want to get at is what were you experiencing as you were going through the debate? Did you know how badly it was going?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yeah look. The whole way I prepared nobody‚Äôs fault mine. Nobody‚Äôs fault but mine. I uh‚Äì I prepared what I usually would do sittin‚Äô down as I did come back with foreign leaders or National Security Council for explicit detail. And I realized‚Äìbout partway through that you know all‚Äì I get quoted the New York Times had me down at ten points before the debate nine now or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is what I looked at is that he also lied 28 times. I couldn‚Äôt‚Äì I mean the way the debate ran not‚Äì my fault no one else‚Äôs fault no one else‚Äôs fault.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But it seemed like you were having trouble from the first question in even before he spoke.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I just had a bad night. You‚Äôve had some bad interviews once in a while. I‚Äì I can‚Äôt remember any but I‚Äôm sure you did.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äôve had plenty. I guess the question of‚Äì the problem is here for a lot of Americans watching is you‚Äôve said going back to 2020 ‚ÄúWatch me‚Äù to people who are concerned about your age. And you know 50 million Americans watched that debate. It seemed to confirm fears they already had.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well look. After that debate I did ten major events in a row including until 2:00 in the morning after the debate. I did events in North Carolina. I did events in‚Äîin in Georgia did events like this today large crowds overwhelming response no‚Äì no‚Äì no slipping. And so I just had a bad night. I don‚Äôt know why.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And‚Äì how‚Äì how quickly did it‚Äì did it come to you that you were having that bad night?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well it came to me I was havin‚Äô a bad night when I realized that even when I was answering a question even though they turned his mic off he was still shouting. And I‚Äì I let it distract me. I‚Äì I‚Äôm not blaming it on that but I realized that I just wasn‚Äôt in control.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Part of the other concern is that‚Äì this seems to fit into a pattern of decline that has been reported on recently. New York Times had a headline on July 2nd ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs lapses are said to be increasingly common and worrisome.‚Äù Here‚Äôs what they wrote.  ‚ÄúPeople who‚Äôve spent time with President Biden over the last few months or so said the lapses appear to have grown more frequent more pronounced and after Thursday d‚Äì Thursday‚Äôs debate more worrisome. By many accounts as evidenced by video footage observation and interviews Mr. Biden is not the same today as he was even when he took office three-and-a-half years ago.‚Äù Similar reporting in The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. Are you the same man today that you were when you took office three-and-a-half years ago?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: In terms of successes yes. I also was the guy who put together a peace plan for the Middle East that may be comin‚Äô to fruition. I was also the guy that expanded NATO. I was also the guy that grew the economy. All the individual things that were done were ideas I had or I fulfilled. I moved on.  And so for example you know ‚ÄúWe-Well that was true then what‚Äôs Biden done lately?‚Äù Di-you-just just see today just announced 200000 new jobs. We‚Äôre movin‚Äô in the direction that no one‚Äôs ever taken on. I know you know this from days in‚Äì in‚Äì in the‚Äì in the government.  I took on big pharma. I beat them. No one said I could beat them. I took on all the things we said we got done were told we couldn‚Äôt get done. And part of it is what I said when I ran was I wanted to do three things: Restore some decency to the office restore some support for the middle class instead of trickle down economics both from the middle out and the bottom up the way the wealthy still do fine everyone does better and unite the country.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But what has all that work over the last three-and-a-half years cost you physically mentally emotionally?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I‚Äì I‚Äì I just think it cost me a really bad night bad run but you know I‚Äì George. I have‚Äì I‚Äôm optimistic about this country. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre a country of losers that he points out. I don‚Äôt think America‚Äôs in tough shape. I think America is on the cusp of breaking through in so many incredible opportunities.  In this next term I‚Äôm gonna make sure we gotta‚Äì straighten out the tax system. I‚Äôm gonna make sure we‚Äôre in a situation where we have healthcare for all people where we‚Äôre in a position where we have‚Äì have childcare and eldercare free up‚Äì and all these things.  One thing I‚Äôm proudest of is remember when my economic plan was put forward? A lot of the mainstream economists said ‚ÄúThis is not gonna work.‚Äù Guess what? We now have 16 Nobel laureates 16 of ‚Äòem in economics saying that ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs next term would be a sig‚Äì enor‚Äì based on what he wants to do enormous success.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs plan would cause a recession and sig-nif‚Äì gi‚Äì increase inflation. I‚Äôve made great progress and that‚Äôs what I plan on doin‚Äô. And we can do this.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äì I‚Äì I understand that and I‚Äôm not disputing that. What I‚Äôm asking you is‚Äì about your personal situation. Do you dispute that there have been more lapses especially in the last several months?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Can I run the 100 in 10 flat? No. But I‚Äôm still in good shape.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Are you more frail?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: No.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Come keep my schedule. (LAUGH)  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you spoke with your doctor after the debate. What did he say?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: He said he‚Äì just looked at me and said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exhausted.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. I have medical doctors travel with me everywhere. Every President does as you know. Medical doctors some of the best in the world travel with me everywhere I go. I have an ongoing assessment of what I‚Äôm doin‚Äô and they don‚Äôt hesitate to tell me if they think there‚Äôs something wrong.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you said you have an ongoing assessment. Have you had a full neurological and cognitive evaluation?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôve had‚Äì I get a full neurological test everyday with me. And I‚Äôve had a full physical. I had you know I mean I‚Äì I‚Äôve been at Walter Reed for my physicals. I mean‚Äìuhm yes the answer.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äì I know your doctor said he consulted with a neurologist. I‚Äì I guess I‚Äôm asking‚Äì a slightly different question. Have you had the specific cognitive tests and have you had a neurologist a specialist do an examination?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: No. No one said I had to. No one said. They said I‚Äôm good.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Would you be willing to undergo an independent medical evaluation that included neurological and cognit‚Äì cognitive tests and release the results to the American people?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Look. I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test. Everything I do. You know not only am I campaigning but I‚Äôm running the world. Not‚Äì and that‚Äôs not hi‚Äì sounds like hyperbole but we are the essential nation of the world..  Madeleine Albright was right. And every single day for example today before I came out here I‚Äôm on the phone with‚Äì with the prime minister of‚Äì well anyway I shouldn‚Äôt get into detail but with Netanyahu. I‚Äôm on the phone with the new prime minister of England.  I‚Äôm workin‚Äô on what we were doin‚Äô with regard to‚Äì in Europe with regard to expansion of NATO and whether it‚Äôs gonna stick. I‚Äôm takin‚Äô on Putin. I mean every day there‚Äôs no day I go through there not those decisions I have to make every single day.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And you have been doing that and the American people have been watching yet their concerns about your age and your health are growing. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking ‚Äì to reassure them would you be willing to have the independent medical evaluation?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Watch me between‚Äì there‚Äôs a lotta time left in this campaign. There‚Äôs over 125 days.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So the answer‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: They‚Äôll make a decision.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Right‚Äîthe answer right now is no you‚Äì you don‚Äôt want to do that right now.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I‚Äôve already done it.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You talked a lot about your successes in‚Äì at the beginning of this interview. And‚Äì and I don‚Äôt want to dispute that I don‚Äôt want to debate that. But‚Äì as you know elections are about the future not the past. They‚Äôre about tomorrow not yesterday. And the question on so many people‚Äôs minds right now is ‚ÄúCan you serve effectively for the next four years?‚Äù  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: George. I‚Äôm the guy that put NATO together the future. No one thought I could expand it. I‚Äôm the guy that shut Putin down. No one thought could happen. I‚Äôm the guy that put together a South Pacific initiative with AUKUS. I‚Äôm the guy that got 50 nations out‚Äì not only in Europe outside of Europe as well to help Ukraine.  I‚Äôm the guy that got Japanese to expand their budget. I‚Äôm the‚Äì so I mean these‚Äì and for example when I decided we used to have 40% of computer chips. We invented the chip the little chip the computer chip. It‚Äôs in everything from cell phone to weapons.  And so we used to have 40% and we‚Äôre down to virtually nothing. So I get in the plane against the advice of everybody and I fly to South Korea. I convince them to invest in the United States billions of dollars. Now we have tens of billions of dollars being invested in the United States making us back in a position we‚Äôre gonna own that industry again. We have I mean I‚Äì I just‚Äì anyway. I‚Äôm‚Äì I don‚Äôt wanna take too much credit. I have a great staff.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But hold on. My‚Äì I guess my point is all that takes a toll. Do you have the mental and physical capacity to do it for another four years?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I believes so I wouldn‚Äôt be runnin‚Äô if I didn‚Äôt think I did. Look I‚Äôm runnin‚Äô again because I think I understand best what has to be done to take this nation to a completely new new level. We‚Äôre on our way. We‚Äôre on our way. And look. The decision recently made by the Supreme Court on immunity you know the next President of the United States it‚Äôs not just about whether he or she knows what they‚Äôre doin‚Äô.  It‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs not‚Äì not about a con‚Äì a conglomerate of people making decisions. It‚Äôs about the character of the President. The character of the President‚Äôs gonna determine whether or not this Constitution is employed the right way.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you a tougher more personal question. Are you sure you‚Äôre being honest with yourself when you say you have the mental and physical capacity to serve another four years?  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you a tougher more personal question. Are you sure you‚Äôre being honest with yourself when you say you have the mental and physical capacity to serve another four years?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yes I am because George the last thing I want to do is not be able to meet that. I think as some of senior economist and senior foreign policy specialists say if I stop now I‚Äôd go down in history as a pretty successful President. No one thought I could get done what we got done.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But are you being with honest‚Äì with yourself as well about your ability to defeat Donald Trump right now?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Yes. Yes yes yes.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You say that and let me challenge you.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Sure.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Because you were close but behind going into the debate. You‚Äôre further behind now by‚Äì by any measure. It‚Äôs been a two-man race for several months. Inflation has come down. In those last few months he‚Äôs become a convicted felon. Yet you‚Äôre still falling further behind.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: You guys keep saying that. George do you‚Äì look you know polling better than anybody. Do you think polling data as accurate as it used to be?  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I don‚Äôt think so but I think when you look at all the polling data right now it shows that he‚Äôs certainly ahead in the popular vote probably even more ahead in the battleground states. And one of the other key factors there is it shows that in many of the battleground states the Democrats who are running for Senate and the House are doing better than you are.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That‚Äôs not unusual in some states. I carried an awful lotta Democrats last time I ran in 2020. Look I remember them tellin‚Äô me the same thing in 2020. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt win. The polls show I can‚Äôt win.‚Äù Remember 2024‚Äì 2020 the red wave was coming.  Before the vote I said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not gonna happen. We‚Äôre gonna win.‚Äù We did better in an off-year than almost any incumbent President ever has done. They said in 2023 (STATIC) all the tough (UNINTEL) we‚Äôre not gonna win. I went into all those areas and all those‚Äì all those districts and we won.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: All that is true but 2020 was a close race. And your approval rating has dropped significantly since then. I think the last poll I saw was at about 36%.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Woah woah woah  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: The number of Americans who think you‚Äôre too old to serve has doubled since 2020. Wouldn‚Äôt a clear-eyed political calculus tell you that it‚Äôs gonna be much tougher to win in 2024?.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Not when you‚Äôre running against a pathological liar. Not when he hadn‚Äôt been challenged in a way that he‚Äôs about to be challenged. Not when people‚Äì  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You‚Äôve had months to challenge him.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Oh sure I had months but I was also doin‚Äô a hell of a lot of other things like wars around the world like keeping NATO together like working‚Äì anyway. But look.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you really believe you‚Äôre not behind right now?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I think it‚Äôs in‚Äì all the pollsters I talk to tell me it‚Äôs a tossup. It‚Äôs a tossup. And when I‚Äôm behind there‚Äôs only one poll I‚Äôm really far behind CBS Poll and NBC I mean excuse me. And‚Äì uh‚Äì  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: New York‚Äì New York Times and NBC both have‚Äì have you about six points behind in the popular vote.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That‚Äôs exactly right. New York Times had me behind before anything having to do with this race‚Äì had me hind‚Äì behind ten points. Ten points they had me behind. Nothing‚Äôs changed substantially since the debate in the New York Times poll.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Just when you look at the reality though Mr. President I mean you won the popular vote‚Äì in‚Äì in 2020 but it was still deadly close in the electoral college‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: By 7 million votes.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. But you‚Äôre behind now in the popular vote.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don‚Äôt‚Äì I don‚Äôt buy that.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Is it worth the risk?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don‚Äôt think anybody‚Äôs more qualified to be President or win this race than me.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You know the heart of your case against Donald Trump is that he‚Äôs only out for himself putting his personal interests ahead of the national interest. How do you respond to critics who say that by staying in the race you‚Äôre doing the same thing?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Oh come on. Well I don‚Äôt think those critics know what they‚Äôre talkin‚Äô about.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: They‚Äôre just wrong?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: They‚Äôre just wrong. Look Trump is a pathological liar. Trump is‚Äì he is‚Äì you ever seen anything Trump did that benefited sa‚Äì somebody else and not him? You can‚Äôt answer I know.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I‚Äôve‚Äì I‚Äôve questioned him and his allies as persistently as any journalist has.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Oh I know you have. I‚Äôm not being critical. I‚Äôm not being critical but look I mean the man is a congenital liar. As I said they pointed out in that debate he lied 27‚Äì 28 times‚Äì times whatever number over 20 times. Talk about how good his economy was how he brought down inflation how‚Äì this is a guy who unlike‚Äì only other President oth‚Äì other than him is Hoover who lost more jobs than he created.  This is a guy who told us to put bleach in our arms to deal with COVID with a million‚Äì over a million people died. This is a guy who talks about wantin‚Äô to get rid of the healthcare provision we put in place. This is a guy who wants to give the power back to big pharma to be able to charge exorbitant prices for drugs. This is a guy who wants to undo every single thing I‚Äôve done every single‚Äì every single thing.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I understand that. I understand that‚Äôs why you want to stay in the race but have you convinced yourself that only you can defeat him?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I convinced myself of two things. I‚Äôm the most qualified person to beat him and I know how to get things done.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: If you can be convinced that you cannot defeat Donald Trump will you stand down?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: (LAUGH)- It depends on‚Äì on if the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that I might do that.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well if‚Äì I mean on a more practical level The Washington Post just reported in the last hour that Senator Mark Warner is‚Äì is assembling a group of Senators together to try and convince you to stand down because they don‚Äôt think you can win.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well Mark is a good man. We‚Äôve never had (UNINTEL). He also tried to get the nomination too. Mark‚Äôs not‚Äì Mark and I have a different perspective. I respect him.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And if Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi come down and say ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre worried that if you stay in the race we‚Äôre gonna lose the House and the Senate‚Äù how will you respond?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äì I‚Äôd go into detail with them. I‚Äôve speaken (PH) to all of them in detail including Jim Clyburn every one of &#x27;em. They all said I should stay in the race‚Äì stay in the race. No one said‚Äì none of the people said I should leave.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But if they do?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well it‚Äôs like (LAUGH) they‚Äôre not gonna do that.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You‚Äôre sure?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well Yeah I‚Äôm sure. Look. I mean if the Lord Almighty came down and said ‚ÄúJoe get outta the race‚Äù I‚Äôd get outta the race. The Lord Almighty‚Äôs not comin‚Äô down. I mean these hypotheticals George if I mean it‚Äôs all‚Äì  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But‚Äì but it‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs‚Äì it‚Äôs not that hypothetical anymore. I‚Äì I‚Äì I‚Äì I grant that the‚Äì they have not k‚Äì requested a meeting but it‚Äôs been reported‚Äì  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: But they‚Äì I met with them. I met with a lotta these people. I talk with them regularly. I had an hour conversation with Hakeem. I had more time (UNITEL)with Jim Clyburn. I spent time with many hours off and on in the last little bit with Chuck Schumer. It‚Äôs not like‚Äì I had all the governors‚Äì all the governors.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I agree that the Lord Almighty‚Äôs not gonna come down but if‚Äì if‚Äì if you are told reliably from your allies from your friends and supporters in the Democratic Party in the House and the Senate that they‚Äôre concerned you‚Äôre gonna lose the House and the Senate if you stay in what will you do?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôm not gonna answer that question. It‚Äôs not gonna happen.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: What‚Äôs your plan to turn the campaign around?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: You saw it today. How many‚Äì how many people draw crowds like I did today? Find me more enthusiastic than today? Huh?  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I mean have‚Äì I don‚Äôt think you wanna play the crowd game. Donald Trump can draw big crowds. There‚Äôs no question about that.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: He can draw a big crowd but what does he say? Who‚Äì who does he have? I‚Äôm the guy supposedly in trouble. We raised $38 million within four days after this. Over‚Äì we have over a million individual contributors individual contributors. That‚Äì that‚Äôs less than 200 bucks. We have‚Äì I mean I‚Äôm not seen what you‚Äôre‚Äì you‚Äôre proposing.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You haven‚Äôt seen the‚Äì the fall-off in the polls? You haven‚Äôt seen the reports of discontent in the Democratic Party House Democrats Senate Democrats?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôve seen it from the press.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You know I‚Äôve heard from dozens of your supporters over the last few days and a variety of views I grant you that. But the prevailing sentiment is this. They love you and they will be forever grateful to you for defeating Donald Trump in 2020.  They think you‚Äôve done a great job as President a lot of the successes you outlined. But they are worried about you and the country. And they don‚Äôt think you can win. They want you to go with grace and they will cheer you if you do. What do you say to that?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I say the vast majority are not where that‚Äì those folks are. I don‚Äôt doubt there are some folks there. Have you ever seen a group‚Äì ta‚Äì time when elected officials running for office aren‚Äôt little worried? Have you ever seen that? I‚Äôve not. Same thing happened in 2020. ‚ÄúOh Biden I don‚Äôt know. Man what‚Äôs he gonna do? He may bring me down he may (PH).‚Äù  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President I‚Äôve never seen a President 36% approval get reelected.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs my approval rating. That‚Äôs not what our polls show.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And if you stay in and Trump is elected and everything you‚Äôre warning about comes to pass how will you feel in January?  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I‚Äôll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do that‚Äôs what this is about. Look George. Think of it this way. You‚Äôve heard me say this before. I think the United States and the world is at an inflection point when the things that happen in the next several years are gonna determine what the next six seven decades are gonna be like.  And who‚Äôs gonna be able to hold NATO together like me? Who‚Äôs gonna be able to be in a position where I‚Äôm able to keep the Pacific Basin in a position where we‚Äôre‚Äì we‚Äôre at least checkmating China now? Who‚Äôs gonna‚Äì who‚Äôs gonna do that? Who has that reach? Who has‚Äì who knows all these pe‚Ä¶? We‚Äôre gonna have I guess a good way to judge me is you‚Äôre gonna have now the NATO conference here in the United States next week. Come listen. See what they say.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President thanks for your time.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Thank you. Appreciate it.

25,Joe Biden,['president biden'  'house democrats'  'democracy'  'kamala harris'],ridenwithbiden,Read the letter President Biden sent to House Democrats telling them to support him in the election WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî President Joe Biden wants Democrats in Congress to know he has no intention of exiting this year‚Äôs election sending them a letter on Monday on his personal letterhead.  Here is Biden‚Äôs letter to the congressional Democrats whose backing he likely needs:  ‚ÄúFellow Democrats  Now that you have returned from the July 4th recess I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere I am firmly committed to staying in this race to running this race to the end and to beating Donald Trump.  I have had extensive conversations with the leadership of the party elected officials rank and file members and most importantly Democratic voters over these past 10 days or so. I have heard the concerns that people have ‚Äî their good faith fears and worries about what is at stake in this election. I am not blind to them. Believe me I know better than anyone the responsibility and the burden the nominee of our party carries. I carried it in 2020 when the fate of our nation was at stake. I also know these concerns come from a place of real respect for my lifetime of public service and my record as President and I have been moved by the expressions of affection for me from so many who have known me well and supported me over the course of my public life. I‚Äôve been grateful for the rock-solid steadfast support from so many elected Democrats in Congress and all across the country and taken great strength from the resolve and determination I‚Äôve seen from so many voters and grassroots supporters even in the hardest of weeks.  I can respond to all this by saying clearly and unequivocally: I wouldn‚Äôt be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024.  We had a Democratic nomination process and the voters have spoken clearly and decisively. I received over 14 million votes 87% of the votes cast across the entire nominating process. I have nearly 3000 delegates making me the presumptive nominee of our party by a wide margin.  This was a process open to anyone who wanted to run. Only three people chose to challenge me. One fared so badly that he left the primaries to run as an independent. Another attacked me for being too old and was soundly defeated. The voters of the Democratic Party have voted. They have chosen me to be the nominee of the party.  Do we now just say this process didn‚Äôt matter? That the voters don‚Äôt have a say?  I decline to do that. I feel a deep obligation to the faith and the trust the voters of the Democratic Party have placed in me to run this year. It was their decision to make. Not the press not the pundits not the big donors not any selected group of individuals no matter how well intentioned. The voters ‚Äî and the voters alone ‚Äî decide the nominee of the Democratic Party. How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party? I cannot do that. I will not do that.  I have no doubt that I ‚Äî and we ‚Äî can and will beat Donald Trump. We have an historic record of success to run on. From creating over 15 million jobs (including 200000 just last month) reaching historic lows on unemployment to revitalizing American manufacturing with 800000 jobs to protecting and expanding affordable health care to rebuilding America‚Äôs roads bridges highways ports and airports and water systems to beating Big Pharma and lowering the cost of prescription drugs including $35 a month insulin for seniors to providing student debt relief for nearly 5 million Americans to an historic investment in combatting climate change.  More importantly we have an economic vision to run on that soundly beats Trump and the MAGA Republicans. They are siding with the wealthy and the big corporations and we are siding with the working people of America. It wasn‚Äôt an isolated moment for Trump to stand at Mar-A-Lago and tell the oil industry they should give him $1 billion and he will do whatever they want.  That‚Äôs whose side Trump and the MAGA Republicans are on. Trump and the MAGA Republicans want another $5 trillion in tax cuts for rich people so they can cut Social Security and Medicare. We will never let that happen. Its trickle-down economics on steroids. We know the way to build the economy is from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down. We are finally going to make the rich and big corporations pay their fair share of taxes in this country. The MAGA party is also still determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act which could throw 45 million Americans off their coverage. We will never let that happen either. Trump got rich denying rental housing to Black people. We have a plan to build 2 million new housing units in America. They want to let Big Pharma charge as much as they want again. What do you think America‚Äôs seniors will think when they know Trump and the MAGA Republicans want to take away their $35 insulin ‚Äî as well as the $2000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription costs we Democrats just got them? Or what do you think American families are going to think when they find out Trump and the MAGA Republicans want to hit them with a new $2500 national sales tax on all the imported products they buy.  We are the ones lowering costs for families ‚Äî from health care to prescription drugs to student debt to housing. We are the ones protecting Social Security and Medicare. Everything they‚Äôre proposing raises costs for most Americans ‚Äî except their tax cuts which will go to the rich.  We are protecting the freedoms of Americans. Trump and the MAGA Republicans are taking them away. They have already for the first time in history taken away a fundamental freedom from the American people by overturning Roe v. Wade. They have decided politicians should make the most personal of decisions that should be made by women and their doctors and those closest to them. They have already said they won‚Äôt stop there ‚Äî and are going after everything from contraception to IVF to the right to marry who you love. And they have made it clear they will ban abortion nationwide. We will let none of that happen. I have made it clear that if Kamala and I are reelected and the nation elects a Democratic House and Senate we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. We are the ones who will bring real Supreme Court reform; Donald Trump and his majority want more of the same from the Court and the chance to add to the right-wing majority they built by subverting the norms and principles of the nomination and confirmation process.  And we are standing up for American democracy. After January 6th Trump has proven that he is unfit to ever hold the office of President. We can never allow him anywhere near that office again. And we never will.  My fellow Democrats ‚Äî we have the record the vision and the fundamental commitment to America‚Äôs freedoms and our Democracy to win.  The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it‚Äôs time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It is time to come together move forward as a unified party and defeat Donald Trump.‚Äù  Sincerely  Joe Biden  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  President of the United States of America  July 8 2024|Updated July 8 2024 11:48 a.m.,2024-07-08 17:03:27 GMT
2,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'usa'  'politics'],2blogr02blog,Here‚Äôs the thing that American liberals right now aren‚Äôt dealing with.   They say Joe Biden is better than Donald Trump - True (though they overstate the degree IMO)  They say that Trump is an embodiment of an anti-democratic tide of global fascism that will cause untold horrific suffering if empowered more - True  However here‚Äôs something that is also true that they don‚Äôt say: Joe Biden and the Democrats have no viable plan to deal with Trump the radicalization of the right and the global tide of fascism.   Their current plan is to hope that a Republican simply never wins an election ever again while doing nothing to change the underlying conditions that made the republican party like this.  I live in a solid blue state but I‚Äôll go vote for down-ballot local elections and while I‚Äôm there I‚Äôll probably bring myself to vote for Mr. Genocide Joe. But don‚Äôt kid yourself. The difference between a Trump Presidency part 2 and a Biden one is quite big in the short term on several key issues. But unless the Democrats come up with a viable plan to change the underlying factors all it can do at best is push out the inevitable fascistic collapse in this country by a couple years.,2024-07-08 17:00:50 GMT
6,Joe Biden,['election 2024'  'biden harris 2024'  'us politics'],lunadove,Honestly I do think we need to see how normalized Trump‚Äôs behavior has been to our country.  Biden had one bad debate performance and every single day since there have been waves of articles asking if Biden should step down.  Trump keeps getting basic facts mixed up (like the fact he‚Äôs running against Biden not Obama) lies constantly tried to overthrow the 2020 election had govt docs in Mar-A-Largo‚Äôs bathroom and Project 2025 has horrific consequences for the country.  And yet‚Ä¶nothing. I‚Äôve seen more articles wondering if Biden should step down due to a bad debate than articles about Project 2025.   The unspoken idea is that Biden is the adult in the room Trump can‚Äôt be reasoned with so if anything can be done to prevent a lot of people‚Äôs rights being taken away it‚Äôs on Biden and the Dems.   Which then gives people the impression that Biden and Trump are candidates on equal ground. Which they aren‚Äôt. The bar is on the floor for Trump.   Look how much pushback Biden got for a bad debate performance. We‚Äôre getting swamped with articles about how he should step down. Look how much pushback Trump is getting for any of the actions I listed above. No articles are coming out for him to step down bc everyone‚Äôs decided he can‚Äôt be reasoned with.  Honestly just please remember this if you‚Äôre thinking about not voting this Nov. The candidates are not equal elections have consequences and assuming that we‚Äôll have the same outcome if Biden gets elected or if Trump gets elected is due to a massive gaslighting campaign on the American people.,2024-07-08 16:48:51 GMT

Not Commander &amp; Chief Trump claimed he was going to build a wall along our southern border to protect our country. This wall would be paid for by Mexico as well. False &amp; false.  Trump started building a wall with funds from US taxpayers and shifting money from other government programs. Including military programs. Mexico paid not one cent towards the wall that is still incomplete to this day. Now Trump wants to blame democrats for a crisis at the border after he contacted his fellow republican members and instructed them to halt a bill that republicans created to help solve the problem once and for all. Because it would be another victory for Joe Biden and Trump wanted to run his campaign on the crisis at the border. So who‚Äôs to blame for the crisis at the border Donald?        Trump said he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with a better healthcare system known as Trumpcare. False &amp; false.  After insulting John McCain time and time again. Donald Trump needed his fellow republicans to seal a repeal of Obamacare. A sick and weakened John McCain came back to Washington to show that Donald Trump is not a leader and voted to keep Americans insured with Obamacare. Furthermore to this day not one person has seen the supposed replacement known as Trumpcare.        Trump said he‚Äôd drain the swamp. That all his wealthy friends would dislike him because of the taxes he‚Äôd place upon them. False &amp; false.  Trump enabled the wealthy to become even more wealthier by cutting theirs‚Äô and his taxes. The wealthy pay less than the middle class in the United States. Thanks in part to Donald Trump.,2024-07-08 16:40:36 GMT

0,Joe Biden,['democrats'  'debate'  'president'  'constitution'  '25th amendment'  '2024 presidential election'],anthonybialy,No Debate About Joe Biden‚Äôs Lucidity Joe Biden is unfit to be president. Wait: I just saw the debate. That‚Äôs even worse. It‚Äôs a good thing the position is part-time or we‚Äôd be doomed. The temp job he staffs doesn‚Äôt require him to be prepared or energetic so there‚Äôs no need to fret about news breaking while waiting for dinner.  Someone in his ninth decade who‚Äôs always been a numbskull insists he can keep a job where work responsibilities can occur in any time zone. The technical commander-in-chief might need to deal with Kim Jong Un taking the parking brake off their nukes during North Korean business hours which might interrupt Joe Bide Un‚Äôs Woody Woodpecker time. The choice between a half-declined inveterate liar or a fully-declined one will make November even more fun than now.  What time is the meeting to establish if dropping out should be official? That‚Äôll determine whether they have to deal with Doctor Jekyll or Mister Bide. Dissolving the special energy vitamin in his chocolate milk is just another thankless task for the administration‚Äôs flunkies. You never praised them for making gasoline slightly cheaper than the mysteriously astronomical rate last summer under whoever headed the state then.  Biden‚Äôs cogency is like an eclipse: you appreciate it more because it‚Äôs rare. The only factor mitigating slumping is that he was sliding at the start. Anyone who endured him speaking at any time while he was vice president or senator knows cognitive deterioration began far before his oatmeal brain started leaking.  Friends and family must care about Grampy Joey if they want him to keep working. But cynics suspect close grifters may be motivated by more than having their beloved relative continue to feel purpose. Democrats think everyone else is a conniving schemer too.  Doctor Jill Biden violates the Hippocratic Oath with stubborn elder abuse. It‚Äôs tough to focus on medical ethics as a mob wife. The crime family needs their meal ticket to keep the title even if he isn‚Äôt technically doing anything presidential. For Democrats the claim is all it takes. Biden leads like Obamacare gave everyone awesome affordable insurance.  Life is worth whatever those in the compassionate faction conclude. From aborting the inconvenient to propping up a president who should be talking to a potted plant in a nursing home Democrats are consistent about how much they value others.  This White House‚Äôs sole skill is proving conspiracies true. If you‚Äôre a Democrat ticked that Biden stubbornly won‚Äôt retire despite his inability to perform complicated tasks like identifying himself without pointing to his name tag make sure you weren‚Äôt shrieking at Republicans a few weeks ago for noticing Biden needed to be led off the stage by his last manager.  Very fair journalists hope you forget like you‚Äôre the present president. Guardians of truth went from claiming Barack Obama guiding off Biden was a truther conspiracy to orchestrating scrambling for a replacement nominee faster than they went from claiming shutting down hairdressers for the sake of halting the virus was mandated for your own good to a voluntary wise suggestion.  Everything this addled president remembers he believes is based in pretending reality isn‚Äôt happening. The same media that lied about Hunter‚Äôs laptop the diverse mosaic that open borders would create how taking rights would keep you from getting sick and corporations discovering greed in 2021 claims Joe Biden‚Äôs rough debate was a one-off. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre honest this once.  The time to have a talk with Biden about not being president was in 1972. His cold‚Äôs primary symptom is getting everything wrong. He‚Äôs had it for over half a century. The incumbent came up with the notion of getting rich by printing more money before he forgot his career.  The 25th Amendment is just another they loathe. You may as well want to own an AR-15 while announcing why the government can‚Äôt prevent such. The genie‚Äôs wish always turns into a curse. As with inflation ruining the aforementioned cash handout scheme Biden‚Äôs party never learns to abandon quick fixes.  Pushy federal goons wanted a defiant president who refused to be constrained by niceties like waiting for Congress to pass a bill. Now the executive ordering specialist applies the same stubbornness to remaining sitting in his fancy swivel chair. Frankenstein whines about his monster.  Foes of vexing checks and balances have always wanted a king. Now he doesn‚Äôt have power and they still kvetch. A clandestine committee voting on one person‚Äôs alleged decisions is the closest Democrats get to democratic.  Wrestling fans enjoy pretend bouts despite knowing results are phony. Dispensing with the charade might work for a kayfabe presidency. Whoever‚Äôs really steering in the Oval Office while Biden sorts his Happy Meal toys might not be as effective as raising inflation despite best worst efforts. America‚Äôs best hope until 2029 is a country-ruining president who can‚Äôt complete his checklist anymore including writing it.  The figurative megalomaniacal understudy who performed the role for the election would act just as terribly. It‚Äôs ideas that matter which disappoints personality cults. The staff is already merely projecting goals based on estimating what the ostensible supervisor would want. The AI presidency is advanced considering the figurehead was born before color television.  The one-person branch is already being run by committee. Breaking yet another office rule is simultaneously dejecting and reassuring. Daft policies that could be churned out by algorithm show that idiocy is predictable even if the idiots change. Subtracting Biden‚Äôs regrettable personality would be the most pleasant part of his second try.  Why depose someone who can Velcro his own sneakers around midday? This term or the next wouldn‚Äôt change much upon conceding that the guy in charge isn‚Äôt. His mental meltdown offers the best chance to limit the damage he inflicts. The nation really lucked out.  Anyone honest is used to him being out of it. If it makes Democrats feel better Joe Biden was a nastily moronic failure when he could form words. He‚Äôs the lucky one: he doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs boss.,2024-07-08 16:00:23 GMT

It wasn‚Äôt an isolated moment for Trump to stand at Mar-A-Lago and tell the oil industry they should give him $1 billion and he will do whatever they want.  That‚Äôs whose side Trump and the MAGA Republicans are on. Trump and the MAGA Republicans want another $5 trillion in tax cuts for rich people so they can cut Social Security and Medicare. We will never let that happen. Its trickle-down economics on steroids. We know the way to build the economy is from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down. We are finally going to make the rich and big corporations pay their fair share of taxes in this country. The MAGA party is also still determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act which could throw 45 million Americans off their coverage. We will never let that happen either. Trump got rich denying rental housing to Black people. We have a plan to build 2 million new housing units in America. They want to let Big Pharma charge as much as they want again. What do you think America‚Äôs seniors will think when they know Trump and the MAGA Republicans want to take away their $35 insulin ‚Äî as well as the $2000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription costs we Democrats just got them? Or what do you think American families are going to think when they find out Trump and the MAGA Republicans want to hit them with a new $2500 national sales tax on all the imported products they buy.  We are the ones lowering costs for families ‚Äî from health care to prescription drugs to student debt to housing. We are the ones protecting Social Security and Medicare. Everything they‚Äôre proposing raises costs for most Americans ‚Äî except their tax cuts which will go to the rich.  We are protecting the freedoms of Americans. Trump and the MAGA Republicans are taking them away. They have already for the first time in history taken away a fundamental freedom from the American people by overturning Roe v. Wade. They have decided politicians should make the most personal of decisions that should be made by women and their doctors and those closest to them. They have already said they won‚Äôt stop there ‚Äî and are going after everything from contraception to IVF to the right to marry who you love. And they have made it clear they will ban abortion nationwide. We will let none of that happen. I have made it clear that if Kamala and I are reelected and the nation elects a Democratic House and Senate we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. We are the ones who will bring real Supreme Court reform; Donald Trump and his majority want more of the same from the Court and the chance to add to the right-wing majority they built by subverting the norms and principles of the nomination and confirmation process.  And we are standing up for American democracy. After January 6th Trump has proven that he is unfit to ever hold the office of President. We can never allow him anywhere near that office again. And we never will.  My fellow Democrats ‚Äî we have the record the vision and the fundamental commitment to America‚Äôs freedoms and our Democracy to win.  The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it‚Äôs time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It is time to come together move forward as a unified party and defeat Donald Trump.‚Äù  Sincerely  Joe Biden  Joseph R.

2,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'usa'  'politics'],2blogr02blog,Here‚Äôs the thing that American liberals right now aren‚Äôt dealing with.   They say Joe Biden is better than Donald Trump - True (though they overstate the degree IMO)  They say that Trump is an embodiment of an anti-democratic tide of global fascism that will cause untold horrific suffering if empowered more - True  However here‚Äôs something that is also true that they don‚Äôt say: Joe Biden and the Democrats have no viable plan to deal with Trump the radicalization of the right and the global tide of fascism.   Their current plan is to hope that a Republican simply never wins an election ever again while doing nothing to change the underlying conditions that made the republican party like this.  I live in a solid blue state but I‚Äôll go vote for down-ballot local elections and while I‚Äôm there I‚Äôll probably bring myself to vote for Mr. Genocide Joe. But don‚Äôt kid yourself. The difference between a Trump Presidency part 2 and a Biden one is quite big in the short term on several key issues. But unless the Democrats come up with a viable plan to change the underlying factors all it can do at best is push out the inevitable fascistic collapse in this country by a couple years.,2024-07-08 17:00:50 GMT
6,Joe Biden,['election 2024'  'biden harris 2024'  'us politics'],lunadove,Honestly I do think we need to see how normalized Trump‚Äôs behavior has been to our country.  Biden had one bad debate performance and every single day since there have been waves of articles asking if Biden should step down.  Trump keeps getting basic facts mixed up (like the fact he‚Äôs running against Biden not Obama) lies constantly tried to overthrow the 2020 election had govt docs in Mar-A-Largo‚Äôs bathroom and Project 2025 has horrific consequences for the country.  And yet‚Ä¶nothing. I‚Äôve seen more articles wondering if Biden should step down due to a bad debate than articles about Project 2025.   The unspoken idea is that Biden is the adult in the room Trump can‚Äôt be reasoned with so if anything can be done to prevent a lot of people‚Äôs rights being taken away it‚Äôs on Biden and the Dems.   Which then gives people the impression that Biden and Trump are candidates on equal ground. Which they aren‚Äôt. The bar is on the floor for Trump.   Look how much pushback Biden got for a bad debate performance. We‚Äôre getting swamped with articles about how he should step down. Look how much pushback Trump is getting for any of the actions I listed above. No articles are coming out for him to step down bc everyone‚Äôs decided he can‚Äôt be reasoned with.  Honestly just please remember this if you‚Äôre thinking about not voting this Nov. The candidates are not equal elections have consequences and assuming that we‚Äôll have the same outcome if Biden gets elected or if Trump gets elected is due to a massive gaslighting campaign on the American people.,2024-07-08 16:48:51 GMT

Not Commander &amp; Chief Trump claimed he was going to build a wall along our southern border to protect our country. This wall would be paid for by Mexico as well. False &amp; false.  Trump started building a wall with funds from US taxpayers and shifting money from other government programs. Including military programs. Mexico paid not one cent towards the wall that is still incomplete to this day. Now Trump wants to blame democrats for a crisis at the border after he contacted his fellow republican members and instructed them to halt a bill that republicans created to help solve the problem once and for all. Because it would be another victory for Joe Biden and Trump wanted to run his campaign on the crisis at the border. So who‚Äôs to blame for the crisis at the border Donald?        Trump said he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with a better healthcare system known as Trumpcare. False &amp; false.  After insulting John McCain time and time again. Donald Trump needed his fellow republicans to seal a repeal of Obamacare. A sick and weakened John McCain came back to Washington to show that Donald Trump is not a leader and voted to keep Americans insured with Obamacare. Furthermore to this day not one person has seen the supposed replacement known as Trumpcare.        Trump said he‚Äôd drain the swamp. That all his wealthy friends would dislike him because of the taxes he‚Äôd place upon them. False &amp; false.  Trump enabled the wealthy to become even more wealthier by cutting theirs‚Äô and his taxes. The wealthy pay less than the middle class in the United States.

That was his message in a letter to congressional Democrats Monday as they return to Washington from their July 4 recess.  Now that you have returned from the July 4th recess I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere I am firmly committed to staying in this race to running this race to the end and to beating Donald Trump.  I have had extensive conversations with the leadership of the party elected officials rank and file members and most importantly Democratic voters over these past 10 days or so. I have heard the concerns that people have their good faith fears and worries about what is at stake in this election. I am not blind to them. Believe me I know better than anyone the responsibility and the burden the nominee of our party carries. I carried it in 2020 when the fate of our nation was at stake. I also know these concerns come from a place of real respect for my lifetime of public service and my record as President and I have been moved by the expressions of affection for me from so many who have known me well and supported me over the course of my public: life. I‚Äôve been grateful for the rock-solid steadfast support from so many elected Democrats in Congress and all across the country and taken great strength from the resolve and determination I‚Äôve seen from so many voters and grassroots supporters even in the hardest weeks.  I can respond to all this by saying clearly and unequivocally: I wouldn‚Äôt be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024.  Biden went on to tout his decisive victory in this year‚Äôs Democratic primary asserting his ‚Äúdeep obligation to the faith and the trust the voters of the Democratic Party have placed in me to run this year.‚Äù  ‚Ä¶  The letter is a powerful response to critics who have said Biden needs to make a strong case for his candidacy and why Trump is unacceptable. It lays out many of the arguments he has been making on the campaign trail. Whether the letter will satisfy those who say Biden‚Äôs performance in the debate nearly two weeks ago indicate he‚Äôs not capable of taking on Trump‚Äîwell that‚Äôs to be determined. But it‚Äôs clear that as of now Biden has no intention of dropping out of the race and he‚Äôs hoping this letter is the final word on the matter as he concludes by calling on Democrats to stop questioning his candidacy and unite to defeat Trump.     President Joe Biden (D) wrote a letter to Congressional Democrats announcing that he is staying put as the Democratic nominee even as a portion of the Democratic Congressional electeds have called for him to step aside.,2024-07-08 20:34:37 GMT

Here is Biden‚Äôs letter to the congressional Democrats whose backing he likely needs:  ‚ÄúFellow Democrats  Now that you have returned from the July 4th recess I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere I am firmly committed to staying in this race to running this race to the end and to beating Donald Trump.  I have had extensive conversations with the leadership of the party elected officials rank and file members and most importantly Democratic voters over these past 10 days or so.

I can respond to all this by saying clearly and unequivocally: I wouldn‚Äôt be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024.  We had a Democratic nomination process and the voters have spoken clearly and decisively. I received over 14 million votes 87% of the votes cast across the entire nominating process. I have nearly 3000 delegates making me the presumptive nominee of our party by a wide margin.  This was a process open to anyone who wanted to run. Only three people chose to challenge me. One fared so badly that he left the primaries to run as an independent. Another attacked me for being too old and was soundly defeated. The voters of the Democratic Party have voted. They have chosen me to be the nominee of the party.  Do we now just say this process didn‚Äôt matter? That the voters don‚Äôt have a say?  I decline to do that. I feel a deep obligation to the faith and the trust the voters of the Democratic Party have placed in me to run this year. It was their decision to make. Not the press not the pundits not the big donors not any selected group of individuals no matter how well intentioned. The voters ‚Äî and the voters alone ‚Äî decide the nominee of the Democratic Party. How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party? I cannot do that. I will not do that.  I have no doubt that I ‚Äî and we ‚Äî can and will beat Donald Trump. We have an historic record of success to run on. From creating over 15 million jobs (including 200000 just last month) reaching historic lows on unemployment to revitalizing American manufacturing with 800000 jobs to protecting and expanding affordable health care to rebuilding America‚Äôs roads bridges highways ports and airports and water systems to beating Big Pharma and lowering the cost of prescription drugs including $35 a month insulin for seniors to providing student debt relief for nearly 5 million Americans to an historic investment in combatting climate change.  More importantly we have an economic vision to run on that soundly beats Trump and the MAGA Republicans.

14,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'politics'  'project 2025'  'immigration'],empireofthestates,If you are one of the people who will be directly affected by Project 2025 - if you are transgender a woman lgbtqia+ an immigrant or atheist I strongly encourage you to formulate an escape/survival plan.  IF YOU PLAN TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY: Join expat groups on Faceb00k. People will often post housing job offers or general advice in these groups that may be beneficial when moving. (Expat groups I‚Äôm in: Mexico: 1 2 3 4 / Canada: 1 2 3 / Sweden: 1 2 / Germany: 1 2) Apply for a U.S. Passport. As it currently stands you can‚Äôt travel to many places internationally without one. If you are trying to move before refugee status is available this document will become necessary. Passports are still backed up right now and can take months to arrive. If you are able start applying now! Brush up on any marketable skills. Look into the country you want to move to and see if you have any skills they are in need of! Lots of countries will often expedite your immigration status if you have skills they need.  Make sure you can take your pets with you. Lots of countries have breed restrictions (for instance the U.K. has banned pitbulls and other bully breeds). Make sure that wherever you are going you can take your pets. Look into travel options for dogs (airline cruise etc.) If you can‚Äôt take your pets make a plan to leave them with someone stateside who will take care of them. Do your best to minimize the risk of them ending up at a shelter.  Buy a house in your desired country. Many countries such as Portugal view buying property in their country as a verifiable means of immigration. Many countries also have lower housing prices than the U.S. so it may be more financially feasible than buying stateside. Move closer to the border. If you plan to move somewhere that shares a land border with the U.S. consider moving closer to that border. My partner and I are currently looking at moving from South Carolina to Washington state so that if the time comes we are that much closer to the border.  Figure out how you‚Äôre going to get there. If you are driving (Canada Mexico) look into importing your car. Canada has specific regulations about what kinds of cars are allowed to be imported due to their strict environmental protection laws.  Learn the language. Duolingo and YouTube University are both free! IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT LEAVE THE COUNTRY STILL FORMULATE A PLAN: Create a community. Make friends with people of a similar mindset as you. Collaborate amongst each other to keep each other safe. Create groups in your local area. Meet at the library or a local park. Make connections and allies so when the time comes you are not alone.  Find out what assets you can liquidate quickly for extra cash. If you have things like gold jewelry keep those. Gold is often better than cash (especially if inflation keeps going up). However gaming consoles collectibles and antiques may be easily sold/pawned if you need to get cash quickly. Make notes of what valuables you have.  Learn survival skills. Maybe not completely necessary but rather safe than sorry. Learn how to build a shelter start a fire and forage. I did most of my survival training at a YMCA. YouTube and your local library are also great places to look! Create spaces in your home where you can hide things. Make false bottoms in dresser drawers. Make a false wall in your closet or a hidden crawlspace access.  Stockpile the things you need. If you need certain meds to function try to find alternative ways to get them. If you have the money to buy extra canned food put them away in storage. If you smoke stockpile cigarettes or other tobacco products. Those may also be helpful for trading later.  Protect yourselves. If you have no other choice find a way to protect yourself if the time comes. Whether that is through allies or weapons PROTECT YOURSELF. At the end of the day your life is more important than your politics. Don‚Äôt be a Batman when N@zis are on the loose.  MOST IMPORTANTLY: Do not lose hope! More than anything people have the ‚Äúindomitable human spirit.‚Äù When push comes to shove humanity fights back. Generations before us have fought to protect themselves before and we will do it again. Our communities will survive.,2024-07-08 21:07:58 GMT

1,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'politics'  'project 2025'  'pride'  'lgbtqia'  'transgender'],empireofthestates,I know its dismal to hear but I really don‚Äôt think the presidential election votes will have any direct impact on Project 2025.   If Trump gets elected then yes obviously it will pass through without any hindrance and more likely it will pass with vigor. But if someone besides a felon is elected I doubt it will make any difference wether or not it is passed.   The Presidential office was designed to not have much power. It was designed to be more of a figurehead for diplomatic meetings and to calm the other governments in the 18th century. The President was created to look like a king without having the kind of power of a king. This of course is why the Supreme Court‚Äôs recent decision about pardoning ‚ÄúOfficial Acts‚Äù is such an awful and unconstitutional decision.   All this to say even if Biden or another democrat is elected I don‚Äôt foresee it doing any good to stop Project 2025. Sure they could veto the bill. But if Congress is mostly Republican controlled and if the conservative Supreme Court gets involved they will have no trouble codifying it into law with or without Presidential approval. Especially since Biden has already said he would not ‚Äúabuse‚Äù the new powers granted him by the Supreme Court (although if I were in that situation I don‚Äôt know what my decision would be either).,2024-07-08 22:24:54 GMT

14,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'politics'  'project 2025'  'immigration'],empireofthestates,If you are one of the people who will be directly affected by Project 2025 - if you are transgender a woman lgbtqia+ an immigrant or atheist I strongly encourage you to formulate an escape/survival plan.  IF YOU PLAN TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY: Join expat groups on Faceb00k. People will often post housing job offers or general advice in these groups that may be beneficial when moving. (Expat groups I‚Äôm in: Mexico: 1 2 3 4 / Canada: 1 2 3 / Sweden: 1 2 / Germany: 1 2) Apply for a U.S. Passport. As it currently stands you can‚Äôt travel to many places internationally without one. If you are trying to move before refugee status is available this document will become necessary. Passports are still backed up right now and can take months to arrive. If you are able start applying now! Brush up on any marketable skills. Look into the country you want to move to and see if you have any skills they are in need of! Lots of countries will often expedite your immigration status if you have skills they need.  Make sure you can take your pets with you. Lots of countries have breed restrictions (for instance the U.K. has banned pitbulls and other bully breeds). Make sure that wherever you are going you can take your pets. Look into travel options for dogs (airline cruise etc.) If you can‚Äôt take your pets make a plan to leave them with someone stateside who will take care of them. Do your best to minimize the risk of them ending up at a shelter.  Buy a house in your desired country. Many countries such as Portugal view buying property in their country as a verifiable means of immigration. Many countries also have lower housing prices than the U.S. so it may be more financially feasible than buying stateside. Move closer to the border. If you plan to move somewhere that shares a land border with the U.S. consider moving closer to that border. My partner and I are currently looking at moving from South Carolina to Washington state so that if the time comes we are that much closer to the border.  Figure out how you‚Äôre going to get there. If you are driving (Canada Mexico) look into importing your car. Canada has specific regulations about what kinds of cars are allowed to be imported due to their strict environmental protection laws.  Learn the language. Duolingo and YouTube University are both free! IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT LEAVE THE COUNTRY STILL FORMULATE A PLAN: Create a community. Make friends with people of a similar mindset as you. Collaborate amongst each other to keep each other safe. Create groups in your local area. Meet at the library or a local park. Make connections and allies so when the time comes you are not alone.  Find out what assets you can liquidate quickly for extra cash. If you have things like gold jewelry keep those. Gold is often better than cash (especially if inflation keeps going up). However gaming consoles collectibles and antiques may be easily sold/pawned if you need to get cash quickly. Make notes of what valuables you have.  Learn survival skills. Maybe not completely necessary but rather safe than sorry. Learn how to build a shelter start a fire and forage. I did most of my survival training at a YMCA. YouTube and your local library are also great places to look! Create spaces in your home where you can hide things. Make false bottoms in dresser drawers. Make a false wall in your closet or a hidden crawlspace access.  Stockpile the things you need. If you need certain meds to function try to find alternative ways to get them. If you have the money to buy extra canned food put them away in storage. If you smoke stockpile cigarettes or other tobacco products. Those may also be helpful for trading later.  Protect yourselves. If you have no other choice find a way to protect yourself if the time comes. Whether that is through allies or weapons PROTECT YOURSELF. At the end of the day your life is more important than your politics. Don‚Äôt be a Batman when N@zis are on the loose.  MOST IMPORTANTLY: Do not lose hope! More than anything people have the ‚Äúindomitable human spirit.‚Äù When push comes to shove humanity fights back. Generations before us have fought to protect themselves before and we will do it again. Our communities will survive.,2024-07-08 21:07:58 GMT

14,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'politics'  'project 2025'  'immigration'],empireofthestates,If you are one of the people who will be directly affected by Project 2025 - if you are transgender a woman lgbtqia+ an immigrant or atheist I strongly encourage you to formulate an escape/survival plan.  IF YOU PLAN TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY: Join expat groups on Faceb00k. People will often post housing job offers or general advice in these groups that may be beneficial when moving. (Expat groups I‚Äôm in: Mexico: 1 2 3 4 / Canada: 1 2 3 / Sweden: 1 2 / Germany: 1 2) Apply for a U.S. Passport. As it currently stands you can‚Äôt travel to many places internationally without one. If you are trying to move before refugee status is available this document will become necessary. Passports are still backed up right now and can take months to arrive. If you are able start applying now! Brush up on any marketable skills. Look into the country you want to move to and see if you have any skills they are in need of! Lots of countries will often expedite your immigration status if you have skills they need.  Make sure you can take your pets with you. Lots of countries have breed restrictions (for instance the U.K. has banned pitbulls and other bully breeds). Make sure that wherever you are going you can take your pets. Look into travel options for dogs (airline cruise etc.) If you can‚Äôt take your pets make a plan to leave them with someone stateside who will take care of them. Do your best to minimize the risk of them ending up at a shelter.  Buy a house in your desired country. Many countries such as Portugal view buying property in their country as a verifiable means of immigration. Many countries also have lower housing prices than the U.S. so it may be more financially feasible than buying stateside. Move closer to the border. If you plan to move somewhere that shares a land border with the U.S. consider moving closer to that border. My partner and I are currently looking at moving from South Carolina to Washington state so that if the time comes we are that much closer to the border.  Figure out how you‚Äôre going to get there. If you are driving (Canada Mexico) look into importing your car. Canada has specific regulations about what kinds of cars are allowed to be imported due to their strict environmental protection laws.  Learn the language. Duolingo and YouTube University are both free! IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT LEAVE THE COUNTRY STILL FORMULATE A PLAN: Create a community. Make friends with people of a similar mindset as you. Collaborate amongst each other to keep each other safe. Create groups in your local area. Meet at the library or a local park. Make connections and allies so when the time comes you are not alone.  Find out what assets you can liquidate quickly for extra cash. If you have things like gold jewelry keep those. Gold is often better than cash (especially if inflation keeps going up). However gaming consoles collectibles and antiques may be easily sold/pawned if you need to get cash quickly. Make notes of what valuables you have.  Learn survival skills. Maybe not completely necessary but rather safe than sorry. Learn how to build a shelter start a fire and forage. I did most of my survival training at a YMCA. YouTube and your local library are also great places to look! Create spaces in your home where you can hide things. Make false bottoms in dresser drawers. Make a false wall in your closet or a hidden crawlspace access.  Stockpile the things you need. If you need certain meds to function try to find alternative ways to get them. If you have the money to buy extra canned food put them away in storage. If you smoke stockpile cigarettes or other tobacco products. Those may also be helpful for trading later.  Protect yourselves. If you have no other choice find a way to protect yourself if the time comes. Whether that is through allies or weapons PROTECT YOURSELF. At the end of the day your life is more important than your politics. Don‚Äôt be a Batman when N@zis are on the loose.  MOST IMPORTANTLY: Do not lose hope! More than anything people have the ‚Äúindomitable human spirit.‚Äù When push comes to shove humanity fights back. Generations before us have fought to protect themselves before and we will do it again. Our communities will survive.,2024-07-08 21:07:58 GMT

That was his message in a letter to congressional Democrats Monday as they return to Washington from their July 4 recess.  Now that you have returned from the July 4th recess I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere I am firmly committed to staying in this race to running this race to the end and to beating Donald Trump.  I have had extensive conversations with the leadership of the party elected officials rank and file members and most importantly Democratic voters over these past 10 days or so. I have heard the concerns that people have their good faith fears and worries about what is at stake in this election. I am not blind to them. Believe me I know better than anyone the responsibility and the burden the nominee of our party carries. I carried it in 2020 when the fate of our nation was at stake. I also know these concerns come from a place of real respect for my lifetime of public service and my record as President and I have been moved by the expressions of affection for me from so many who have known me well and supported me over the course of my public: life. I‚Äôve been grateful for the rock-solid steadfast support from so many elected Democrats in Congress and all across the country and taken great strength from the resolve and determination I‚Äôve seen from so many voters and grassroots supporters even in the hardest weeks.  I can respond to all this by saying clearly and unequivocally: I wouldn‚Äôt be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024.  Biden went on to tout his decisive victory in this year‚Äôs Democratic primary asserting his ‚Äúdeep obligation to the faith and the trust the voters of the Democratic Party have placed in me to run this year.‚Äù  ‚Ä¶  The letter is a powerful response to critics who have said Biden needs to make a strong case for his candidacy and why Trump is unacceptable. It lays out many of the arguments he has been making on the campaign trail. Whether the letter will satisfy those who say Biden‚Äôs performance in the debate nearly two weeks ago indicate he‚Äôs not capable of taking on Trump‚Äîwell that‚Äôs to be determined. But it‚Äôs clear that as of now Biden has no intention of dropping out of the race and he‚Äôs hoping this letter is the final word on the matter as he concludes by calling on Democrats to stop questioning his candidacy and unite to defeat Trump.     President Joe Biden (D) wrote a letter to Congressional Democrats announcing that he is staying put as the Democratic nominee even as a portion of the Democratic Congressional electeds have called for him to step aside.,2024-07-08 20:34:37 GMT

He‚Äôs framing the election in purely egotistical terms throwing down the gauntlet to his critics in the party daring them to come after him. This too is a Trumpian move.

Samson was a biblical hero but this type of destructive martyrdom is at odds with democracy which is always a project of collective action not ego satisfaction. This morning Biden called in to Morning Joe on MSNBC.

I‚Äôm not old but I know what it‚Äôs like to have my worst moments held against me.  He prepped to hard and he had a cold. He was dealing with brain fog it was so fucking obvious to me. Colds can bring it on especially when paired with over exhaustion. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll make that mistake of over preparing for the second debate if it happens and let‚Äôs hope no cold either.   His age has been an issue since the beginning and still he was picked as our candidate. And now some democrats want to reverse the votes of millions of people for having a bad night. Another democratic senator comes out wanting him to step down makes me want to fucking scream.   It‚Äôs Too Fucking Late!!!!  Old age brings disability but that doesn‚Äôt mean an automatic disqualification. We‚Äôve had disabled presidents. Ageism presumes all people age in the same way deteriorating the same rate. We don‚Äôt. Someone who is 60 can look and feel 80 and some people are still working in their 90s we are all different. And we all deserve the dignity of deciding when enough is enough for ourselves.  That‚Äôs not to say voters can‚Äôt consider it when someone is running for office and voters decided to stick with Biden. There is also No One capable of stepping up this quickly.  Because fuck it democrats can never just all rally behind the candidate the way republicans do. It‚Äôs embarrassing. It‚Äôs why we are in this position and now some of them want to throw away the incumbency advantage for WHO!?  And I got nothing against Kamala Harris and I hope she runs in 2028 but with Trump on the ballot and this 2025 shit I don‚Äôt want the misogyny vote at play.

The GOP WANTS Biden to stay in because they believe he‚Äôs too week to win. One bad night does not destroy anyone unless they let it or we give up and act like it‚Äôs impossible. Changing horses midstream is simply not viable. There‚Äôs no time to get a campaign up and running. No time to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars to run that campaign. No time to get a new message out there. We have vice presidents for a reason. If it becomes necessary we‚Äôve got the Oval covered. What I don‚Äôt know is if it is mandatory to use the Speaker of the House or if someone else can be brought in. It would be great if Obama could fill that role. There‚Äôs no law stopping him from being VP. He could even be president for two more years before reaching the constitutional limit. But we MUST believe that our candidates ARE prepared ARE strong and ARE capable even if the leader becomes incapacitated after the election. So stop with the hand wringing over Joe. Get behind him! Hell - hold him up if necessary!! But we need to win this thing or there will be nothing to come back to. I went bonkers in 2016 over trump‚Äôs win. But I was NOT wrong about him!!,2024-07-09 00:17:23 GMT

Here‚Äôs My Democratic Proposal to Get Us Out of This Mess | Common Dreams  While there has long been concern about President Biden‚Äôs age and his ability to run an effective campaign many Democrats have resisted any discussion of replacing him at the top of the ticket. They recognize that the president‚Äôs record on domestic issues has been a good one on which to run. They know that his persona directly challenges former President Trump‚Äôs appeal with white working-class voters in key battleground states. And they are afraid of the uncertainties that might accompany his stepping down.  After the president‚Äôs unsettling performance during the June 27th televised debate confronting this concern was no longer speculative. It became urgent. With major news outlets and respected commentators elevating the president‚Äôs mental acuity and the drip drip drip of elected officials beginning to voice their concern Democrats have come to realize that this issue will continue to dominate coverage with media waiting for the next verbal gaffe or sign of frailty.  Instead of this facing this problem the White House and the party have doubled down on denial. They‚Äôve placed blame on the president‚Äôs travel schedule or the effects of a cold and sent emails to supporters comparing the president‚Äôs superior vision for the future of the country with Donald Trump‚Äôs bold-faced lies.  Recognizing that the president‚Äôs performance and capacity are a reality that can‚Äôt be ignored I submitted a proposal to the party outlining a process that would allow the President to step down and be replaced by a candidate chosen through an open transparent and democratic process.

1,Joe Biden,['us politics'  'biden administration'  'vote uncommitted'  '2024 presidential election'  'pass the torch'],plethoraworldatlas,I‚Äôve Been With the DNC for 31 Years. Here‚Äôs My Democratic Proposal to Get Us Out of This Mess | Common Dreams  While there has long been concern about President Biden‚Äôs age and his ability to run an effective campaign many Democrats have resisted any discussion of replacing him at the top of the ticket. They recognize that the president‚Äôs record on domestic issues has been a good one on which to run. They know that his persona directly challenges former President Trump‚Äôs appeal with white working-class voters in key battleground states. And they are afraid of the uncertainties that might accompany his stepping down.  After the president‚Äôs unsettling performance during the June 27th televised debate confronting this concern was no longer speculative. It became urgent. With major news outlets and respected commentators elevating the president‚Äôs mental acuity and the drip drip drip of elected officials beginning to voice their concern Democrats have come to realize that this issue will continue to dominate coverage with media waiting for the next verbal gaffe or sign of frailty.  Instead of this facing this problem the White House and the party have doubled down on denial. They‚Äôve placed blame on the president‚Äôs travel schedule or the effects of a cold and sent emails to supporters comparing the president‚Äôs superior vision for the future of the country with Donald Trump‚Äôs bold-faced lies.  Recognizing that the president‚Äôs performance and capacity are a reality that can‚Äôt be ignored I submitted a proposal to the party outlining a process that would allow the President to step down and be replaced by a candidate chosen through an open transparent and democratic process. It was also one I hoped that would be respectful of the president and his accomplishments.,2024-07-09 02:06:57 GMT

Because they‚Äôre doing exactly what they did in the 2016 presidential race ‚Äì providing wildly asymmetrical and inflammatory coverage of the one candidate running against Donald J Trump.   They have become a stampeding herd producing an avalanche of stories suggesting Biden is unfit will lose and should go away at a point in the campaign in which replacing him would likely be somewhere between extremely difficult and utterly catastrophic. They do this while ignoring something every scholar and critic of journalism knows well and every journalist should. As Nikole Hannah-Jones put it: ‚ÄúAs media we consistently proclaim that we are just reporting the news when in fact we are driving it. What we cover how we cover it determines often what Americans think is important and how they perceive these issues yet we keep pretending it‚Äôs not so.‚Äù They are not reporting that he is a loser; they are making him one.    According to one journalist‚Äôs tally the New York Times has run 192 stories on the subject since the debate including 50 editorials and 142 news stories. The Washington Post which has also gone for saturation coverage published a resignation speech they wrote for him. Not to be outdone the New Yorker‚Äôs editor-in-chief declared that Biden not going away ‚Äúwould be an act not only of self-delusion but of national endangerment‚Äù and had a staff writer suggest that Democrats should use the never-before-deployed 25th amendment.   Since this would have to be led by Vice-President Kamala Harris it would be a sort of insider coup. And so it goes with what appears to be a journalistic competition to outdo each other in the aggressiveness of the attacks and the unreality of the proposals. It‚Äôs a dogpile and a panic and there is no one more unable to understand their own emotional life biases and motives than people who are utterly convinced of their own ironclad rationality and objectivity AKA most of these pundits.   Speaking of coups we‚Äôve had a couple of late which perhaps merit attention as we consider who is unfit to hold office. This time around Trump is not just a celebrity with a lot of sexual assault allegations bankruptcies and loopily malicious statements as he was in 2016. He‚Äôs a convicted criminal who orchestrated a coup attempt to steal an election both through backroom corruption and public lies and through a violent attack on Congress. The extremist US supreme court justices he selected during his last presidential term themselves staged a coup this very Monday overthrowing the US constitution itself and the principle that no one is above the law to make presidents into kings just after legalizing bribery of officials and dismantling the regulatory state by throwing out the Chevron deference.   ‚Ä¶   Biden is old. He was one kind of appalling in the 27 June debate listless and sometimes stumbling and muddling his words. But Trump was another kind of appalling in that almost everything he said was an outrageous lie and some of it was a threat. I get that writing about the monstrosity that is Trump faces the problem that it‚Äôs not news; he‚Äôs been a monster spouting lurid nonsense all his life (but his political crimes are recent and his free-associating public soliloquies on sharks batteries toilets water flow and Hannibal Lector among other topics are genuinely demented). He‚Äôs a racist a fascist and a rapist (according to a civil-court verdict). We are deciding whether this nation has a future as a more-or-less democratic republic this November and on that rides the fate of the earth when it comes to acting on climate change. If the US falters at this decisive moment in the climate crisis it will drag down everyone else‚Äôs efforts. Under Trump it will. But the shocking supreme court decisions this summer and the looming threat of authoritarianism have gotten little ink and air compared to the hue and cry about Biden‚Äôs competence.  Rebecca Solnit at The Guardian on why the pundit class is calling for Joe Biden to suspend his campaign but not Donald Trump to also do the same (07.06.2024).    Rebecca Solnit‚Äôs opinion column at The Guardian regarding the pundit class‚Äôs demands for Joe Biden to end his campaign over a bad debate performance but not for Donald Trump to do the same over his 34 felonies is a masterclass.,2024-07-09 10:02:26 GMT

Because they‚Äôre doing exactly what they did in the 2016 presidential race ‚Äì providing wildly asymmetrical and inflammatory coverage of the one candidate running against Donald J Trump.   They have become a stampeding herd producing an avalanche of stories suggesting Biden is unfit will lose and should go away at a point in the campaign in which replacing him would likely be somewhere between extremely difficult and utterly catastrophic. They do this while ignoring something every scholar and critic of journalism knows well and every journalist should. As Nikole Hannah-Jones put it: ‚ÄúAs media we consistently proclaim that we are just reporting the news when in fact we are driving it. What we cover how we cover it determines often what Americans think is important and how they perceive these issues yet we keep pretending it‚Äôs not so.‚Äù They are not reporting that he is a loser; they are making him one.    According to one journalist‚Äôs tally the New York Times has run 192 stories on the subject since the debate including 50 editorials and 142 news stories.

Not to be outdone the New Yorker‚Äôs editor-in-chief declared that Biden not going away ‚Äúwould be an act not only of self-delusion but of national endangerment‚Äù and had a staff writer suggest that Democrats should use the never-before-deployed 25th amendment.

Speaking of coups we‚Äôve had a couple of late which perhaps merit attention as we consider who is unfit to hold office. This time around Trump is not just a celebrity with a lot of sexual assault allegations bankruptcies and loopily malicious statements as he was in 2016. He‚Äôs a convicted criminal who orchestrated a coup attempt to steal an election both through backroom corruption and public lies and through a violent attack on Congress. The extremist US supreme court justices he selected during his last presidential term themselves staged a coup this very Monday overthrowing the US constitution itself and the principle that no one is above the law to make presidents into kings just after legalizing bribery of officials and dismantling the regulatory state by throwing out the Chevron deference.   ‚Ä¶   Biden is old.

His rhetoric and the initiatives he supports such as Project 2025 have raised significant concerns among political analysts and historians. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at why Kevin Roberts is considered a danger to democracy.  Background on Kevin Roberts Kevin Roberts took the helm of the Heritage Foundation in 2021. Under his leadership the organization has shifted further to the right embracing a more aggressive stance in the culture wars. Roberts has been vocal about his support for former President Donald Trump and his policies aligning himself with the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement.  Project 2025: A Blueprint for Authoritarianism One of the most alarming aspects of Roberts‚Äô tenure is his involvement in Project 2025. This initiative is a comprehensive plan designed to overhaul the federal government in the event of a Republican victory in the 2024 presidential election. The project aims to dismantle various aspects of the federal government and replace thousands of civil servants with Trump loyalists1. This plan has been criticized for its potential to undermine democratic institutions and concentrate power in the hands of a few.  Rhetoric of Revolution and Violence Roberts has not shied away from using incendiary language. He has referred to the current political climate as the ‚Äúsecond American Revolution‚Äù and has suggested that this revolution will remain bloodless ‚Äúif the left allows it to be&quot;21. Such statements have been interpreted as veiled threats of violence suggesting that any resistance to the MAGA agenda could lead to bloodshed. This kind of rhetoric is dangerous as it can incite violence and further polarize an already divided nation.  Undermining Democratic Norms Roberts‚Äô support for the Supreme Court‚Äôs recent decision to grant the president broad immunity from prosecution is another cause for concern2. This ruling effectively places the president above the law undermining the principle of accountability that is fundamental to a functioning democracy. By celebrating this decision Roberts is endorsing a form of governance where the president can act with impunity which is antithetical to democratic values.  Alignment with Extremist Groups Roberts‚Äô language and actions have drawn comparisons to extremist groups like the Oath Keepers2. His talk of revolution and bloodshed echoes the rhetoric of these groups which have been involved in violent actions against the government. By aligning himself with such ideologies Roberts is legitimizing extremist views and encouraging their spread within mainstream politics.  Historical Parallels Historians like Ruth Ben-Ghiat have drawn parallels between Roberts‚Äô actions and those of fascist leaders in the past23. Ben-Ghiat an expert on Italian fascism has pointed out that Roberts‚Äô celebration of the Supreme Court ruling and his threats of violence are reminiscent of tactics used by fascist regimes to consolidate power. These historical parallels serve as a warning of the potential dangers posed by Roberts‚Äô rhetoric and actions.  Impact on the 2024 Election As the 2024 election approaches Roberts‚Äô influence is likely to grow. His role in shaping the agenda for a potential second Trump term means that his extremist views could become policy. This prospect is alarming for those who value democratic norms and institutions. The potential for increased polarization and violence is high and the very fabric of American democracy could be at risk.  Conclusion Kevin Roberts‚Äô actions and rhetoric represent a significant threat to democracy. His involvement in Project 2025 his incendiary language and his support for undermining democratic norms all point to a dangerous trajectory for American politics. As we move closer to the 2024 election it is crucial to remain vigilant and to advocate for the preservation of democratic values and institutions.  By understanding the dangers posed by figures like Kevin Roberts we can better prepare to defend democracy and ensure that it remains resilient in the face of authoritarian threats.,2024-07-09 13:46:10 GMT

This analysis aims to explore the reasons why some individuals and groups express apprehension about the project and to evaluate whether these concerns are deemed extreme. Additionally this discourse will consider potential modifications to address these concerns and Perceptions of Extremism  Scope and Ambition    Project 2025 has been widely viewed as ambitiously forward-thinking. While some express concerns about its comprehensive scope possibly causing unforeseen disruptions to current systems critics suggest these challenges are natural in pioneering endeavors. The project‚Äôs magnitude naturally provokes apprehensions regarding its feasibility and long-term sustainability. However such bold initiatives are essential to drive innovation and address pressing global challenges. By carefully navigating potential pitfalls and leveraging comprehensive planning Project 2025 can emerge as a transformative force for progress laying a robust foundation for a sustainable future.  Political and Social Implications  The project‚Äôs political and social ramifications are pivotal concerns. Detractors argue it could bring about sweeping alterations to societal norms and governance potentially marginalizing specific demographics. These transformative shifts are frequently perceived as revolutionary thereby evoking apprehensions about its radical nature. Such apprehensions underscore the need for a careful examination of its potential impact on inclusivity and social cohesion. It is imperative to navigate these concerns with a balanced approach that ensures equitable outcomes and fosters constructive dialogue about the project‚Äôs goals and implications for a harmonious society.  Economic Impact  Concerns abound regarding the economic repercussions of Project 2025. Critics contend that the necessary financial resources might overburden public finances potentially necessitating higher taxes or diverting funds from essential sectors. Such economic uncertainties are seen as fueling perceptions of radicalism. It is crucial to address these apprehensions through careful planning and transparent communication about the project‚Äôs long-term benefits. By emphasizing strategic economic growth and prudent resource management we can mitigate fears and build consensus on the project‚Äôs potential to foster sustainable development and economic stability. This approach ensures that Project 2025 is viewed not as a risk but as a catalyst for positive change.  Technological and Ethical Concerns  The integration of advanced technologies in Project 2025 raises significant ethical and privacy concerns making it a contentious initiative. The potential for surveillance data misuse and erosion of individual freedoms stokes widespread fears. As we embrace these technologies we must address the ethical implications to safeguard privacy and uphold fundamental rights. Ensuring transparent and responsible use of data can alleviate concerns and foster trust. By prioritizing ethical considerations Project 2025 can become a beacon of innovation that respects privacy and individual freedoms turning a potential threat into an opportunity for responsible technological advancement.  Potential for Adaptation  To mitigate the perceived extremism of Project 2025 and address the apprehensions the following adaptations could be considered:  Incremental Implementation  Adopting a phased approach to project implementation offers the opportunity for continuous assessment and refinement at each stage. This strategy not only facilitates better risk management but also mitigates concerns about abrupt changes. By breaking down the project into manageable phases we can identify and address issues promptly ensuring smoother transitions and more effective solutions. This method fosters a more controlled and adaptable environment increasing the likelihood of success while minimizing disruption. Embracing this incremental approach will ultimately lead to more sustainable and positive outcomes for the entire team.  Transparent Communication  Improving transparency regarding the project‚Äôs objectives procedures and potential outcomes is crucial for fostering public trust. Engaging openly with stakeholders and employing effective communication strategies are essential steps in combating misinformation and alleviating concerns. By clearly articulating our goals and methods we can establish credibility and reassure the community about the project‚Äôs positive impacts. Emphasizing these aspects not only enhances understanding but also cultivates a supportive environment where informed decisions can be made collaboratively. This approach ensures that all parties are well-informed and aligned promoting a constructive dialogue that strengthens confidence and minimizes uncertainties.  Ethical Guidelines and Oversight  Implementing stringent ethical guidelines and independent oversight mechanisms effectively addresses worries regarding privacy and data security. Prioritizing ethical considerations not only safeguards sensitive information but also cultivates trust and support from the public. By adhering to these principles we demonstrate our commitment to transparency and accountability fostering a climate where individuals feel secure and valued. This approach not only mitigates risks but also enhances our credibility ensuring that our practices align with the highest standards of integrity and responsibility. Ultimately integrating robust ethical frameworks is pivotal in garnering widespread endorsement and maintaining ethical leadership in data management.  Economic Safeguards  Implementing economic safeguards is crucial to shield vulnerable groups and promote fair resource allocation alleviating concerns about financial burdens. Transparent budgeting and stringent financial accountability are indispensable in fostering trust and ensuring equitable distribution of resources. By instituting these measures we not only protect the most vulnerable but also uphold principles of fairness and responsibility. This proactive approach not only mitigates fears of economic strain but also lays the foundation for a sustainable and inclusive economic framework that benefits all segments of society.  Conclusion  Project 2025‚Äôs ambitious nature and potential for significant societal impact inevitably lead to concerns about its extremism. By understanding these apprehensions and considering adaptive strategies it is possible to address the fears and work towards a more balanced and acceptable implementation. Engaging with stakeholders ensuring transparency and prioritizing ethical considerations are critical steps in this,2024-07-09 13:25:59 GMT

The head Gay Caballero turns out to be Anthony Bernal the First Lady‚Äôs top aide.‚Äú  From the New York Post by Steven Nelson Published July 4 2024  President Biden‚Äôs inner circle has gotten smaller following his disastrous debate last week ‚Äî with his wife‚Äôs top aide Anthony Bernal emerging as one of the 81-year-old‚Äôs key advisers alongside longtime confidante Mike Donilon four sources close to or inside the White House tell The Post.  Bernal 51 is a divisive figure for allegedly bullying and sexually harassing male colleagues ‚Äî and his influence was likened by three sources to that held by the mystic Grigori Rasputin over the family and court of Nicholas II the last czar of Russia.  First lady Jill Biden considers Bernal her ‚Äúwork husband‚Äù and he‚Äôs also close to scandal-plagued first son Hunter whom Bernal greeted with a hug June 11 after his felony gun conviction.  The ‚Äúopenly gay‚Äù Bernal is an alumnus of that finishing school for Inner Party Elites the University of Texas at El Paso.  ‚ÄúDonilon and Bernal are 100% the most important advisers post-debate‚Äù said one Democratic source close to the administration.  ‚Ä¶ A White House source told The Post that many of the president‚Äôs old guard of longtime aides are believed to be left out of the loop of discussions ‚Äúabout what‚Äôs next‚Äù ‚Äî saying Bernal who frequently vacations with the first family ‚Äúseriously‚Äù has a Rasputin-like pull over the first family.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Another source said they agreed with the Rasputin analogy ‚Äî describing Bernal‚Äôs influence and immunity from consequences for alleged personal misconduct as perplexing to fellow aides.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like a tick who has just latched himself on for the last 15 years‚Äù this source said.  ‚ÄúAccurate and on point‚Äù said a third source of the comparison to Rasputin who was murdered in December 1916 by rivals who believed he was contributing to poor decision-making in the months before the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in which the royal family was ultimately toppled and killed.  ‚ÄúEveryone has kept their heads down about Bernal and just tries to avoid him at all costs‚Äù the third source said. ‚ÄúBut everyone always predicted that this movie would end badly because of how he treats colleagues and always poisons the well for anyone else with the Bidens.  ‚ÄúHe will go down with the ship but he‚Äôs also the one behind the wheel.‚Äù  One veteran Democratic aide went so far as to say ‚Äúthe country would be better off with Trump‚Äù than Biden if Bernal was helping run the government.,2024-07-09 13:20:12 GMT

Here‚Äôs Why. - The N‚Ä¶  May 24 2024  Mr. Biden‚Äôs aides agree that electric vehicles ‚Äî which retail for more than $53000 on average in the United States ‚Äî would sell even faster here if they were less expensive. As it happens there is a wave of new electric vehicles that are significantly cheaper than the ones customers can currently buy in the United States. They are proving extremely popular in Europe. But the president and his team do not want Americans to buy these cheap cars which retail elsewhere for as little as $10000 because they are made in China. That‚Äôs true even though a surge of low-cost imported electric vehicles might help drive down car prices overall potentially helping Mr. Biden in his re-election campaign at a time when inflation remains voters‚Äô top economic concern. Instead the president is taking steps to make Chinese electric vehicles prohibitively expensive in large part to protect American automakers. Mr. Biden signed an executive action earlier this month that quadruples tariffs on those cars to 100 percent.  imagine thinking this guy for real cares about climate change and not the minimum optics necessary to get democrat establishment support,2024-07-09 13:07:43 GMT

Because they‚Äôre doing exactly what they did in the 2016 presidential race ‚Äì providing wildly asymmetrical and inflammatory coverage of the one candidate running against Donald J Trump.   They have become a stampeding herd producing an avalanche of stories suggesting Biden is unfit will lose and should go away at a point in the campaign in which replacing him would likely be somewhere between extremely difficult and utterly catastrophic. They do this while ignoring something every scholar and critic of journalism knows well and every journalist should. As Nikole Hannah-Jones put it: ‚ÄúAs media we consistently proclaim that we are just reporting the news when in fact we are driving it. What we cover how we cover it determines often what Americans think is important and how they perceive these issues yet we keep pretending it‚Äôs not so.‚Äù They are not reporting that he is a loser; they are making him one.    According to one journalist‚Äôs tally the New York Times has run 192 stories on the subject since the debate including 50 editorials and 142 news stories. The Washington Post which has also gone for saturation coverage published a resignation speech they wrote for him. Not to be outdone the New Yorker‚Äôs editor-in-chief declared that Biden not going away ‚Äúwould be an act not only of self-delusion but of national endangerment‚Äù and had a staff writer suggest that Democrats should use the never-before-deployed 25th amendment.   Since this would have to be led by Vice-President Kamala Harris it would be a sort of insider coup. And so it goes with what appears to be a journalistic competition to outdo each other in the aggressiveness of the attacks and the unreality of the proposals. It‚Äôs a dogpile and a panic and there is no one more unable to understand their own emotional life biases and motives than people who are utterly convinced of their own ironclad rationality and objectivity AKA most of these pundits.   Speaking of coups we‚Äôve had a couple of late which perhaps merit attention as we consider who is unfit to hold office. This time around Trump is not just a celebrity with a lot of sexual assault allegations bankruptcies and loopily malicious statements as he was in 2016. He‚Äôs a convicted criminal who orchestrated a coup attempt to steal an election both through backroom corruption and public lies and through a violent attack on Congress. The extremist US supreme court justices he selected during his last presidential term themselves staged a coup this very Monday overthrowing the US constitution itself and the principle that no one is above the law to make presidents into kings just after legalizing bribery of officials and dismantling the regulatory state by throwing out the Chevron deference.   ‚Ä¶   Biden is old. He was one kind of appalling in the 27 June debate listless and sometimes stumbling and muddling his words. But Trump was another kind of appalling in that almost everything he said was an outrageous lie and some of it was a threat. I get that writing about the monstrosity that is Trump faces the problem that it‚Äôs not news; he‚Äôs been a monster spouting lurid nonsense all his life (but his political crimes are recent and his free-associating public soliloquies on sharks batteries toilets water flow and Hannibal Lector among other topics are genuinely demented). He‚Äôs a racist a fascist and a rapist (according to a civil-court verdict). We are deciding whether this nation has a future as a more-or-less democratic republic this November and on that rides the fate of the earth when it comes to acting on climate change. If the US falters at this decisive moment in the climate crisis it will drag down everyone else‚Äôs efforts. Under Trump it will. But the shocking supreme court decisions this summer and the looming threat of authoritarianism have gotten little ink and air compared to the hue and cry about Biden‚Äôs competence.

His rhetoric and the initiatives he supports such as Project 2025 have raised significant concerns among political analysts and historians. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at why Kevin Roberts is considered a danger to democracy.  Background on Kevin Roberts Kevin Roberts took the helm of the Heritage Foundation in 2021. Under his leadership the organization has shifted further to the right embracing a more aggressive stance in the culture wars. Roberts has been vocal about his support for former President Donald Trump and his policies aligning himself with the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement.  Project 2025: A Blueprint for Authoritarianism One of the most alarming aspects of Roberts‚Äô tenure is his involvement in Project 2025. This initiative is a comprehensive plan designed to overhaul the federal government in the event of a Republican victory in the 2024 presidential election. The project aims to dismantle various aspects of the federal government and replace thousands of civil servants with Trump loyalists1. This plan has been criticized for its potential to undermine democratic institutions and concentrate power in the hands of a few.  Rhetoric of Revolution and Violence Roberts has not shied away from using incendiary language. He has referred to the current political climate as the ‚Äúsecond American Revolution‚Äù and has suggested that this revolution will remain bloodless ‚Äúif the left allows it to be&quot;21. Such statements have been interpreted as veiled threats of violence suggesting that any resistance to the MAGA agenda could lead to bloodshed. This kind of rhetoric is dangerous as it can incite violence and further polarize an already divided nation.  Undermining Democratic Norms Roberts‚Äô support for the Supreme Court‚Äôs recent decision to grant the president broad immunity from prosecution is another cause for concern2. This ruling effectively places the president above the law undermining the principle of accountability that is fundamental to a functioning democracy. By celebrating this decision Roberts is endorsing a form of governance where the president can act with impunity which is antithetical to democratic values.  Alignment with Extremist Groups Roberts‚Äô language and actions have drawn comparisons to extremist groups like the Oath Keepers2. His talk of revolution and bloodshed echoes the rhetoric of these groups which have been involved in violent actions against the government. By aligning himself with such ideologies Roberts is legitimizing extremist views and encouraging their spread within mainstream politics.  Historical Parallels Historians like Ruth Ben-Ghiat have drawn parallels between Roberts‚Äô actions and those of fascist leaders in the past23. Ben-Ghiat an expert on Italian fascism has pointed out that Roberts‚Äô celebration of the Supreme Court ruling and his threats of violence are reminiscent of tactics used by fascist regimes to consolidate power. These historical parallels serve as a warning of the potential dangers posed by Roberts‚Äô rhetoric and actions.  Impact on the 2024 Election As the 2024 election approaches Roberts‚Äô influence is likely to grow. His role in shaping the agenda for a potential second Trump term means that his extremist views could become policy. This prospect is alarming for those who value democratic norms and institutions. The potential for increased polarization and violence is high and the very fabric of American democracy could be at risk.  Conclusion Kevin Roberts‚Äô actions and rhetoric represent a significant threat to democracy. His involvement in Project 2025 his incendiary language and his support for undermining democratic norms all point to a dangerous trajectory for American politics. As we move closer to the 2024 election it is crucial to remain vigilant and to advocate for the preservation of democratic values and institutions.  By understanding the dangers posed by figures like Kevin Roberts we can better prepare to defend democracy and ensure that it remains resilient in the face of authoritarian threats.,2024-07-09 13:46:10 GMT

By carefully navigating potential pitfalls and leveraging comprehensive planning Project 2025 can emerge as a transformative force for progress laying a robust foundation for a sustainable future.  Political and Social Implications  The project‚Äôs political and social ramifications are pivotal concerns. Detractors argue it could bring about sweeping alterations to societal norms and governance potentially marginalizing specific demographics. These transformative shifts are frequently perceived as revolutionary thereby evoking apprehensions about its radical nature. Such apprehensions underscore the need for a careful examination of its potential impact on inclusivity and social cohesion. It is imperative to navigate these concerns with a balanced approach that ensures equitable outcomes and fosters constructive dialogue about the project‚Äôs goals and implications for a harmonious society.  Economic Impact  Concerns abound regarding the economic repercussions of Project 2025. Critics contend that the necessary financial resources might overburden public finances potentially necessitating higher taxes or diverting funds from essential sectors. Such economic uncertainties are seen as fueling perceptions of radicalism. It is crucial to address these apprehensions through careful planning and transparent communication about the project‚Äôs long-term benefits. By emphasizing strategic economic growth and prudent resource management we can mitigate fears and build consensus on the project‚Äôs potential to foster sustainable development and economic stability. This approach ensures that Project 2025 is viewed not as a risk but as a catalyst for positive change.  Technological and Ethical Concerns  The integration of advanced technologies in Project 2025 raises significant ethical and privacy concerns making it a contentious initiative. The potential for surveillance data misuse and erosion of individual freedoms stokes widespread fears. As we embrace these technologies we must address the ethical implications to safeguard privacy and uphold fundamental rights. Ensuring transparent and responsible use of data can alleviate concerns and foster trust. By prioritizing ethical considerations Project 2025 can become a beacon of innovation that respects privacy and individual freedoms turning a potential threat into an opportunity for responsible technological advancement.  Potential for Adaptation  To mitigate the perceived extremism of Project 2025 and address the apprehensions the following adaptations could be considered:  Incremental Implementation  Adopting a phased approach to project implementation offers the opportunity for continuous assessment and refinement at each stage. This strategy not only facilitates better risk management but also mitigates concerns about abrupt changes. By breaking down the project into manageable phases we can identify and address issues promptly ensuring smoother transitions and more effective solutions. This method fosters a more controlled and adaptable environment increasing the likelihood of success while minimizing disruption. Embracing this incremental approach will ultimately lead to more sustainable and positive outcomes for the entire team.  Transparent Communication  Improving transparency regarding the project‚Äôs objectives procedures and potential outcomes is crucial for fostering public trust. Engaging openly with stakeholders and employing effective communication strategies are essential steps in combating misinformation and alleviating concerns. By clearly articulating our goals and methods we can establish credibility and reassure the community about the project‚Äôs positive impacts. Emphasizing these aspects not only enhances understanding but also cultivates a supportive environment where informed decisions can be made collaboratively. This approach ensures that all parties are well-informed and aligned promoting a constructive dialogue that strengthens confidence and minimizes uncertainties.  Ethical Guidelines and Oversight  Implementing stringent ethical guidelines and independent oversight mechanisms effectively addresses worries regarding privacy and data security. Prioritizing ethical considerations not only safeguards sensitive information but also cultivates trust and support from the public. By adhering to these principles we demonstrate our commitment to transparency and accountability fostering a climate where individuals feel secure and valued. This approach not only mitigates risks but also enhances our credibility ensuring that our practices align with the highest standards of integrity and responsibility. Ultimately integrating robust ethical frameworks is pivotal in garnering widespread endorsement and maintaining ethical leadership in data management.  Economic Safeguards  Implementing economic safeguards is crucial to shield vulnerable groups and promote fair resource allocation alleviating concerns about financial burdens. Transparent budgeting and stringent financial accountability are indispensable in fostering trust and ensuring equitable distribution of resources. By instituting these measures we not only protect the most vulnerable but also uphold principles of fairness and responsibility. This proactive approach not only mitigates fears of economic strain but also lays the foundation for a sustainable and inclusive economic framework that benefits all segments of society.  Conclusion  Project 2025‚Äôs ambitious nature and potential for significant societal impact inevitably lead to concerns about its extremism. By understanding these apprehensions and considering adaptive strategies it is possible to address the fears and work towards a more balanced and acceptable implementation. Engaging with stakeholders ensuring transparency and prioritizing ethical considerations are critical steps in this,2024-07-09 13:25:59 GMT

This ‚Äúleak‚Äù might also explain Jill‚Äôs wardrobe üò¨üò≥ ‚ÄúI for one didn‚Äôt have my money on Biden being controlled by a Gay Mexican Cabal.‚Äù  Deep State cabal revealed! The Gay Caballero who is pulling Biden‚Äôs strings by STEVE SAILER  JUL 04 2024  Deep State theory surmises that our nominal leaders with all their obvious flaws (such as senility) are actually puppets having their strings pulled by shadowy but nearly omni-competent massively funded institutions such as the Intelligence Community that routinely mount brilliant triple bankshot psy-ops to manipulate the public. Similar theories point instead to the World Economic Forum Bilderberg the Jews and the lizard people.  As far as I can recall however few whether conspiracists or realists had theorized until now that the ‚ÄúRasputin‚Äù of the Biden Administration is a ‚Ä¶ gay Mexican.  The head Gay Caballero turns out to be Anthony Bernal the First Lady‚Äôs top aide.‚Äú  From the New York Post by Steven Nelson Published July 4 2024  President Biden‚Äôs inner circle has gotten smaller following his disastrous debate last week ‚Äî with his wife‚Äôs top aide Anthony Bernal emerging as one of the 81-year-old‚Äôs key advisers alongside longtime confidante Mike Donilon four sources close to or inside the White House tell The Post.  Bernal 51 is a divisive figure for allegedly bullying and sexually harassing male colleagues ‚Äî and his influence was likened by three sources to that held by the mystic Grigori Rasputin over the family and court of Nicholas II the last czar of Russia.  First lady Jill Biden considers Bernal her ‚Äúwork husband‚Äù and he‚Äôs also close to scandal-plagued first son Hunter whom Bernal greeted with a hug June 11 after his felony gun conviction.  The ‚Äúopenly gay‚Äù Bernal is an alumnus of that finishing school for Inner Party Elites the University of Texas at El Paso.  ‚ÄúDonilon and Bernal are 100% the most important advisers post-debate‚Äù said one Democratic source close to the administration.  ‚Ä¶ A White House source told The Post that many of the president‚Äôs old guard of longtime aides are believed to be left out of the loop of discussions ‚Äúabout what‚Äôs next‚Äù ‚Äî saying Bernal who frequently vacations with the first family ‚Äúseriously‚Äù has a Rasputin-like pull over the first family.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Another source said they agreed with the Rasputin analogy ‚Äî describing Bernal‚Äôs influence and immunity from consequences for alleged personal misconduct as perplexing to fellow aides.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like a tick who has just latched himself on for the last 15 years‚Äù this source said.  ‚ÄúAccurate and on point‚Äù said a third source of the comparison to Rasputin who was murdered in December 1916 by rivals who believed he was contributing to poor decision-making in the months before the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in which the royal family was ultimately toppled and killed.  ‚ÄúEveryone has kept their heads down about Bernal and just tries to avoid him at all costs‚Äù the third source said. ‚ÄúBut everyone always predicted that this movie would end badly because of how he treats colleagues and always poisons the well for anyone else with the Bidens.  ‚ÄúHe will go down with the ship but he‚Äôs also the one behind the wheel.‚Äù  One veteran Democratic aide went so far as to say ‚Äúthe country would be better off with Trump‚Äù than Biden if Bernal was helping run the government.,2024-07-09 13:20:12 GMT

Here‚Äôs Why. - The N‚Ä¶  May 24 2024  Mr. Biden‚Äôs aides agree that electric vehicles ‚Äî which retail for more than $53000 on average in the United States ‚Äî would sell even faster here if they were less expensive. As it happens there is a wave of new electric vehicles that are significantly cheaper than the ones customers can currently buy in the United States. They are proving extremely popular in Europe. But the president and his team do not want Americans to buy these cheap cars which retail elsewhere for as little as $10000 because they are made in China. That‚Äôs true even though a surge of low-cost imported electric vehicles might help drive down car prices overall potentially helping Mr. Biden in his re-election campaign at a time when inflation remains voters‚Äô top economic concern. Instead the president is taking steps to make Chinese electric vehicles prohibitively expensive in large part to protect American automakers. Mr. Biden signed an executive action earlier this month that quadruples tariffs on those cars to 100 percent.  imagine thinking this guy for real cares about climate change and not the minimum optics necessary to get democrat establishment support,2024-07-09 13:07:43 GMT

Because they‚Äôre doing exactly what they did in the 2016 presidential race ‚Äì providing wildly asymmetrical and inflammatory coverage of the one candidate running against Donald J Trump.   They have become a stampeding herd producing an avalanche of stories suggesting Biden is unfit will lose and should go away at a point in the campaign in which replacing him would likely be somewhere between extremely difficult and utterly catastrophic. They do this while ignoring something every scholar and critic of journalism knows well and every journalist should. As Nikole Hannah-Jones put it: ‚ÄúAs media we consistently proclaim that we are just reporting the news when in fact we are driving it. What we cover how we cover it determines often what Americans think is important and how they perceive these issues yet we keep pretending it‚Äôs not so.‚Äù They are not reporting that he is a loser; they are making him one.    According to one journalist‚Äôs tally the New York Times has run 192 stories on the subject since the debate including 50 editorials and 142 news stories. The Washington Post which has also gone for saturation coverage published a resignation speech they wrote for him. Not to be outdone the New Yorker‚Äôs editor-in-chief declared that Biden not going away ‚Äúwould be an act not only of self-delusion but of national endangerment‚Äù and had a staff writer suggest that Democrats should use the never-before-deployed 25th amendment.   Since this would have to be led by Vice-President Kamala Harris it would be a sort of insider coup. And so it goes with what appears to be a journalistic competition to outdo each other in the aggressiveness of the attacks and the unreality of the proposals. It‚Äôs a dogpile and a panic and there is no one more unable to understand their own emotional life biases and motives than people who are utterly convinced of their own ironclad rationality and objectivity AKA most of these pundits.   Speaking of coups we‚Äôve had a couple of late which perhaps merit attention as we consider who is unfit to hold office. This time around Trump is not just a celebrity with a lot of sexual assault allegations bankruptcies and loopily malicious statements as he was in 2016. He‚Äôs a convicted criminal who orchestrated a coup attempt to steal an election both through backroom corruption and public lies and through a violent attack on Congress. The extremist US supreme court justices he selected during his last presidential term themselves staged a coup this very Monday overthrowing the US constitution itself and the principle that no one is above the law to make presidents into kings just after legalizing bribery of officials and dismantling the regulatory state by throwing out the Chevron deference.   ‚Ä¶   Biden is old. He was one kind of appalling in the 27 June debate listless and sometimes stumbling and muddling his words. But Trump was another kind of appalling in that almost everything he said was an outrageous lie and some of it was a threat. I get that writing about the monstrosity that is Trump faces the problem that it‚Äôs not news; he‚Äôs been a monster spouting lurid nonsense all his life (but his political crimes are recent and his free-associating public soliloquies on sharks batteries toilets water flow and Hannibal Lector among other topics are genuinely demented). He‚Äôs a racist a fascist and a rapist (according to a civil-court verdict). We are deciding whether this nation has a future as a more-or-less democratic republic this November and on that rides the fate of the earth when it comes to acting on climate change. If the US falters at this decisive moment in the climate crisis it will drag down everyone else‚Äôs efforts. Under Trump it will. But the shocking supreme court decisions this summer and the looming threat of authoritarianism have gotten little ink and air compared to the hue and cry about Biden‚Äôs competence.

His rhetoric and the initiatives he supports such as Project 2025 have raised significant concerns among political analysts and historians. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at why Kevin Roberts is considered a danger to democracy.  Background on Kevin Roberts Kevin Roberts took the helm of the Heritage Foundation in 2021. Under his leadership the organization has shifted further to the right embracing a more aggressive stance in the culture wars. Roberts has been vocal about his support for former President Donald Trump and his policies aligning himself with the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement.  Project 2025: A Blueprint for Authoritarianism One of the most alarming aspects of Roberts‚Äô tenure is his involvement in Project 2025. This initiative is a comprehensive plan designed to overhaul the federal government in the event of a Republican victory in the 2024 presidential election. The project aims to dismantle various aspects of the federal government and replace thousands of civil servants with Trump loyalists1. This plan has been criticized for its potential to undermine democratic institutions and concentrate power in the hands of a few.  Rhetoric of Revolution and Violence Roberts has not shied away from using incendiary language. He has referred to the current political climate as the ‚Äúsecond American Revolution‚Äù and has suggested that this revolution will remain bloodless ‚Äúif the left allows it to be&quot;21. Such statements have been interpreted as veiled threats of violence suggesting that any resistance to the MAGA agenda could lead to bloodshed. This kind of rhetoric is dangerous as it can incite violence and further polarize an already divided nation.  Undermining Democratic Norms Roberts‚Äô support for the Supreme Court‚Äôs recent decision to grant the president broad immunity from prosecution is another cause for concern2. This ruling effectively places the president above the law undermining the principle of accountability that is fundamental to a functioning democracy. By celebrating this decision Roberts is endorsing a form of governance where the president can act with impunity which is antithetical to democratic values.  Alignment with Extremist Groups Roberts‚Äô language and actions have drawn comparisons to extremist groups like the Oath Keepers2. His talk of revolution and bloodshed echoes the rhetoric of these groups which have been involved in violent actions against the government. By aligning himself with such ideologies Roberts is legitimizing extremist views and encouraging their spread within mainstream politics.  Historical Parallels Historians like Ruth Ben-Ghiat have drawn parallels between Roberts‚Äô actions and those of fascist leaders in the past23. Ben-Ghiat an expert on Italian fascism has pointed out that Roberts‚Äô celebration of the Supreme Court ruling and his threats of violence are reminiscent of tactics used by fascist regimes to consolidate power. These historical parallels serve as a warning of the potential dangers posed by Roberts‚Äô rhetoric and actions.  Impact on the 2024 Election As the 2024 election approaches Roberts‚Äô influence is likely to grow. His role in shaping the agenda for a potential second Trump term means that his extremist views could become policy. This prospect is alarming for those who value democratic norms and institutions. The potential for increased polarization and violence is high and the very fabric of American democracy could be at risk.  Conclusion Kevin Roberts‚Äô actions and rhetoric represent a significant threat to democracy. His involvement in Project 2025 his incendiary language and his support for undermining democratic norms all point to a dangerous trajectory for American politics. As we move closer to the 2024 election it is crucial to remain vigilant and to advocate for the preservation of democratic values and institutions.  By understanding the dangers posed by figures like Kevin Roberts we can better prepare to defend democracy and ensure that it remains resilient in the face of authoritarian threats.,2024-07-09 13:46:10 GMT

This analysis aims to explore the reasons why some individuals and groups express apprehension about the project and to evaluate whether these concerns are deemed extreme. Additionally this discourse will consider potential modifications to address these concerns and Perceptions of Extremism  Scope and Ambition    Project 2025 has been widely viewed as ambitiously forward-thinking. While some express concerns about its comprehensive scope possibly causing unforeseen disruptions to current systems critics suggest these challenges are natural in pioneering endeavors. The project‚Äôs magnitude naturally provokes apprehensions regarding its feasibility and long-term sustainability. However such bold initiatives are essential to drive innovation and address pressing global challenges. By carefully navigating potential pitfalls and leveraging comprehensive planning Project 2025 can emerge as a transformative force for progress laying a robust foundation for a sustainable future.  Political and Social Implications  The project‚Äôs political and social ramifications are pivotal concerns. Detractors argue it could bring about sweeping alterations to societal norms and governance potentially marginalizing specific demographics. These transformative shifts are frequently perceived as revolutionary thereby evoking apprehensions about its radical nature. Such apprehensions underscore the need for a careful examination of its potential impact on inclusivity and social cohesion. It is imperative to navigate these concerns with a balanced approach that ensures equitable outcomes and fosters constructive dialogue about the project‚Äôs goals and implications for a harmonious society.  Economic Impact  Concerns abound regarding the economic repercussions of Project 2025. Critics contend that the necessary financial resources might overburden public finances potentially necessitating higher taxes or diverting funds from essential sectors. Such economic uncertainties are seen as fueling perceptions of radicalism. It is crucial to address these apprehensions through careful planning and transparent communication about the project‚Äôs long-term benefits. By emphasizing strategic economic growth and prudent resource management we can mitigate fears and build consensus on the project‚Äôs potential to foster sustainable development and economic stability. This approach ensures that Project 2025 is viewed not as a risk but as a catalyst for positive change.  Technological and Ethical Concerns  The integration of advanced technologies in Project 2025 raises significant ethical and privacy concerns making it a contentious initiative. The potential for surveillance data misuse and erosion of individual freedoms stokes widespread fears. As we embrace these technologies we must address the ethical implications to safeguard privacy and uphold fundamental rights. Ensuring transparent and responsible use of data can alleviate concerns and foster trust. By prioritizing ethical considerations Project 2025 can become a beacon of innovation that respects privacy and individual freedoms turning a potential threat into an opportunity for responsible technological advancement.  Potential for Adaptation  To mitigate the perceived extremism of Project 2025 and address the apprehensions the following adaptations could be considered:  Incremental Implementation  Adopting a phased approach to project implementation offers the opportunity for continuous assessment and refinement at each stage. This strategy not only facilitates better risk management but also mitigates concerns about abrupt changes. By breaking down the project into manageable phases we can identify and address issues promptly ensuring smoother transitions and more effective solutions. This method fosters a more controlled and adaptable environment increasing the likelihood of success while minimizing disruption. Embracing this incremental approach will ultimately lead to more sustainable and positive outcomes for the entire team.  Transparent Communication  Improving transparency regarding the project‚Äôs objectives procedures and potential outcomes is crucial for fostering public trust. Engaging openly with stakeholders and employing effective communication strategies are essential steps in combating misinformation and alleviating concerns. By clearly articulating our goals and methods we can establish credibility and reassure the community about the project‚Äôs positive impacts. Emphasizing these aspects not only enhances understanding but also cultivates a supportive environment where informed decisions can be made collaboratively. This approach ensures that all parties are well-informed and aligned promoting a constructive dialogue that strengthens confidence and minimizes uncertainties.  Ethical Guidelines and Oversight  Implementing stringent ethical guidelines and independent oversight mechanisms effectively addresses worries regarding privacy and data security.

The Gay Caballero who is pulling Biden‚Äôs strings by STEVE SAILER  JUL 04 2024  Deep State theory surmises that our nominal leaders with all their obvious flaws (such as senility) are actually puppets having their strings pulled by shadowy but nearly omni-competent massively funded institutions such as the Intelligence Community that routinely mount brilliant triple bankshot psy-ops to manipulate the public. Similar theories point instead to the World Economic Forum Bilderberg the Jews and the lizard people.  As far as I can recall however few whether conspiracists or realists had theorized until now that the ‚ÄúRasputin‚Äù of the Biden Administration is a ‚Ä¶ gay Mexican.  The head Gay Caballero turns out to be Anthony Bernal the First Lady‚Äôs top aide.‚Äú  From the New York Post by Steven Nelson Published July 4 2024  President Biden‚Äôs inner circle has gotten smaller following his disastrous debate last week ‚Äî with his wife‚Äôs top aide Anthony Bernal emerging as one of the 81-year-old‚Äôs key advisers alongside longtime confidante Mike Donilon four sources close to or inside the White House tell The Post.  Bernal 51 is a divisive figure for allegedly bullying and sexually harassing male colleagues ‚Äî and his influence was likened by three sources to that held by the mystic Grigori Rasputin over the family and court of Nicholas II the last czar of Russia.  First lady Jill Biden considers Bernal her ‚Äúwork husband‚Äù and he‚Äôs also close to scandal-plagued first son Hunter whom Bernal greeted with a hug June 11 after his felony gun conviction.  The ‚Äúopenly gay‚Äù Bernal is an alumnus of that finishing school for Inner Party Elites the University of Texas at El Paso.  ‚ÄúDonilon and Bernal are 100% the most important advisers post-debate‚Äù said one Democratic source close to the administration.  ‚Ä¶ A White House source told The Post that many of the president‚Äôs old guard of longtime aides are believed to be left out of the loop of discussions ‚Äúabout what‚Äôs next‚Äù ‚Äî saying Bernal who frequently vacations with the first family ‚Äúseriously‚Äù has a Rasputin-like pull over the first family.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Another source said they agreed with the Rasputin analogy ‚Äî describing Bernal‚Äôs influence and immunity from consequences for alleged personal misconduct as perplexing to fellow aides.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like a tick who has just latched himself on for the last 15 years‚Äù this source said.  ‚ÄúAccurate and on point‚Äù said a third source of the comparison to Rasputin who was murdered in December 1916 by rivals who believed he was contributing to poor decision-making in the months before the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in which the royal family was ultimately toppled and killed.  ‚ÄúEveryone has kept their heads down about Bernal and just tries to avoid him at all costs‚Äù the third source said. ‚ÄúBut everyone always predicted that this movie would end badly because of how he treats colleagues and always poisons the well for anyone else with the Bidens.  ‚ÄúHe will go down with the ship but he‚Äôs also the one behind the wheel.‚Äù  One veteran Democratic aide went so far as to say ‚Äúthe country would be better off with Trump‚Äù than Biden if Bernal was helping run the government.,2024-07-09 13:20:12 GMT

She also added:  ‚ÄúAfter a thorough examination there was no evidence of nervous system disorders including Parkinson‚Äôs disease.‚Äù  Biden‚Äôs personal physician Kevin O‚ÄôConnor held a meeting with neurologist and Parkinson‚Äôs disease expert Kevin Cannard earlier this year.

Earlier the head of the US House of Representatives Oversight Committee James Comer invited President Joe Biden‚Äôs physician Kevin O‚ÄôConnor to appear before Congress to testify about the head of state‚Äôs medical examination practices.

Here‚Äôs Why. - The N‚Ä¶  May 24 2024  Mr. Biden‚Äôs aides agree that electric vehicles ‚Äî which retail for more than $53000 on average in the United States ‚Äî would sell even faster here if they were less expensive. As it happens there is a wave of new electric vehicles that are significantly cheaper than the ones customers can currently buy in the United States. They are proving extremely popular in Europe. But the president and his team do not want Americans to buy these cheap cars which retail elsewhere for as little as $10000 because they are made in China. That‚Äôs true even though a surge of low-cost imported electric vehicles might help drive down car prices overall potentially helping Mr. Biden in his re-election campaign at a time when inflation remains voters‚Äô top economic concern. Instead the president is taking steps to make Chinese electric vehicles prohibitively expensive in large part to protect American automakers. Mr. Biden signed an executive action earlier this month that quadruples tariffs on those cars to 100 percent.  imagine thinking this guy for real cares about climate change and not the minimum optics necessary to get democrat establishment support,2024-07-09 13:07:43 GMT

His rhetoric and the initiatives he supports such as Project 2025 have raised significant concerns among political analysts and historians. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at why Kevin Roberts is considered a danger to democracy.  Background on Kevin Roberts Kevin Roberts took the helm of the Heritage Foundation in 2021. Under his leadership the organization has shifted further to the right embracing a more aggressive stance in the culture wars. Roberts has been vocal about his support for former President Donald Trump and his policies aligning himself with the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement.  Project 2025: A Blueprint for Authoritarianism One of the most alarming aspects of Roberts‚Äô tenure is his involvement in Project 2025. This initiative is a comprehensive plan designed to overhaul the federal government in the event of a Republican victory in the 2024 presidential election. The project aims to dismantle various aspects of the federal government and replace thousands of civil servants with Trump loyalists1. This plan has been criticized for its potential to undermine democratic institutions and concentrate power in the hands of a few.  Rhetoric of Revolution and Violence Roberts has not shied away from using incendiary language. He has referred to the current political climate as the ‚Äúsecond American Revolution‚Äù and has suggested that this revolution will remain bloodless ‚Äúif the left allows it to be&quot;21. Such statements have been interpreted as veiled threats of violence suggesting that any resistance to the MAGA agenda could lead to bloodshed. This kind of rhetoric is dangerous as it can incite violence and further polarize an already divided nation.  Undermining Democratic Norms Roberts‚Äô support for the Supreme Court‚Äôs recent decision to grant the president broad immunity from prosecution is another cause for concern2. This ruling effectively places the president above the law undermining the principle of accountability that is fundamental to a functioning democracy. By celebrating this decision Roberts is endorsing a form of governance where the president can act with impunity which is antithetical to democratic values.  Alignment with Extremist Groups Roberts‚Äô language and actions have drawn comparisons to extremist groups like the Oath Keepers2. His talk of revolution and bloodshed echoes the rhetoric of these groups which have been involved in violent actions against the government. By aligning himself with such ideologies Roberts is legitimizing extremist views and encouraging their spread within mainstream politics.  Historical Parallels Historians like Ruth Ben-Ghiat have drawn parallels between Roberts‚Äô actions and those of fascist leaders in the past23. Ben-Ghiat an expert on Italian fascism has pointed out that Roberts‚Äô celebration of the Supreme Court ruling and his threats of violence are reminiscent of tactics used by fascist regimes to consolidate power. These historical parallels serve as a warning of the potential dangers posed by Roberts‚Äô rhetoric and actions.  Impact on the 2024 Election As the 2024 election approaches Roberts‚Äô influence is likely to grow. His role in shaping the agenda for a potential second Trump term means that his extremist views could become policy. This prospect is alarming for those who value democratic norms and institutions. The potential for increased polarization and violence is high and the very fabric of American democracy could be at risk.  Conclusion Kevin Roberts‚Äô actions and rhetoric represent a significant threat to democracy. His involvement in Project 2025 his incendiary language and his support for undermining democratic norms all point to a dangerous trajectory for American politics. As we move closer to the 2024 election it is crucial to remain vigilant and to advocate for the preservation of democratic values and institutions.  By understanding the dangers posed by figures like Kevin Roberts we can better prepare to defend democracy and ensure that it remains resilient in the face of authoritarian threats.,2024-07-09 13:46:10 GMT

Internal discord ineffective leadership and the rise of extremism threaten not only the party itself but also the fabric of our democracy. Individuals such as Marjorie Taylor Greene Ted Cruz Donald Trump JD Vance Lauren Boebert Jim Jordan and others including Supreme Court justices aligned with the MAGA movement exemplify this troubling trend.  Many key figures from Donald Trump‚Äôs first administration are either imprisoned or have turned against him. This alarming trend should make us question the integrity and stability of his leadership. Do we really want to entrust our future to someone with such a troubling track record?  At this pivotal moment in our nation‚Äôs history it is imperative to address these challenges with clarity and resolve. The actions and rhetoric of these figures have fueled division and eroded trust in our democratic institutions. Their embrace of conspiracy theories their attacks on established norms and their refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of fair elections undermine the very foundations of our democracy.  To safeguard our future we must prioritize the restoration of integrity competence and unity within the political process. This begins with holding accountable those who prioritize personal gain over the public good. By voting out individuals who perpetuate division and misinformation we can reclaim the spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation essential for effective governance.  Moreover the Republican Party itself stands at a crossroads. It has the opportunity to redefine its identity and regain credibility by rejecting extremism and embracing responsible leadership. Voters have a crucial role in shaping this transformation by supporting candidates committed to upholding democratic values and advancing policies that benefit all Americans.  In essence the urgency of this moment demands a collective commitment to reject the politics of fear and division. We must instead champion leaders who prioritize facts accountability and the common good. By doing so we can foster a political environment where constructive dialogue thrives compromise is possible and progress is achievable.  Ultimately the decision rests with each voter to safeguard our democratic principles. By electing leaders who embody integrity and inclusivity we can ensure that our government reflects the will of the people and serves the interests of all Americans. This election is not merely about partisan politics; it is about preserving the fundamental values that define us as a nation.  Let us seize this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to democracy and reject those seeking to undermine it. Together we can forge a path that honors our past strengthens our present and secures a brighter future for future generations.,2024-07-09 18:59:15 GMT

Should I repeat this poll to my readers or will doing so reveal that we are completely out of touch with the electorate and basically everything they‚Äôve been telling us for the past decade?‚Äù  This was one of those times.   There has not been a VP as derided by the media as Harris has been since Dan Quayle. The attacks have been personal uncalled-for and ridiculous coming from Twitter accounts columns commentary and articles of supposedly impartial and even left-leaning journalists. And there has not been a candidate as relentlessly and unfairly attacked for so long by national media in my entire lifetime as Hillary Clinton.   Our elite national political writers broadcasters and editors are salivating over the chance to attack either of these candidates and to do so with punches that they simply cannot land on Biden.   Only Democrats worry about appealing to the opposing party and the uninterested by bringing in a so-called ‚Äúelectable‚Äù candidate and the milquetoast options that ludicrous approach has brought us has consistently led to losses in winnable elections. Watching Democratic indecisiveness over candidates and policies is an endless source of frustration and it correctly (in my view) builds the image of the American left as weak and disloyal. Stick to your guns people for once in your wishy-washy lives choose a path stay on it and stop taking the bait offered up by pundits who clearly want you to lose.   The ticket is Biden-Harris.

Internal discord ineffective leadership and the rise of extremism threaten not only the party itself but also the fabric of our democracy. Individuals such as Marjorie Taylor Greene Ted Cruz Donald Trump JD Vance Lauren Boebert Jim Jordan and others including Supreme Court justices aligned with the MAGA movement exemplify this troubling trend.  Many key figures from Donald Trump‚Äôs first administration are either imprisoned or have turned against him. This alarming trend should make us question the integrity and stability of his leadership. Do we really want to entrust our future to someone with such a troubling track record?  At this pivotal moment in our nation‚Äôs history it is imperative to address these challenges with clarity and resolve. The actions and rhetoric of these figures have fueled division and eroded trust in our democratic institutions. Their embrace of conspiracy theories their attacks on established norms and their refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of fair elections undermine the very foundations of our democracy.  To safeguard our future we must prioritize the restoration of integrity competence and unity within the political process. This begins with holding accountable those who prioritize personal gain over the public good. By voting out individuals who perpetuate division and misinformation we can reclaim the spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation essential for effective governance.  Moreover the Republican Party itself stands at a crossroads. It has the opportunity to redefine its identity and regain credibility by rejecting extremism and embracing responsible leadership. Voters have a crucial role in shaping this transformation by supporting candidates committed to upholding democratic values and advancing policies that benefit all Americans.  In essence the urgency of this moment demands a collective commitment to reject the politics of fear and division. We must instead champion leaders who prioritize facts accountability and the common good. By doing so we can foster a political environment where constructive dialogue thrives compromise is possible and progress is achievable.  Ultimately the decision rests with each voter to safeguard our democratic principles. By electing leaders who embody integrity and inclusivity we can ensure that our government reflects the will of the people and serves the interests of all Americans. This election is not merely about partisan politics; it is about preserving the fundamental values that define us as a nation.  Let us seize this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to democracy and reject those seeking to undermine it. Together we can forge a path that honors our past strengthens our present and secures a brighter future for future generations.,2024-07-09 18:59:15 GMT

Donald J Trump is arguably the most ignorant disgusting demented man that anyone in America can name. Why are Democrats news pundits and internet morons continuing to talk about Biden being old?  Donald Trump tried to overthrow the government of the United States of America and lost over 60 lawsuits to that effect. He incited and supported an insurrection that saw Americans attack the Capitol and try to capture or kill American lawmakers.  Who the fuck cares if Biden is old?  Donald J Trump named three Supreme Court Justices who ended Roe v Wade and have now rendered the Separation of Powers and check and balances in the US Constitution as ‚Äúnull and void.‚Äù  Biden is just 3 years older than Trump and who cares?  Donald Trump goes on insane meandering half-baked rants at political rallies slurring his words unable to complete sentences losing track of his thoughts and calling for Americans to be hurt have their rights taken away and worse. He treats everyone around him including other Republicans like trash.  But Biden is old.  Donald Trump pretended that COVID was a hoax suggested the American people ingest bleach to fight it and smeared the leading scientists battling COVID which resulted in about a million deaths in the United States in a year.  But Joe Biden is pretty old.  Donald Trump was accused of rape by over 20 women found guilty of sexual assault in 2024 and made lurid comments about his own daughter. He also cheated on all three of his wives including his latest wife while she was pregnant. Then he tried to cover it up by paying hush money to a porn star.  Biden is an old guy.  Donald Trump banned Muslims from America put thousands of people in cages at the border and tried to get the Ukrainian president to lie about Joe Biden.   But Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a youngin anymore.  Trump said African nations were ‚Äúshithole countries‚Äù and said white supremacists were ‚Äúvery fine people.‚Äù Trump said immigrants were taking ‚ÄúBlack jobs‚Äù. He also ignored the hurricane catastrophe in Puerto Rico which took 3000 lives.  But Biden is old.  Trump‚Äôs family foundation was found to have ripped off charities he‚Äôs banned from doing business in New York and his daughter and son-in-law received $2 billion from the Saudis at the end of his presidency. He‚Äôs bankrupted or failed in every business he‚Äôs ever had from Trump Steaks to Trump Air to Trump University to all the casinos.  But hey Biden is old.  Trump did a deal with Afghanistan to let the Taliban out of prison so they could (and did) take over the country. He‚Äôs sided with Putin against NATO. He said nothing about the Saudis killing a journalist. Donald Trump eased restrictions on loan sharks exploded the deficit and made friends with North Korea. He told over 3000 lies.

By electing leaders who embody integrity and inclusivity we can ensure that our government reflects the will of the people and serves the interests of all Americans. This election is not merely about partisan politics; it is about preserving the fundamental values that define us as a nation.  Let us seize this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to democracy and reject those seeking to undermine it. Together we can forge a path that honors our past strengthens our present and secures a brighter future for future generations.,2024-07-09 18:59:15 GMT

Because why would he?  One thing I don‚Äôt think a lot of people fully appreciate is that the stakes are pretty damn high here for him too. First because his entire reputation and legacy are on the line. Even if he were driven solely by ego and ambition he has to know that a loss to Trump would destroy his legacy. If he had chosen to be a one-term President he‚Äôd probably be remembered by his supporters as a relatively harmless if perhaps not very significant President come what may. But if he loses now it will be forever presumed (rightly or wrongly) that his age and his refusal to drop out doomed America and the world.  Then there is the actual physical danger. Not only the hardship stress and exhaustion of the job itself but the fact that this is not a normal election and his opponent is not a normal candidate. If Biden loses his opponents have made it quite clear that they intend to abuse the Presidency (which thanks to SCOTUS now has near-unlimited power) to prosecute him. His son is already potentially facing prison time on charges that while not entirely without factual basis are also clearly politically-driven. Biden has rightly kept his oath of office and not interfered on his son‚Äôs behalf and made it clear that he will not pardon Hunter Biden. But he has to know that his son will be treated more harshly under a Trump DOJ.  When you‚Äôre 81 years old and you‚Äôre the most powerful man on Earth what do you have to work toward in the future? You‚Äôve climbed about as high as a person can and you probably don‚Äôt have that many years left. Beyond hoping for a few years of comfortable retirement (something Biden has put off to run again) there are really only two things to look forward to in a selfish sense: what sort of legacy you will leave behind and what will happen to your family when you‚Äôre gone. All of those are now on the line for Biden.

1,Joe Biden,['blacklivesmatter'  'ados'  'blackvotersmatters'  'donald trump'  'naacp'  'blackmediamatters'  'blackvotersmatter'  'news'  'youtube'],rauthschild,I dedicate this to all the members of the National Bar Association American Bar Association Attorney Generals Assistant Attorney Generals District Attorneys Prosecutors; and Federal State County and City Black Judges and Lawyers Collectively Illusional Criminals.  The following brief case commentary from the United States Supreme Court (the Federal Republic Court in 1805) comes from a Memorandum of Law written by the John Trowbridge in which he is at pains to explain the difference between confederate states (States of America) operating the Federal Republic under The Constitution for the united States of America and the District States created by General Washington as administrative units of the Territorial District of Columbia Government and all of these ‚Äústates‚Äù versus the Territories and Possessions of the United States known as the ‚ÄúInsular States‚Äù:   ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court explains the political distinction between on the one hand the members of the Union and on the other the District of Columbia and the territories:  &quot;On the part of the plaintiffs it has been urged that Columbia is a distinct political society and is therefore ‚Äúa state‚Äù according to the definitions of writers on general law.  This is true. But as the act of Congress obviously uses the word ‚Äústate‚Äù in reference to the term as used in the Constitution it becomes necessary to inquire whether Columbia is a state in the sense of that instrument.   The result of that examination is a conviction that the members of the American confederacy only are the states contemplated in the Constitution.  ‚Ä¶ These clauses show that the word ‚Äústate‚Äù is used in the Constitution as designating a member of the union of the original Confederation doing business as the States of America and excludes from the term the signification attached to it by writers on the law of nations.&quot;   Underline and boldface emphasis added. Hepburn &amp; Dundas v. Ellzey 6 U.S. 445 452 2 Cranch 445 2 L.Ed. 332 (1805).  &quot;It has been attempted to distinguish a Territory from the district sic of Columbia; but the court is of opinion that this distinction cannot be maintained.  They may differ in many respects but neither of them is a state in the sense in which that term is used in the constitution.‚Äù    Emphasis added. New Orleans v. Winter 1 Wheat. (U. S.) 91 4 L. Ed. 44 (1816).  These are definitive findings of the actual Federal Republic Supreme Court having the proper jurisdiction to decide these issues and what we herein discover is that:   The various kinds of ‚Äúterritories‚Äù either created administratively by the district of Columbia or arising as natural properties (Insular States) are not the ‚Äústates‚Äù referenced in the Constitution.   The ‚Äústates‚Äù in the Constitution being referenced in 1805 are the Confederate states that is ‚Äústates of state‚Äù that were members of the American Confederation formed in 1781 and known as ‚Äúthe American Confederacy‚Äù long before Jefferson Davis was born.   This all makes sense as the American States of States were the members of the States of America ‚Äì that is the Confederation ‚Äì awarded the Federal Constitution known as ‚ÄúThe Constitution for the united States of America‚Äù in 1787.   Secondly neither the district of Columbia nor the Territories attached to it are ‚Äústates‚Äù of this kind.   As we put it in our second International Public Notice addressed to Derek Johnson George Washington created District States not state districts; the government of the district called ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù is distinct and its ‚Äústates‚Äù are distinct both from the Confederate states and the United States Territories even though all three might meet the definition of ‚Äústate‚Äù contemplated more generally under international law.   These two Supreme Court cases tell us that within the purview of the Constitution forming the Federal Republic the only ‚Äústates‚Äù contemplated are the members of the original American Confederacy.   This distinction explains how we have (1) an American Federal Subcontractor dba States of America and its states which are members of the American Confederacy and (2) a district of Columbia Subcontractor and its territories (District States) which are not ‚Äústates‚Äù within the meaning of the Federal Constitution and (3) separate United States Territories and Possessions which are not ‚Äústates‚Äù in this context either.  Now you can better contemplate the complexity of the original Federal Government structure and discern how the use of the word ‚Äústate‚Äù was contextually used to mean some states and not others.   For Constitutional purposes the word ‚Äústate‚Äù refers to the Confederate states belonging to the ‚ÄúStates of America‚Äù the doing-business-as name of the original Confederation formed in 1781 which was awarded The Constitution for the united States of America in 1787. This is the Federal Government known as the Federal Republic.   In the original Federal Constitution (1787) the word ‚Äústate‚Äù does not refer to the District States set up by George Washington to administer the district of Columbia and its territories (1789 Constitution) nor does it refer to the United States Territories and Possessions as ‚Äústates‚Äù (1790 Constitution).  To summarize:  (1) We have the Union States that occupy the national soil jurisdiction of each nation-state.   (2) We have the Federation States that occupy the international land and sea jurisdiction belonging to each nation-state and the members of the Federation called States of the Union.   (3) We had the Confederate States (States-of-States) that were members of the original 1781 Confederation that occupied the global air jurisdiction belonging to each nation-state and which were known jointly as ‚Äúthe American Confederacy‚Äù.   (4) We had the above-mentioned Confederation doing business as the States of America and operating the Federal Republic under the 1787 Constitution for the united States of America until 1861 when the American Confederacy lost the necessary quorum to conduct business; at which point the individual ‚ÄúFederal Republics‚Äù operated as another form of ‚Äústates‚Äù also failed.   (5) We still have the District States arising under the Northwest Ordinance and territories of the district of Columbia sometimes called ‚ÄúFederal enclaves‚Äù or Federal Management Units Judicial Districts Military Districts etc.   (6) We still have the United States Territories and Possessions sometimes called ‚Äúthe Insular States‚Äù.   All of six of these governmental entities three American and three Federal have given rise to ‚Äústates‚Äù and it behooves us to know this and to know that the general meaning of ‚Äústates‚Äù accepted by the Law of Nations is not used in Federal Codes and documents; since early on each document or Act of Congress defines the word ‚Äústate‚Äù as a legal term for the purposes of that document treaty or code.   You can now see why this is necessary.  Our Union States and our States of the Union have never stood under any Constitution.   The American Federation of States that the ‚ÄúFederal Government‚Äù is named after delegated the ‚Äúenumerated powers‚Äù to the Federal Subcontractors.   The Federation could never stand under any Constitution as a result of this role and neither could its member States.   The only form of American ‚ÄúState‚Äù to subject themselves and their Confederation to service under a Constitution were the original Confederate States of America (1781 to 1861) and these were all ‚ÄúStates of States‚Äù ‚Äì separate organizations in the business of providing governmental services under contract.   None of these above referenced &quot;states&quot; known as the Union States or as the States of the Union nor as the original Confederate States were of any Territorial origin. They were (in the case of the Confederacy) or are (in the case of the Union States and Federation States) of uniquely American origin.   The District (that is Territorial) States are a different story and arise on paper as a result of duties owed by the British Territorial Subcontractors under the Northwest Ordinance.  Likewise the so-called Insular States Puerto Rico Guam American Samoa et alia are known as territorial states and possessions of the United States.   All this tangled history all these various kinds of ‚Äústates‚Äù ‚Äì both those currently existing and those that are ‚Äúmissing‚Äù and awaiting reconstruction ‚Äì have to be separately known and acknowledged and defined their powers and relationships accounted for or it is literally impossible to know what you mean by ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù or ‚ÄúStates of America‚Äù or ‚ÄúUnited States of America‚Äù.   The later incorporation of the British Territorial version of ‚Äúthe United States of America‚Äù to create ‚Äúthe United States of America ‚Äì Incorporated‚Äù added another layer of complexity as we must additionally distinguish between incorporated and unincorporated ‚Äústates‚Äù.   Still later the Municipal Government of the United States also incorporated Municipal Corporations named after our States distinguished as STATES which are foreign Municipal Corporations.   These additional incorporated ‚Äústates‚Äù and ‚Äústates of states‚Äù just muddy the water more and cause more confusion and these are business entities only arising on paper; they are owned and operated by the Federal Subcontractors not the American people.   Bottom line: we have been feloniously impersonated and so have our Autochthonous States of the Union.   We have been ‚Äúassumed‚Äù to be responsible for the debts and outrages of these foreign corporations and their ‚Äústates‚Äù without our knowledge or consent.   We have been ‚Äúpresumed to acquiesce‚Äù to their activities apportioning themselves new rights new roles and new empowerments including but not limited to more than fifteen unilateral and unratified (by our States) Amendments to their service contracts and endless drafts against our credit and the unregulated enforcement of vast quantities of new Federal Code representing impositions that were never granted to them via any contract.   Let it be known that these Subcontractors never consulted nor fully informed their employers of their actions and presumptions and never bothered to actually implement the remedies published as a means to legalize their theft of American property.  This leads to the inevitable conclusion that these foreign Employees working as Federal Subcontractors used the plethora of confusions related to the kind and nature of ‚Äústates‚Äù and the absence of the American Confederacy after the Civil War to promote a mammoth and secretive fraud scheme against their actual Employers.   The absence of the American Confederacy in no way excuses their obligations owed to the American People and to the States of the Union and the Union States.   The absence of the American Confederacy doesn‚Äôt grant them any additional contracts or special powers. It doesn‚Äôt elevate or change the nature of their ‚Äústates‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt ratify all the unratified ‚ÄúAmendments‚Äù they have unilaterally made to their own service contracts. It doesn‚Äôt allow them to declare war. It doesn‚Äôt allow them to impersonate Americans as ‚ÄúFederal Citizens‚Äù via undisclosed and unconscionable registrations and enrollments and enlistments. It doesn‚Äôt allow them to impersonate our Federation of States as a foreign incorporated entity.   The American Confederacy was never their Employer and its duties were never vouchsafed to them.   Their gross failure to fully inform the Federation of States that delegated their ‚Äúpowers‚Äù to them and their subsequent criminal activities resulting in gross harm to their employers speak for themselves.   These ‚ÄúFederal Corporations‚Äù have been operating as rogue ‚Äústates‚Äù ‚Äì and they are not ‚Äústates‚Äù of ours.   We have only by dint of our own hard work and investigation determined what these foreign entities have done ‚Äúin our names‚Äù and falsely alleged against our country and our people. No disclosure was provided to us or to our States of the Union by these criminal miscreants who are the responsibility of the Pope and His Imperial Majesty ‚ÄúKing‚Äù Charles and the Lord Mayor of London.   There is no contract or agreement allowing our Federal Subcontractors to promote a Mercenary Conflict on our shores and the continuation of this illegal and immoral nonsense for 164 years in view of the fact that both these organizations are ultimately owned and operated by the Pope ‚Äì directly in the case of the Municipal Corporations and indirectly through his Commonwealth Overseer in the case of the Territorial Corporations ‚Äî is purely criminal.   The Popes and the British Monarchs and the Governors and Mayors of Westminster have owed us good faith service throughout the duration of this self-interested crime spree and they have fraudulently pretended to be our protectors allies and custodians throughout this criminal rampage of predation and impersonation racketeering human trafficking and political usurpation.   The shame and the bill is entirely on them.,2024-07-09 22:18:05 GMT

Donald J Trump is arguably the most ignorant disgusting demented man that anyone in America can name. Why are Democrats news pundits and internet morons continuing to talk about Biden being old?  Donald Trump tried to overthrow the government of the United States of America and lost over 60 lawsuits to that effect. He incited and supported an insurrection that saw Americans attack the Capitol and try to capture or kill American lawmakers.  Who the fuck cares if Biden is old?  Donald J Trump named three Supreme Court Justices who ended Roe v Wade and have now rendered the Separation of Powers and check and balances in the US Constitution as ‚Äúnull and void.‚Äù  Biden is just 3 years older than Trump and who cares?  Donald Trump goes on insane meandering half-baked rants at political rallies slurring his words unable to complete sentences losing track of his thoughts and calling for Americans to be hurt have their rights taken away and worse. He treats everyone around him including other Republicans like trash.  But Biden is old.  Donald Trump pretended that COVID was a hoax suggested the American people ingest bleach to fight it and smeared the leading scientists battling COVID which resulted in about a million deaths in the United States in a year.  But Joe Biden is pretty old.  Donald Trump was accused of rape by over 20 women found guilty of sexual assault in 2024 and made lurid comments about his own daughter. He also cheated on all three of his wives including his latest wife while she was pregnant. Then he tried to cover it up by paying hush money to a porn star.  Biden is an old guy.  Donald Trump banned Muslims from America put thousands of people in cages at the border and tried to get the Ukrainian president to lie about Joe Biden.   But Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a youngin anymore.  Trump said African nations were ‚Äúshithole countries‚Äù and said white supremacists were ‚Äúvery fine people.‚Äù Trump said immigrants were taking ‚ÄúBlack jobs‚Äù. He also ignored the hurricane catastrophe in Puerto Rico which took 3000 lives.  But Biden is old.  Trump‚Äôs family foundation was found to have ripped off charities he‚Äôs banned from doing business in New York and his daughter and son-in-law received $2 billion from the Saudis at the end of his presidency. He‚Äôs bankrupted or failed in every business he‚Äôs ever had from Trump Steaks to Trump Air to Trump University to all the casinos.  But hey Biden is old.  Trump did a deal with Afghanistan to let the Taliban out of prison so they could (and did) take over the country. He‚Äôs sided with Putin against NATO. He said nothing about the Saudis killing a journalist. Donald Trump eased restrictions on loan sharks exploded the deficit and made friends with North Korea. He told over 3000 lies.   But old Joe is old.  Biden is old.  Donald Trump is easily the worst human being anyone has ever encountered and all anyone can talk about is how old Biden is.

Secondly neither the district of Columbia nor the Territories attached to it are ‚Äústates‚Äù of this kind.   As we put it in our second International Public Notice addressed to Derek Johnson George Washington created District States not state districts; the government of the district called ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù is distinct and its ‚Äústates‚Äù are distinct both from the Confederate states and the United States Territories even though all three might meet the definition of ‚Äústate‚Äù contemplated more generally under international law.   These two Supreme Court cases tell us that within the purview of the Constitution forming the Federal Republic the only ‚Äústates‚Äù contemplated are the members of the original American Confederacy.   This distinction explains how we have (1) an American Federal Subcontractor dba States of America and its states which are members of the American Confederacy and (2) a district of Columbia Subcontractor and its territories (District States) which are not ‚Äústates‚Äù within the meaning of the Federal Constitution and (3) separate United States Territories and Possessions which are not ‚Äústates‚Äù in this context either.  Now you can better contemplate the complexity of the original Federal Government structure and discern how the use of the word ‚Äústate‚Äù was contextually used to mean some states and not others.   For Constitutional purposes the word ‚Äústate‚Äù refers to the Confederate states belonging to the ‚ÄúStates of America‚Äù the doing-business-as name of the original Confederation formed in 1781 which was awarded The Constitution for the united States of America in 1787. This is the Federal Government known as the Federal Republic.   In the original Federal Constitution (1787) the word ‚Äústate‚Äù does not refer to the District States set up by George Washington to administer the district of Columbia and its territories (1789 Constitution) nor does it refer to the United States Territories and Possessions as ‚Äústates‚Äù (1790 Constitution).  To summarize:  (1) We have the Union States that occupy the national soil jurisdiction of each nation-state.   (2) We have the Federation States that occupy the international land and sea jurisdiction belonging to each nation-state and the members of the Federation called States of the Union.   (3) We had the Confederate States (States-of-States) that were members of the original 1781 Confederation that occupied the global air jurisdiction belonging to each nation-state and which were known jointly as ‚Äúthe American Confederacy‚Äù.   (4) We had the above-mentioned Confederation doing business as the States of America and operating the Federal Republic under the 1787 Constitution for the united States of America until 1861 when the American Confederacy lost the necessary quorum to conduct business; at which point the individual ‚ÄúFederal Republics‚Äù operated as another form of ‚Äústates‚Äù also failed.   (5) We still have the District States arising under the Northwest Ordinance and territories of the district of Columbia sometimes called ‚ÄúFederal enclaves‚Äù or Federal Management Units Judicial Districts Military Districts etc.   (6) We still have the United States Territories and Possessions sometimes called ‚Äúthe Insular States‚Äù.   All of six of these governmental entities three American and three Federal have given rise to ‚Äústates‚Äù and it behooves us to know this and to know that the general meaning of ‚Äústates‚Äù accepted by the Law of Nations is not used in Federal Codes and documents; since early on each document or Act of Congress defines the word ‚Äústate‚Äù as a legal term for the purposes of that document treaty or code.   You can now see why this is necessary.  Our Union States and our States of the Union have never stood under any Constitution.   The American Federation of States that the ‚ÄúFederal Government‚Äù is named after delegated the ‚Äúenumerated powers‚Äù to the Federal Subcontractors.   The Federation could never stand under any Constitution as a result of this role and neither could its member States.   The only form of American ‚ÄúState‚Äù to subject themselves and their Confederation to service under a Constitution were the original Confederate States of America (1781 to 1861) and these were all ‚ÄúStates of States‚Äù ‚Äì separate organizations in the business of providing governmental services under contract.   None of these above referenced &quot;states&quot; known as the Union States or as the States of the Union nor as the original Confederate States were of any Territorial origin. They were (in the case of the Confederacy) or are (in the case of the Union States and Federation States) of uniquely American origin.   The District (that is Territorial) States are a different story and arise on paper as a result of duties owed by the British Territorial Subcontractors under the Northwest Ordinance.  Likewise the so-called Insular States Puerto Rico Guam American Samoa et alia are known as territorial states and possessions of the United States.   All this tangled history all these various kinds of ‚Äústates‚Äù ‚Äì both those currently existing and those that are ‚Äúmissing‚Äù and awaiting reconstruction ‚Äì have to be separately known and acknowledged and defined their powers and relationships accounted for or it is literally impossible to know what you mean by ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù or ‚ÄúStates of America‚Äù or ‚ÄúUnited States of America‚Äù.   The later incorporation of the British Territorial version of ‚Äúthe United States of America‚Äù to create ‚Äúthe United States of America ‚Äì Incorporated‚Äù added another layer of complexity as we must additionally distinguish between incorporated and unincorporated ‚Äústates‚Äù.   Still later the Municipal Government of the United States also incorporated Municipal Corporations named after our States distinguished as STATES which are foreign Municipal Corporations.   These additional incorporated ‚Äústates‚Äù and ‚Äústates of states‚Äù just muddy the water more and cause more confusion and these are business entities only arising on paper; they are owned and operated by the Federal Subcontractors not the American people.   Bottom line: we have been feloniously impersonated and so have our Autochthonous States of the Union.   We have been ‚Äúassumed‚Äù to be responsible for the debts and outrages of these foreign corporations and their ‚Äústates‚Äù without our knowledge or consent.   We have been ‚Äúpresumed to acquiesce‚Äù to their activities apportioning themselves new rights new roles and new empowerments including but not limited to more than fifteen unilateral and unratified (by our States) Amendments to their service contracts and endless drafts against our credit and the unregulated enforcement of vast quantities of new Federal Code representing impositions that were never granted to them via any contract.   Let it be known that these Subcontractors never consulted nor fully informed their employers of their actions and presumptions and never bothered to actually implement the remedies published as a means to legalize their theft of American property.  This leads to the inevitable conclusion that these foreign Employees working as Federal Subcontractors used the plethora of confusions related to the kind and nature of ‚Äústates‚Äù and the absence of the American Confederacy after the Civil War to promote a mammoth and secretive fraud scheme against their actual Employers.   The absence of the American Confederacy in no way excuses their obligations owed to the American People and to the States of the Union and the Union States.   The absence of the American Confederacy doesn‚Äôt grant them any additional contracts or special powers. It doesn‚Äôt elevate or change the nature of their ‚Äústates‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt ratify all the unratified ‚ÄúAmendments‚Äù they have unilaterally made to their own service contracts. It doesn‚Äôt allow them to declare war. It doesn‚Äôt allow them to impersonate Americans as ‚ÄúFederal Citizens‚Äù via undisclosed and unconscionable registrations and enrollments and enlistments. It doesn‚Äôt allow them to impersonate our Federation of States as a foreign incorporated entity.   The American Confederacy was never their Employer and its duties were never vouchsafed to them.   Their gross failure to fully inform the Federation of States that delegated their ‚Äúpowers‚Äù to them and their subsequent criminal activities resulting in gross harm to their employers speak for themselves.   These ‚ÄúFederal Corporations‚Äù have been operating as rogue ‚Äústates‚Äù ‚Äì and they are not ‚Äústates‚Äù of ours.   We have only by dint of our own hard work and investigation determined what these foreign entities have done ‚Äúin our names‚Äù and falsely alleged against our country and our people. No disclosure was provided to us or to our States of the Union by these criminal miscreants who are the responsibility of the Pope and His Imperial Majesty ‚ÄúKing‚Äù Charles and the Lord Mayor of London.   There is no contract or agreement allowing our Federal Subcontractors to promote a Mercenary Conflict on our shores and the continuation of this illegal and immoral nonsense for 164 years in view of the fact that both these organizations are ultimately owned and operated by the Pope ‚Äì directly in the case of the Municipal Corporations and indirectly through his Commonwealth Overseer in the case of the Territorial Corporations ‚Äî is purely criminal.   The Popes and the British Monarchs and the Governors and Mayors of Westminster have owed us good faith service throughout the duration of this self-interested crime spree and they have fraudulently pretended to be our protectors allies and custodians throughout this criminal rampage of predation and impersonation racketeering human trafficking and political usurpation.   The shame and the bill is entirely on them.,2024-07-09 22:18:05 GMT

295,Joe Biden,['politics'  'fuck trump'  'vote blue'  'vote democrat'],reading-writing-revolution,What The Fuck is Wrong with You? Elect Biden and shut the fuck up about his age.  Donald J Trump is arguably the most ignorant disgusting demented man that anyone in America can name. Why are Democrats news pundits and internet morons continuing to talk about Biden being old?  Donald Trump tried to overthrow the government of the United States of America and lost over 60 lawsuits to that effect. He incited and supported an insurrection that saw Americans attack the Capitol and try to capture or kill American lawmakers.  Who the fuck cares if Biden is old?  Donald J Trump named three Supreme Court Justices who ended Roe v Wade and have now rendered the Separation of Powers and check and balances in the US Constitution as ‚Äúnull and void.‚Äù  Biden is just 3 years older than Trump and who cares?  Donald Trump goes on insane meandering half-baked rants at political rallies slurring his words unable to complete sentences losing track of his thoughts and calling for Americans to be hurt have their rights taken away and worse. He treats everyone around him including other Republicans like trash.  But Biden is old.  Donald Trump pretended that COVID was a hoax suggested the American people ingest bleach to fight it and smeared the leading scientists battling COVID which resulted in about a million deaths in the United States in a year.  But Joe Biden is pretty old.  Donald Trump was accused of rape by over 20 women found guilty of sexual assault in 2024 and made lurid comments about his own daughter. He also cheated on all three of his wives including his latest wife while she was pregnant. Then he tried to cover it up by paying hush money to a porn star.  Biden is an old guy.  Donald Trump banned Muslims from America put thousands of people in cages at the border and tried to get the Ukrainian president to lie about Joe Biden.   But Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a youngin anymore.  Trump said African nations were ‚Äúshithole countries‚Äù and said white supremacists were ‚Äúvery fine people.‚Äù Trump said immigrants were taking ‚ÄúBlack jobs‚Äù. He also ignored the hurricane catastrophe in Puerto Rico which took 3000 lives.  But Biden is old.  Trump‚Äôs family foundation was found to have ripped off charities he‚Äôs banned from doing business in New York and his daughter and son-in-law received $2 billion from the Saudis at the end of his presidency. He‚Äôs bankrupted or failed in every business he‚Äôs ever had from Trump Steaks to Trump Air to Trump University to all the casinos.  But hey Biden is old.  Trump did a deal with Afghanistan to let the Taliban out of prison so they could (and did) take over the country. He‚Äôs sided with Putin against NATO. He said nothing about the Saudis killing a journalist. Donald Trump eased restrictions on loan sharks exploded the deficit and made friends with North Korea. He told over 3000 lies.   But old Joe is old.  Biden is old.  Donald Trump is easily the worst human being anyone has ever encountered and all anyone can talk about is how old Biden is.

We were walking around in the mountains or something when suddenly we saw these crystals over by a nearby cliff and they were softly exploding giving off a strange glow. Me and the girlfriend went to go explore while Trump stayed behind.  The girlfriend and I walked over to this cliff and looked around but now that we were up close couldn‚Äôt find any of the crystals! I looked back to where Trump was and saw him duck under a tent or something pulling it over him like a young boy playing hide and seek.

4,Joe Biden,['us'  'politics'  'election'  '2024'  "ridin' with biden"  'biden/harris 2024'  'vote'  'vote blue'],originalleftist,One thing I‚Äôll say is that I very much doubt Joe Biden would remain in the race if HE didn‚Äôt truly believe as he says that he can get it done. Because why would he?  One thing I don‚Äôt think a lot of people fully appreciate is that the stakes are pretty damn high here for him too. First because his entire reputation and legacy are on the line. Even if he were driven solely by ego and ambition he has to know that a loss to Trump would destroy his legacy. If he had chosen to be a one-term President he‚Äôd probably be remembered by his supporters as a relatively harmless if perhaps not very significant President come what may. But if he loses now it will be forever presumed (rightly or wrongly) that his age and his refusal to drop out doomed America and the world.  Then there is the actual physical danger. Not only the hardship stress and exhaustion of the job itself but the fact that this is not a normal election and his opponent is not a normal candidate. If Biden loses his opponents have made it quite clear that they intend to abuse the Presidency (which thanks to SCOTUS now has near-unlimited power) to prosecute him. His son is already potentially facing prison time on charges that while not entirely without factual basis are also clearly politically-driven. Biden has rightly kept his oath of office and not interfered on his son‚Äôs behalf and made it clear that he will not pardon Hunter Biden. But he has to know that his son will be treated more harshly under a Trump DOJ.  When you‚Äôre 81 years old and you‚Äôre the most powerful man on Earth what do you have to work toward in the future? You‚Äôve climbed about as high as a person can and you probably don‚Äôt have that many years left. Beyond hoping for a few years of comfortable retirement (something Biden has put off to run again) there are really only two things to look forward to in a selfish sense: what sort of legacy you will leave behind and what will happen to your family when you‚Äôre gone. All of those are now on the line for Biden. So yes I absolutely do not believe he would be doing this if he didn‚Äôt think he could pull it off because he has as much skin in the game as anyone.,2024-07-09 22:28:28 GMT
1,Joe Biden,['blacklivesmatter'  'ados'  'blackvotersmatters'  'donald trump'  'naacp'  'blackmediamatters'  'blackvotersmatter'  'news'  'youtube'],rauthschild,I dedicate this to all the members of the National Bar Association American Bar Association Attorney Generals Assistant Attorney Generals District Attorneys Prosecutors; and Federal State County and City Black Judges and Lawyers Collectively Illusional Criminals.  The following brief case commentary from the United States Supreme Court (the Federal Republic Court in 1805) comes from a Memorandum of Law written by the John Trowbridge in which he is at pains to explain the difference between confederate states (States of America) operating the Federal Republic under The Constitution for the united States of America and the District States created by General Washington as administrative units of the Territorial District of Columbia Government and all of these ‚Äústates‚Äù versus the Territories and Possessions of the United States known as the ‚ÄúInsular States‚Äù:   ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court explains the political distinction between on the one hand the members of the Union and on the other the District of Columbia and the territories:  &quot;On the part of the plaintiffs it has been urged that Columbia is a distinct political society and is therefore ‚Äúa state‚Äù according to the definitions of writers on general law.  This is true. But as the act of Congress obviously uses the word ‚Äústate‚Äù in reference to the term as used in the Constitution it becomes necessary to inquire whether Columbia is a state in the sense of that instrument.   The result of that examination is a conviction that the members of the American confederacy only are the states contemplated in the Constitution.  ‚Ä¶ These clauses show that the word ‚Äústate‚Äù is used in the Constitution as designating a member of the union of the original Confederation doing business as the States of America and excludes from the term the signification attached to it by writers on the law of nations.&quot;   Underline and boldface emphasis added. Hepburn &amp; Dundas v. Ellzey 6 U.S. 445 452 2 Cranch 445 2 L.Ed. 332 (1805).  &quot;It has been attempted to distinguish a Territory from the district sic of Columbia; but the court is of opinion that this distinction cannot be maintained.  They may differ in many respects but neither of them is a state in the sense in which that term is used in the constitution.‚Äù    Emphasis added. New Orleans v. Winter 1 Wheat. (U. S.) 91 4 L. Ed. 44 (1816).  These are definitive findings of the actual Federal Republic Supreme Court having the proper jurisdiction to decide these issues and what we herein discover is that:   The various kinds of ‚Äúterritories‚Äù either created administratively by the district of Columbia or arising as natural properties (Insular States) are not the ‚Äústates‚Äù referenced in the Constitution.   The ‚Äústates‚Äù in the Constitution being referenced in 1805 are the Confederate states that is ‚Äústates of state‚Äù that were members of the American Confederation formed in 1781 and known as ‚Äúthe American Confederacy‚Äù long before Jefferson Davis was born.   This all makes sense as the American States of States were the members of the States of America ‚Äì that is the Confederation ‚Äì awarded the Federal Constitution known as ‚ÄúThe Constitution for the united States of America‚Äù in 1787.   Secondly neither the district of Columbia nor the Territories attached to it are ‚Äústates‚Äù of this kind.   As we put it in our second International Public Notice addressed to Derek Johnson George Washington created District States not state districts; the government of the district called ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù is distinct and its ‚Äústates‚Äù are distinct both from the Confederate states and the United States Territories even though all three might meet the definition of ‚Äústate‚Äù contemplated more generally under international law.

295,Joe Biden,['politics'  'fuck trump'  'vote blue'  'vote democrat'],reading-writing-revolution,What The Fuck is Wrong with You? Elect Biden and shut the fuck up about his age.  Donald J Trump is arguably the most ignorant disgusting demented man that anyone in America can name. Why are Democrats news pundits and internet morons continuing to talk about Biden being old?  Donald Trump tried to overthrow the government of the United States of America and lost over 60 lawsuits to that effect. He incited and supported an insurrection that saw Americans attack the Capitol and try to capture or kill American lawmakers.  Who the fuck cares if Biden is old?  Donald J Trump named three Supreme Court Justices who ended Roe v Wade and have now rendered the Separation of Powers and check and balances in the US Constitution as ‚Äúnull and void.‚Äù  Biden is just 3 years older than Trump and who cares?  Donald Trump goes on insane meandering half-baked rants at political rallies slurring his words unable to complete sentences losing track of his thoughts and calling for Americans to be hurt have their rights taken away and worse. He treats everyone around him including other Republicans like trash.  But Biden is old.  Donald Trump pretended that COVID was a hoax suggested the American people ingest bleach to fight it and smeared the leading scientists battling COVID which resulted in about a million deaths in the United States in a year.  But Joe Biden is pretty old.  Donald Trump was accused of rape by over 20 women found guilty of sexual assault in 2024 and made lurid comments about his own daughter. He also cheated on all three of his wives including his latest wife while she was pregnant. Then he tried to cover it up by paying hush money to a porn star.  Biden is an old guy.  Donald Trump banned Muslims from America put thousands of people in cages at the border and tried to get the Ukrainian president to lie about Joe Biden.   But Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a youngin anymore.  Trump said African nations were ‚Äúshithole countries‚Äù and said white supremacists were ‚Äúvery fine people.‚Äù Trump said immigrants were taking ‚ÄúBlack jobs‚Äù. He also ignored the hurricane catastrophe in Puerto Rico which took 3000 lives.  But Biden is old.  Trump‚Äôs family foundation was found to have ripped off charities he‚Äôs banned from doing business in New York and his daughter and son-in-law received $2 billion from the Saudis at the end of his presidency. He‚Äôs bankrupted or failed in every business he‚Äôs ever had from Trump Steaks to Trump Air to Trump University to all the casinos.  But hey Biden is old.  Trump did a deal with Afghanistan to let the Taliban out of prison so they could (and did) take over the country. He‚Äôs sided with Putin against NATO. He said nothing about the Saudis killing a journalist. Donald Trump eased restrictions on loan sharks exploded the deficit and made friends with North Korea. He told over 3000 lies.   But old Joe is old.  Biden is old.  Donald Trump is easily the worst human being anyone has ever encountered and all anyone can talk about is how old Biden is.

Hunter was there too! They all called me Smokey for some reason.

We were walking around in the mountains or something when suddenly we saw these crystals over by a nearby cliff and they were softly exploding giving off a strange glow. Me and the girlfriend went to go explore while Trump stayed behind.  The girlfriend and I walked over to this cliff and looked around but now that we were up close couldn‚Äôt find any of the crystals! I looked back to where Trump was and saw him duck under a tent or something pulling it over him like a young boy playing hide and seek.

4,Joe Biden,['us'  'politics'  'election'  '2024'  "ridin' with biden"  'biden/harris 2024'  'vote'  'vote blue'],originalleftist,One thing I‚Äôll say is that I very much doubt Joe Biden would remain in the race if HE didn‚Äôt truly believe as he says that he can get it done. Because why would he?  One thing I don‚Äôt think a lot of people fully appreciate is that the stakes are pretty damn high here for him too. First because his entire reputation and legacy are on the line. Even if he were driven solely by ego and ambition he has to know that a loss to Trump would destroy his legacy. If he had chosen to be a one-term President he‚Äôd probably be remembered by his supporters as a relatively harmless if perhaps not very significant President come what may. But if he loses now it will be forever presumed (rightly or wrongly) that his age and his refusal to drop out doomed America and the world.  Then there is the actual physical danger. Not only the hardship stress and exhaustion of the job itself but the fact that this is not a normal election and his opponent is not a normal candidate. If Biden loses his opponents have made it quite clear that they intend to abuse the Presidency (which thanks to SCOTUS now has near-unlimited power) to prosecute him. His son is already potentially facing prison time on charges that while not entirely without factual basis are also clearly politically-driven. Biden has rightly kept his oath of office and not interfered on his son‚Äôs behalf and made it clear that he will not pardon Hunter Biden. But he has to know that his son will be treated more harshly under a Trump DOJ.  When you‚Äôre 81 years old and you‚Äôre the most powerful man on Earth what do you have to work toward in the future? You‚Äôve climbed about as high as a person can and you probably don‚Äôt have that many years left. Beyond hoping for a few years of comfortable retirement (something Biden has put off to run again) there are really only two things to look forward to in a selfish sense: what sort of legacy you will leave behind and what will happen to your family when you‚Äôre gone. All of those are now on the line for Biden. So yes I absolutely do not believe he would be doing this if he didn‚Äôt think he could pull it off because he has as much skin in the game as anyone.,2024-07-09 22:28:28 GMT
1,Joe Biden,['blacklivesmatter'  'ados'  'blackvotersmatters'  'donald trump'  'naacp'  'blackmediamatters'  'blackvotersmatter'  'news'  'youtube'],rauthschild,I dedicate this to all the members of the National Bar Association American Bar Association Attorney Generals Assistant Attorney Generals District Attorneys Prosecutors; and Federal State County and City Black Judges and Lawyers Collectively Illusional Criminals.  The following brief case commentary from the United States Supreme Court (the Federal Republic Court in 1805) comes from a Memorandum of Law written by the John Trowbridge in which he is at pains to explain the difference between confederate states (States of America) operating the Federal Republic under The Constitution for the united States of America and the District States created by General Washington as administrative units of the Territorial District of Columbia Government and all of these ‚Äústates‚Äù versus the Territories and Possessions of the United States known as the ‚ÄúInsular States‚Äù:   ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court explains the political distinction between on the one hand the members of the Union and on the other the District of Columbia and the territories:  &quot;On the part of the plaintiffs it has been urged that Columbia is a distinct political society and is therefore ‚Äúa state‚Äù according to the definitions of writers on general law.  This is true. But as the act of Congress obviously uses the word ‚Äústate‚Äù in reference to the term as used in the Constitution it becomes necessary to inquire whether Columbia is a state in the sense of that instrument.   The result of that examination is a conviction that the members of the American confederacy only are the states contemplated in the Constitution.  ‚Ä¶ These clauses show that the word ‚Äústate‚Äù is used in the Constitution as designating a member of the union of the original Confederation doing business as the States of America and excludes from the term the signification attached to it by writers on the law of nations.&quot;   Underline and boldface emphasis added. Hepburn &amp; Dundas v. Ellzey 6 U.S. 445 452 2 Cranch 445 2 L.Ed. 332 (1805).  &quot;It has been attempted to distinguish a Territory from the district sic of Columbia; but the court is of opinion that this distinction cannot be maintained.  They may differ in many respects but neither of them is a state in the sense in which that term is used in the constitution.‚Äù    Emphasis added. New Orleans v. Winter 1 Wheat. (U. S.) 91 4 L. Ed. 44 (1816).  These are definitive findings of the actual Federal Republic Supreme Court having the proper jurisdiction to decide these issues and what we herein discover is that:   The various kinds of ‚Äúterritories‚Äù either created administratively by the district of Columbia or arising as natural properties (Insular States) are not the ‚Äústates‚Äù referenced in the Constitution.   The ‚Äústates‚Äù in the Constitution being referenced in 1805 are the Confederate states that is ‚Äústates of state‚Äù that were members of the American Confederation formed in 1781 and known as ‚Äúthe American Confederacy‚Äù long before Jefferson Davis was born.   This all makes sense as the American States of States were the members of the States of America ‚Äì that is the Confederation ‚Äì awarded the Federal Constitution known as ‚ÄúThe Constitution for the united States of America‚Äù in 1787.   Secondly neither the district of Columbia nor the Territories attached to it are ‚Äústates‚Äù of this kind.   As we put it in our second International Public Notice addressed to Derek Johnson George Washington created District States not state districts; the government of the district called ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù is distinct and its ‚Äústates‚Äù are distinct both from the Confederate states and the United States Territories even though all three might meet the definition of ‚Äústate‚Äù contemplated more generally under international law.   These two Supreme Court cases tell us that within the purview of the Constitution forming the Federal Republic the only ‚Äústates‚Äù contemplated are the members of the original American Confederacy.   This distinction explains how we have (1) an American Federal Subcontractor dba States of America and its states which are members of the American Confederacy and (2) a district of Columbia Subcontractor and its territories (District States) which are not ‚Äústates‚Äù within the meaning of the Federal Constitution and (3) separate United States Territories and Possessions which are not ‚Äústates‚Äù in this context either.  Now you can better contemplate the complexity of the original Federal Government structure and discern how the use of the word ‚Äústate‚Äù was contextually used to mean some states and not others.   For Constitutional purposes the word ‚Äústate‚Äù refers to the Confederate states belonging to the ‚ÄúStates of America‚Äù the doing-business-as name of the original Confederation formed in 1781 which was awarded The Constitution for the united States of America in 1787. This is the Federal Government known as the Federal Republic.   In the original Federal Constitution (1787) the word ‚Äústate‚Äù does not refer to the District States set up by George Washington to administer the district of Columbia and its territories (1789 Constitution) nor does it refer to the United States Territories and Possessions as ‚Äústates‚Äù (1790 Constitution).  To summarize:  (1) We have the Union States that occupy the national soil jurisdiction of each nation-state.   (2) We have the Federation States that occupy the international land and sea jurisdiction belonging to each nation-state and the members of the Federation called States of the Union.   (3) We had the Confederate States (States-of-States) that were members of the original 1781 Confederation that occupied the global air jurisdiction belonging to each nation-state and which were known jointly as ‚Äúthe American Confederacy‚Äù.   (4) We had the above-mentioned Confederation doing business as the States of America and operating the Federal Republic under the 1787 Constitution for the united States of America until 1861 when the American Confederacy lost the necessary quorum to conduct business; at which point the individual ‚ÄúFederal Republics‚Äù operated as another form of ‚Äústates‚Äù also failed.   (5) We still have the District States arising under the Northwest Ordinance and territories of the district of Columbia sometimes called ‚ÄúFederal enclaves‚Äù or Federal Management Units Judicial Districts Military Districts etc.   (6) We still have the United States Territories and Possessions sometimes called ‚Äúthe Insular States‚Äù.   All of six of these governmental entities three American and three Federal have given rise to ‚Äústates‚Äù and it behooves us to know this and to know that the general meaning of ‚Äústates‚Äù accepted by the Law of Nations is not used in Federal Codes and documents; since early on each document or Act of Congress defines the word ‚Äústate‚Äù as a legal term for the purposes of that document treaty or code.   You can now see why this is necessary.  Our Union States and our States of the Union have never stood under any Constitution.   The American Federation of States that the ‚ÄúFederal Government‚Äù is named after delegated the ‚Äúenumerated powers‚Äù to the Federal Subcontractors.   The Federation could never stand under any Constitution as a result of this role and neither could its member States.   The only form of American ‚ÄúState‚Äù to subject themselves and their Confederation to service under a Constitution were the original Confederate States of America (1781 to 1861) and these were all ‚ÄúStates of States‚Äù ‚Äì separate organizations in the business of providing governmental services under contract.   None of these above referenced &quot;states&quot; known as the Union States or as the States of the Union nor as the original Confederate States were of any Territorial origin. They were (in the case of the Confederacy) or are (in the case of the Union States and Federation States) of uniquely American origin.   The District (that is Territorial) States are a different story and arise on paper as a result of duties owed by the British Territorial Subcontractors under the Northwest Ordinance.  Likewise the so-called Insular States Puerto Rico Guam American Samoa et alia are known as territorial states and possessions of the United States.   All this tangled history all these various kinds of ‚Äústates‚Äù ‚Äì both those currently existing and those that are ‚Äúmissing‚Äù and awaiting reconstruction ‚Äì have to be separately known and acknowledged and defined their powers and relationships accounted for or it is literally impossible to know what you mean by ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù or ‚ÄúStates of America‚Äù or ‚ÄúUnited States of America‚Äù.   The later incorporation of the British Territorial version of ‚Äúthe United States of America‚Äù to create ‚Äúthe United States of America ‚Äì Incorporated‚Äù added another layer of complexity as we must additionally distinguish between incorporated and unincorporated ‚Äústates‚Äù.   Still later the Municipal Government of the United States also incorporated Municipal Corporations named after our States distinguished as STATES which are foreign Municipal Corporations.   These additional incorporated ‚Äústates‚Äù and ‚Äústates of states‚Äù just muddy the water more and cause more confusion and these are business entities only arising on paper; they are owned and operated by the Federal Subcontractors not the American people.   Bottom line: we have been feloniously impersonated and so have our Autochthonous States of the Union.   We have been ‚Äúassumed‚Äù to be responsible for the debts and outrages of these foreign corporations and their ‚Äústates‚Äù without our knowledge or consent.   We have been ‚Äúpresumed to acquiesce‚Äù to their activities apportioning themselves new rights new roles and new empowerments including but not limited to more than fifteen unilateral and unratified (by our States) Amendments to their service contracts and endless drafts against our credit and the unregulated enforcement of vast quantities of new Federal Code representing impositions that were never granted to them via any contract.   Let it be known that these Subcontractors never consulted nor fully informed their employers of their actions and presumptions and never bothered to actually implement the remedies published as a means to legalize their theft of American property.  This leads to the inevitable conclusion that these foreign Employees working as Federal Subcontractors used the plethora of confusions related to the kind and nature of ‚Äústates‚Äù and the absence of the American Confederacy after the Civil War to promote a mammoth and secretive fraud scheme against their actual Employers.   The absence of the American Confederacy in no way excuses their obligations owed to the American People and to the States of the Union and the Union States.   The absence of the American Confederacy doesn‚Äôt grant them any additional contracts or special powers. It doesn‚Äôt elevate or change the nature of their ‚Äústates‚Äù.

1,Joe Biden,['blacklivesmatter'  'ados'  'blackvotersmatters'  'donald trump'  'naacp'  'blackmediamatters'  'blackvotersmatter'  'news'  'youtube'],rauthschild,I dedicate this to all the members of the National Bar Association American Bar Association Attorney Generals Assistant Attorney Generals District Attorneys Prosecutors; and Federal State County and City Black Judges and Lawyers Collectively Illusional Criminals.  The following brief case commentary from the United States Supreme Court (the Federal Republic Court in 1805) comes from a Memorandum of Law written by the John Trowbridge in which he is at pains to explain the difference between confederate states (States of America) operating the Federal Republic under The Constitution for the united States of America and the District States created by General Washington as administrative units of the Territorial District of Columbia Government and all of these ‚Äústates‚Äù versus the Territories and Possessions of the United States known as the ‚ÄúInsular States‚Äù:   ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court explains the political distinction between on the one hand the members of the Union and on the other the District of Columbia and the territories:  &quot;On the part of the plaintiffs it has been urged that Columbia is a distinct political society and is therefore ‚Äúa state‚Äù according to the definitions of writers on general law.  This is true. But as the act of Congress obviously uses the word ‚Äústate‚Äù in reference to the term as used in the Constitution it becomes necessary to inquire whether Columbia is a state in the sense of that instrument.   The result of that examination is a conviction that the members of the American confederacy only are the states contemplated in the Constitution.  ‚Ä¶ These clauses show that the word ‚Äústate‚Äù is used in the Constitution as designating a member of the union of the original Confederation doing business as the States of America and excludes from the term the signification attached to it by writers on the law of nations.&quot;   Underline and boldface emphasis added. Hepburn &amp; Dundas v. Ellzey 6 U.S. 445 452 2 Cranch 445 2 L.Ed. 332 (1805).  &quot;It has been attempted to distinguish a Territory from the district sic of Columbia; but the court is of opinion that this distinction cannot be maintained.  They may differ in many respects but neither of them is a state in the sense in which that term is used in the constitution.‚Äù    Emphasis added. New Orleans v. Winter 1 Wheat. (U. S.) 91 4 L. Ed. 44 (1816).  These are definitive findings of the actual Federal Republic Supreme Court having the proper jurisdiction to decide these issues and what we herein discover is that:   The various kinds of ‚Äúterritories‚Äù either created administratively by the district of Columbia or arising as natural properties (Insular States) are not the ‚Äústates‚Äù referenced in the Constitution.   The ‚Äústates‚Äù in the Constitution being referenced in 1805 are the Confederate states that is ‚Äústates of state‚Äù that were members of the American Confederation formed in 1781 and known as ‚Äúthe American Confederacy‚Äù long before Jefferson Davis was born.   This all makes sense as the American States of States were the members of the States of America ‚Äì that is the Confederation ‚Äì awarded the Federal Constitution known as ‚ÄúThe Constitution for the united States of America‚Äù in 1787.   Secondly neither the district of Columbia nor the Territories attached to it are ‚Äústates‚Äù of this kind.   As we put it in our second International Public Notice addressed to Derek Johnson George Washington created District States not state districts; the government of the district called ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù is distinct and its ‚Äústates‚Äù are distinct both from the Confederate states and the United States Territories even though all three might meet the definition of ‚Äústate‚Äù contemplated more generally under international law.   These two Supreme Court cases tell us that within the purview of the Constitution forming the Federal Republic the only ‚Äústates‚Äù contemplated are the members of the original American Confederacy.   This distinction explains how we have (1) an American Federal Subcontractor dba States of America and its states which are members of the American Confederacy and (2) a district of Columbia Subcontractor and its territories (District States) which are not ‚Äústates‚Äù within the meaning of the Federal Constitution and (3) separate United States Territories and Possessions which are not ‚Äústates‚Äù in this context either.  Now you can better contemplate the complexity of the original Federal Government structure and discern how the use of the word ‚Äústate‚Äù was contextually used to mean some states and not others.   For Constitutional purposes the word ‚Äústate‚Äù refers to the Confederate states belonging to the ‚ÄúStates of America‚Äù the doing-business-as name of the original Confederation formed in 1781 which was awarded The Constitution for the united States of America in 1787. This is the Federal Government known as the Federal Republic.   In the original Federal Constitution (1787) the word ‚Äústate‚Äù does not refer to the District States set up by George Washington to administer the district of Columbia and its territories (1789 Constitution) nor does it refer to the United States Territories and Possessions as ‚Äústates‚Äù (1790 Constitution).  To summarize:  (1) We have the Union States that occupy the national soil jurisdiction of each nation-state.   (2) We have the Federation States that occupy the international land and sea jurisdiction belonging to each nation-state and the members of the Federation called States of the Union.   (3) We had the Confederate States (States-of-States) that were members of the original 1781 Confederation that occupied the global air jurisdiction belonging to each nation-state and which were known jointly as ‚Äúthe American Confederacy‚Äù.   (4) We had the above-mentioned Confederation doing business as the States of America and operating the Federal Republic under the 1787 Constitution for the united States of America until 1861 when the American Confederacy lost the necessary quorum to conduct business; at which point the individual ‚ÄúFederal Republics‚Äù operated as another form of ‚Äústates‚Äù also failed.   (5) We still have the District States arising under the Northwest Ordinance and territories of the district of Columbia sometimes called ‚ÄúFederal enclaves‚Äù or Federal Management Units Judicial Districts Military Districts etc.   (6) We still have the United States Territories and Possessions sometimes called ‚Äúthe Insular States‚Äù.   All of six of these governmental entities three American and three Federal have given rise to ‚Äústates‚Äù and it behooves us to know this and to know that the general meaning of ‚Äústates‚Äù accepted by the Law of Nations is not used in Federal Codes and documents; since early on each document or Act of Congress defines the word ‚Äústate‚Äù as a legal term for the purposes of that document treaty or code.   You can now see why this is necessary.  Our Union States and our States of the Union have never stood under any Constitution.   The American Federation of States that the ‚ÄúFederal Government‚Äù is named after delegated the ‚Äúenumerated powers‚Äù to the Federal Subcontractors.   The Federation could never stand under any Constitution as a result of this role and neither could its member States.   The only form of American ‚ÄúState‚Äù to subject themselves and their Confederation to service under a Constitution were the original Confederate States of America (1781 to 1861) and these were all ‚ÄúStates of States‚Äù ‚Äì separate organizations in the business of providing governmental services under contract.   None of these above referenced &quot;states&quot; known as the Union States or as the States of the Union nor as the original Confederate States were of any Territorial origin. They were (in the case of the Confederacy) or are (in the case of the Union States and Federation States) of uniquely American origin.   The District (that is Territorial) States are a different story and arise on paper as a result of duties owed by the British Territorial Subcontractors under the Northwest Ordinance.  Likewise the so-called Insular States Puerto Rico Guam American Samoa et alia are known as territorial states and possessions of the United States.   All this tangled history all these various kinds of ‚Äústates‚Äù ‚Äì both those currently existing and those that are ‚Äúmissing‚Äù and awaiting reconstruction ‚Äì have to be separately known and acknowledged and defined their powers and relationships accounted for or it is literally impossible to know what you mean by ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù or ‚ÄúStates of America‚Äù or ‚ÄúUnited States of America‚Äù.   The later incorporation of the British Territorial version of ‚Äúthe United States of America‚Äù to create ‚Äúthe United States of America ‚Äì Incorporated‚Äù added another layer of complexity as we must additionally distinguish between incorporated and unincorporated ‚Äústates‚Äù.   Still later the Municipal Government of the United States also incorporated Municipal Corporations named after our States distinguished as STATES which are foreign Municipal Corporations.   These additional incorporated ‚Äústates‚Äù and ‚Äústates of states‚Äù just muddy the water more and cause more confusion and these are business entities only arising on paper; they are owned and operated by the Federal Subcontractors not the American people.   Bottom line: we have been feloniously impersonated and so have our Autochthonous States of the Union.   We have been ‚Äúassumed‚Äù to be responsible for the debts and outrages of these foreign corporations and their ‚Äústates‚Äù without our knowledge or consent.   We have been ‚Äúpresumed to acquiesce‚Äù to their activities apportioning themselves new rights new roles and new empowerments including but not limited to more than fifteen unilateral and unratified (by our States) Amendments to their service contracts and endless drafts against our credit and the unregulated enforcement of vast quantities of new Federal Code representing impositions that were never granted to them via any contract.   Let it be known that these Subcontractors never consulted nor fully informed their employers of their actions and presumptions and never bothered to actually implement the remedies published as a means to legalize their theft of American property.  This leads to the inevitable conclusion that these foreign Employees working as Federal Subcontractors used the plethora of confusions related to the kind and nature of ‚Äústates‚Äù and the absence of the American Confederacy after the Civil War to promote a mammoth and secretive fraud scheme against their actual Employers.   The absence of the American Confederacy in no way excuses their obligations owed to the American People and to the States of the Union and the Union States.   The absence of the American Confederacy doesn‚Äôt grant them any additional contracts or special powers. It doesn‚Äôt elevate or change the nature of their ‚Äústates‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt ratify all the unratified ‚ÄúAmendments‚Äù they have unilaterally made to their own service contracts. It doesn‚Äôt allow them to declare war. It doesn‚Äôt allow them to impersonate Americans as ‚ÄúFederal Citizens‚Äù via undisclosed and unconscionable registrations and enrollments and enlistments. It doesn‚Äôt allow them to impersonate our Federation of States as a foreign incorporated entity.   The American Confederacy was never their Employer and its duties were never vouchsafed to them.   Their gross failure to fully inform the Federation of States that delegated their ‚Äúpowers‚Äù to them and their subsequent criminal activities resulting in gross harm to their employers speak for themselves.   These ‚ÄúFederal Corporations‚Äù have been operating as rogue ‚Äústates‚Äù ‚Äì and they are not ‚Äústates‚Äù of ours.   We have only by dint of our own hard work and investigation determined what these foreign entities have done ‚Äúin our names‚Äù and falsely alleged against our country and our people. No disclosure was provided to us or to our States of the Union by these criminal miscreants who are the responsibility of the Pope and His Imperial Majesty ‚ÄúKing‚Äù Charles and the Lord Mayor of London.   There is no contract or agreement allowing our Federal Subcontractors to promote a Mercenary Conflict on our shores and the continuation of this illegal and immoral nonsense for 164 years in view of the fact that both these organizations are ultimately owned and operated by the Pope ‚Äì directly in the case of the Municipal Corporations and indirectly through his Commonwealth Overseer in the case of the Territorial Corporations ‚Äî is purely criminal.   The Popes and the British Monarchs and the Governors and Mayors of Westminster have owed us good faith service throughout the duration of this self-interested crime spree and they have fraudulently pretended to be our protectors allies and custodians throughout this criminal rampage of predation and impersonation racketeering human trafficking and political usurpation.   The shame and the bill is entirely on them.,2024-07-09 22:18:05 GMT

The following brief case commentary from the United States Supreme Court (the Federal Republic Court in 1805) comes from a Memorandum of Law written by the John Trowbridge in which he is at pains to explain the difference between confederate states (States of America) operating the Federal Republic under The Constitution for the united States of America and the District States created by General Washington as administrative units of the Territorial District of Columbia Government and all of these ‚Äústates‚Äù versus the Territories and Possessions of the United States known as the ‚ÄúInsular States‚Äù:   ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court explains the political distinction between on the one hand the members of the Union and on the other the District of Columbia and the territories:  &quot;On the part of the plaintiffs it has been urged that Columbia is a distinct political society and is therefore ‚Äúa state‚Äù according to the definitions of writers on general law.  This is true. But as the act of Congress obviously uses the word ‚Äústate‚Äù in reference to the term as used in the Constitution it becomes necessary to inquire whether Columbia is a state in the sense of that instrument.   The result of that examination is a conviction that the members of the American confederacy only are the states contemplated in the Constitution.  ‚Ä¶ These clauses show that the word ‚Äústate‚Äù is used in the Constitution as designating a member of the union of the original Confederation doing business as the States of America and excludes from the term the signification attached to it by writers on the law of nations.&quot;   Underline and boldface emphasis added. Hepburn &amp; Dundas v. Ellzey 6 U.S. 445 452 2 Cranch 445 2 L.Ed. 332 (1805).  &quot;It has been attempted to distinguish a Territory from the district sic of Columbia; but the court is of opinion that this distinction cannot be maintained.  They may differ in many respects but neither of them is a state in the sense in which that term is used in the constitution.‚Äù    Emphasis added. New Orleans v. Winter 1 Wheat. (U. S.) 91 4 L. Ed. 44 (1816).  These are definitive findings of the actual Federal Republic Supreme Court having the proper jurisdiction to decide these issues and what we herein discover is that:   The various kinds of ‚Äúterritories‚Äù either created administratively by the district of Columbia or arising as natural properties (Insular States) are not the ‚Äústates‚Äù referenced in the Constitution.   The ‚Äústates‚Äù in the Constitution being referenced in 1805 are the Confederate states that is ‚Äústates of state‚Äù that were members of the American Confederation formed in 1781 and known as ‚Äúthe American Confederacy‚Äù long before Jefferson Davis was born.   This all makes sense as the American States of States were the members of the States of America ‚Äì that is the Confederation ‚Äì awarded the Federal Constitution known as ‚ÄúThe Constitution for the united States of America‚Äù in 1787.   Secondly neither the district of Columbia nor the Territories attached to it are ‚Äústates‚Äù of this kind.   As we put it in our second International Public Notice addressed to Derek Johnson George Washington created District States not state districts; the government of the district called ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù is distinct and its ‚Äústates‚Äù are distinct both from the Confederate states and the United States Territories even though all three might meet the definition of ‚Äústate‚Äù contemplated more generally under international law.   These two Supreme Court cases tell us that within the purview of the Constitution forming the Federal Republic the only ‚Äústates‚Äù contemplated are the members of the original American Confederacy.   This distinction explains how we have (1) an American Federal Subcontractor dba States of America and its states which are members of the American Confederacy and (2) a district of Columbia Subcontractor and its territories (District States) which are not ‚Äústates‚Äù within the meaning of the Federal Constitution and (3) separate United States Territories and Possessions which are not ‚Äústates‚Äù in this context either.  Now you can better contemplate the complexity of the original Federal Government structure and discern how the use of the word ‚Äústate‚Äù was contextually used to mean some states and not others.   For Constitutional purposes the word ‚Äústate‚Äù refers to the Confederate states belonging to the ‚ÄúStates of America‚Äù the doing-business-as name of the original Confederation formed in 1781 which was awarded The Constitution for the united States of America in 1787. This is the Federal Government known as the Federal Republic.   In the original Federal Constitution (1787) the word ‚Äústate‚Äù does not refer to the District States set up by George Washington to administer the district of Columbia and its territories (1789 Constitution) nor does it refer to the United States Territories and Possessions as ‚Äústates‚Äù (1790 Constitution).  To summarize:  (1) We have the Union States that occupy the national soil jurisdiction of each nation-state.   (2) We have the Federation States that occupy the international land and sea jurisdiction belonging to each nation-state and the members of the Federation called States of the Union.   (3) We had the Confederate States (States-of-States) that were members of the original 1781 Confederation that occupied the global air jurisdiction belonging to each nation-state and which were known jointly as ‚Äúthe American Confederacy‚Äù.   (4) We had the above-mentioned Confederation doing business as the States of America and operating the Federal Republic under the 1787 Constitution for the united States of America until 1861 when the American Confederacy lost the necessary quorum to conduct business; at which point the individual ‚ÄúFederal Republics‚Äù operated as another form of ‚Äústates‚Äù also failed.   (5) We still have the District States arising under the Northwest Ordinance and territories of the district of Columbia sometimes called ‚ÄúFederal enclaves‚Äù or Federal Management Units Judicial Districts Military Districts etc.   (6) We still have the United States Territories and Possessions sometimes called ‚Äúthe Insular States‚Äù.   All of six of these governmental entities three American and three Federal have given rise to ‚Äústates‚Äù and it behooves us to know this and to know that the general meaning of ‚Äústates‚Äù accepted by the Law of Nations is not used in Federal Codes and documents; since early on each document or Act of Congress defines the word ‚Äústate‚Äù as a legal term for the purposes of that document treaty or code.   You can now see why this is necessary.  Our Union States and our States of the Union have never stood under any Constitution.   The American Federation of States that the ‚ÄúFederal Government‚Äù is named after delegated the ‚Äúenumerated powers‚Äù to the Federal Subcontractors.   The Federation could never stand under any Constitution as a result of this role and neither could its member States.   The only form of American ‚ÄúState‚Äù to subject themselves and their Confederation to service under a Constitution were the original Confederate States of America (1781 to 1861) and these were all ‚ÄúStates of States‚Äù ‚Äì separate organizations in the business of providing governmental services under contract.   None of these above referenced &quot;states&quot; known as the Union States or as the States of the Union nor as the original Confederate States were of any Territorial origin. They were (in the case of the Confederacy) or are (in the case of the Union States and Federation States) of uniquely American origin.   The District (that is Territorial) States are a different story and arise on paper as a result of duties owed by the British Territorial Subcontractors under the Northwest Ordinance.  Likewise the so-called Insular States Puerto Rico Guam American Samoa et alia are known as territorial states and possessions of the United States.   All this tangled history all these various kinds of ‚Äústates‚Äù ‚Äì both those currently existing and those that are ‚Äúmissing‚Äù and awaiting reconstruction ‚Äì have to be separately known and acknowledged and defined their powers and relationships accounted for or it is literally impossible to know what you mean by ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù or ‚ÄúStates of America‚Äù or ‚ÄúUnited States of America‚Äù.   The later incorporation of the British Territorial version of ‚Äúthe United States of America‚Äù to create ‚Äúthe United States of America ‚Äì Incorporated‚Äù added another layer of complexity as we must additionally distinguish between incorporated and unincorporated ‚Äústates‚Äù.   Still later the Municipal Government of the United States also incorporated Municipal Corporations named after our States distinguished as STATES which are foreign Municipal Corporations.   These additional incorporated ‚Äústates‚Äù and ‚Äústates of states‚Äù just muddy the water more and cause more confusion and these are business entities only arising on paper; they are owned and operated by the Federal Subcontractors not the American people.   Bottom line: we have been feloniously impersonated and so have our Autochthonous States of the Union.   We have been ‚Äúassumed‚Äù to be responsible for the debts and outrages of these foreign corporations and their ‚Äústates‚Äù without our knowledge or consent.   We have been ‚Äúpresumed to acquiesce‚Äù to their activities apportioning themselves new rights new roles and new empowerments including but not limited to more than fifteen unilateral and unratified (by our States) Amendments to their service contracts and endless drafts against our credit and the unregulated enforcement of vast quantities of new Federal Code representing impositions that were never granted to them via any contract.   Let it be known that these Subcontractors never consulted nor fully informed their employers of their actions and presumptions and never bothered to actually implement the remedies published as a means to legalize their theft of American property.  This leads to the inevitable conclusion that these foreign Employees working as Federal Subcontractors used the plethora of confusions related to the kind and nature of ‚Äústates‚Äù and the absence of the American Confederacy after the Civil War to promote a mammoth and secretive fraud scheme against their actual Employers.   The absence of the American Confederacy in no way excuses their obligations owed to the American People and to the States of the Union and the Union States.   The absence of the American Confederacy doesn‚Äôt grant them any additional contracts or special powers. It doesn‚Äôt elevate or change the nature of their ‚Äústates‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt ratify all the unratified ‚ÄúAmendments‚Äù they have unilaterally made to their own service contracts. It doesn‚Äôt allow them to declare war. It doesn‚Äôt allow them to impersonate Americans as ‚ÄúFederal Citizens‚Äù via undisclosed and unconscionable registrations and enrollments and enlistments. It doesn‚Äôt allow them to impersonate our Federation of States as a foreign incorporated entity.   The American Confederacy was never their Employer and its duties were never vouchsafed to them.   Their gross failure to fully inform the Federation of States that delegated their ‚Äúpowers‚Äù to them and their subsequent criminal activities resulting in gross harm to their employers speak for themselves.   These ‚ÄúFederal Corporations‚Äù have been operating as rogue ‚Äústates‚Äù ‚Äì and they are not ‚Äústates‚Äù of ours.   We have only by dint of our own hard work and investigation determined what these foreign entities have done ‚Äúin our names‚Äù and falsely alleged against our country and our people. No disclosure was provided to us or to our States of the Union by these criminal miscreants who are the responsibility of the Pope and His Imperial Majesty ‚ÄúKing‚Äù Charles and the Lord Mayor of London.   There is no contract or agreement allowing our Federal Subcontractors to promote a Mercenary Conflict on our shores and the continuation of this illegal and immoral nonsense for 164 years in view of the fact that both these organizations are ultimately owned and operated by the Pope ‚Äì directly in the case of the Municipal Corporations and indirectly through his Commonwealth Overseer in the case of the Territorial Corporations ‚Äî is purely criminal.   The Popes and the British Monarchs and the Governors and Mayors of Westminster have owed us good faith service throughout the duration of this self-interested crime spree and they have fraudulently pretended to be our protectors allies and custodians throughout this criminal rampage of predation and impersonation racketeering human trafficking and political usurpation.   The shame and the bill is entirely on them.,2024-07-09 22:18:05 GMT

I don‚Äôt care if you think Biden is the worst candidate you‚Äôve ever laid your eyes on. Stop trying to suppress the will of the people. If you had something important to say about Biden the time to do so would have been BEFORE millions of Americans casted their votes in the primary.      üò°üò°     Man maybe Trump is just good for their careers. üòíüòíüòí being the opposition (especially against someone as disliked as Trump) can do wonders for one‚Äôs popularity.

4,Joe Biden,['us'  'politics'  'election'  '2024'  "ridin' with biden"  'biden/harris 2024'  'vote'  'vote blue'],originalleftist,One thing I‚Äôll say is that I very much doubt Joe Biden would remain in the race if HE didn‚Äôt truly believe as he says that he can get it done. Because why would he?  One thing I don‚Äôt think a lot of people fully appreciate is that the stakes are pretty damn high here for him too. First because his entire reputation and legacy are on the line. Even if he were driven solely by ego and ambition he has to know that a loss to Trump would destroy his legacy. If he had chosen to be a one-term President he‚Äôd probably be remembered by his supporters as a relatively harmless if perhaps not very significant President come what may. But if he loses now it will be forever presumed (rightly or wrongly) that his age and his refusal to drop out doomed America and the world.  Then there is the actual physical danger. Not only the hardship stress and exhaustion of the job itself but the fact that this is not a normal election and his opponent is not a normal candidate. If Biden loses his opponents have made it quite clear that they intend to abuse the Presidency (which thanks to SCOTUS now has near-unlimited power) to prosecute him. His son is already potentially facing prison time on charges that while not entirely without factual basis are also clearly politically-driven. Biden has rightly kept his oath of office and not interfered on his son‚Äôs behalf and made it clear that he will not pardon Hunter Biden. But he has to know that his son will be treated more harshly under a Trump DOJ.  When you‚Äôre 81 years old and you‚Äôre the most powerful man on Earth what do you have to work toward in the future? You‚Äôve climbed about as high as a person can and you probably don‚Äôt have that many years left. Beyond hoping for a few years of comfortable retirement (something Biden has put off to run again) there are really only two things to look forward to in a selfish sense: what sort of legacy you will leave behind and what will happen to your family when you‚Äôre gone. All of those are now on the line for Biden. So yes I absolutely do not believe he would be doing this if he didn‚Äôt think he could pull it off because he has as much skin in the game as anyone.,2024-07-09 22:28:28 GMT

D√°te at HuffPost:  WASHINGTON ‚Äï President Joe Biden on Tuesday praised the NATO alliance at its 75th anniversary celebration as he potentially became the last U.S. president to address the group‚Äôs annual summit.   Biden told the civilian and military leaders from 32 countries assembled in Washington that the alliance founded after World War II to keep the peace in Europe and thwart Soviet expansionism has a new mission in stopping Russian dictator Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.  ‚ÄúToday NATO is more powerful than ever ‚Äï 32 nations strong‚Äù he said at evening ceremonies at the Andrew Mellon Auditorium where the founding treaty was signed in 1949 as he welcomed the two newest members Sweden and Finland.   ‚ÄúOur commitment is broad and deep‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur nations will continue to keep faith in what we pledged in years to come.‚Äù   How long the United States will honor that pledge though is unclear. Donald Trump the coup-attempting former president who will become the Republican presidential nominee next week to challenge Biden‚Äôs reelection has long threatened to abandon NATO.   According to his own defense secretary Trump planned to pull out of the alliance in his second term ‚Äï a plan foiled by his loss to Biden in the 2020 election.  John Bolton his former national security adviser said Trump had wanted to withdraw in his first term and almost did at the summit in 2018. Bolton said Trump never understood how NATO worked and did not care to learn.   ‚ÄúHe spent four years as president he didn‚Äôt know anything about it when he entered the Oval Office and he didn‚Äôt know anything about it when he left‚Äù Bolton said in an interview earlier this year. ‚Ä¶   Although Biden told the audience that Americans appreciate the work of NATO it is nevertheless unclear what anyone could to do to stop Trump from unilaterally withdrawing from the treaty if he is elected and chooses to do so as presidents have sweeping power in international affairs. It is also unclear whether NATO could survive without the United States for the four years of a second Trump presidency ‚Äï or longer if he chooses not to leave office at the end of it.     Last night President Joe Biden (D) addressed the annual NATO Summit and he could possibly be the last sitting US President to address the organization.  Donald Trump if he gets elected into office again would like to pull the US out of NATO which would be a calamitous disaster and another way to pucker up to Russia.

Biden told the civilian and military leaders from 32 countries assembled in Washington that the alliance founded after World War II to keep the peace in Europe and thwart Soviet expansionism has a new mission in stopping Russian dictator Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.  ‚ÄúToday NATO is more powerful than ever ‚Äï 32 nations strong‚Äù he said at evening ceremonies at the Andrew Mellon Auditorium where the founding treaty was signed in 1949 as he welcomed the two newest members Sweden and Finland.   ‚ÄúOur commitment is broad and deep‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur nations will continue to keep faith in what we pledged in years to come.‚Äù   How long the United States will honor that pledge though is unclear. Donald Trump the coup-attempting former president who will become the Republican presidential nominee next week to challenge Biden‚Äôs reelection has long threatened to abandon NATO.   According to his own defense secretary Trump planned to pull out of the alliance in his second term ‚Äï a plan foiled by his loss to Biden in the 2020 election.  John Bolton his former national security adviser said Trump had wanted to withdraw in his first term and almost did at the summit in 2018. Bolton said Trump never understood how NATO worked and did not care to learn.   ‚ÄúHe spent four years as president he didn‚Äôt know anything about it when he entered the Oval Office and he didn‚Äôt know anything about it when he left‚Äù Bolton said in an interview earlier this year. ‚Ä¶   Although Biden told the audience that Americans appreciate the work of NATO it is nevertheless unclear what anyone could to do to stop Trump from unilaterally withdrawing from the treaty if he is elected and chooses to do so as presidents have sweeping power in international affairs. It is also unclear whether NATO could survive without the United States for the four years of a second Trump presidency ‚Äï or longer if he chooses not to leave office at the end of it.     Last night President Joe Biden (D) addressed the annual NATO Summit and he could possibly be the last sitting US President to address the organization.  Donald Trump if he gets elected into office again would like to pull the US out of NATO which would be a calamitous disaster and another way to pucker up to Russia.

D√°te at HuffPost:  WASHINGTON ‚Äï President Joe Biden on Tuesday praised the NATO alliance at its 75th anniversary celebration as he potentially became the last U.S. president to address the group‚Äôs annual summit.   Biden told the civilian and military leaders from 32 countries assembled in Washington that the alliance founded after World War II to keep the peace in Europe and thwart Soviet expansionism has a new mission in stopping Russian dictator Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.  ‚ÄúToday NATO is more powerful than ever ‚Äï 32 nations strong‚Äù he said at evening ceremonies at the Andrew Mellon Auditorium where the founding treaty was signed in 1949 as he welcomed the two newest members Sweden and Finland.   ‚ÄúOur commitment is broad and deep‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur nations will continue to keep faith in what we pledged in years to come.‚Äù   How long the United States will honor that pledge though is unclear. Donald Trump the coup-attempting former president who will become the Republican presidential nominee next week to challenge Biden‚Äôs reelection has long threatened to abandon NATO.   According to his own defense secretary Trump planned to pull out of the alliance in his second term ‚Äï a plan foiled by his loss to Biden in the 2020 election.  John Bolton his former national security adviser said Trump had wanted to withdraw in his first term and almost did at the summit in 2018. Bolton said Trump never understood how NATO worked and did not care to learn.   ‚ÄúHe spent four years as president he didn‚Äôt know anything about it when he entered the Oval Office and he didn‚Äôt know anything about it when he left‚Äù Bolton said in an interview earlier this year. ‚Ä¶   Although Biden told the audience that Americans appreciate the work of NATO it is nevertheless unclear what anyone could to do to stop Trump from unilaterally withdrawing from the treaty if he is elected and chooses to do so as presidents have sweeping power in international affairs. It is also unclear whether NATO could survive without the United States for the four years of a second Trump presidency ‚Äï or longer if he chooses not to leave office at the end of it.     Last night President Joe Biden (D) addressed the annual NATO Summit and he could possibly be the last sitting US President to address the organization.  Donald Trump if he gets elected into office again would like to pull the US out of NATO which would be a calamitous disaster and another way to pucker up to Russia.

I am not a Biden supporter by any means. I think the fact that he‚Äôs supporting and funding Israel is awful and that it should be called out on. But this is something that has been bothering me ever since the feedback Biden has received after the first debate for the 2024 election season.   I find it so hypocritical and ableist that people want Biden to step down because people think he could have some sort of mental condition that affects his cognitive skills like Dementia or Alzheimer‚Äôs. Meanwhile those same people who want Biden to step down are staying silent at the fact that Trump is somehow allowed to run for president after being thrown with over 30 charges and is planning on ‚Äúgoing full dictator‚Äù on day one which is a huge red flag.   The whole thing with trying to put a diagnosis on Biden‚Äôs hypothetical ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù is known as Armchair Diagnosing. Armchair Diagnosis or Armchair Psychology is when someone who doesn‚Äôt have any experience in the psychology field tries to put a diagnosis on someone or themselves. For example someone trying to call themselves OCD because they‚Äôre simply neat or someone calling someone else Autistic (especially if that person is neurotypical) for having certain quirks.   People who want Biden to step down while having no problem with Trump a now convicted felon running for president goes to show that both political parties have an ableism issues. Abled Leftists who came they support disabled people but want Biden to step down because they think he has a mental illness is ableist.

To finish this post I‚Äôm not telling anyone that they need to vote for Biden but I wanted to give my point of view of the whole thing of people wanting Biden to step down as someone whose disabled. If a young neurodivergent person was running for president Abled people (especially on both sides of the political aisle) would want that person to down for the same reasons they want Biden to step down. This includes if that said neurodivergent person is running against someone that‚Äôs similar to Trump.

I am not a Biden supporter by any means. I think the fact that he‚Äôs supporting and funding Israel is awful and that it should be called out on. But this is something that has been bothering me ever since the feedback Biden has received after the first debate for the 2024 election season.   I find it so hypocritical and ableist that people want Biden to step down because people think he could have some sort of mental condition that affects his cognitive skills like Dementia or Alzheimer‚Äôs. Meanwhile those same people who want Biden to step down are staying silent at the fact that Trump is somehow allowed to run for president after being thrown with over 30 charges and is planning on ‚Äúgoing full dictator‚Äù on day one which is a huge red flag.   The whole thing with trying to put a diagnosis on Biden‚Äôs hypothetical ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù is known as Armchair Diagnosing. Armchair Diagnosis or Armchair Psychology is when someone who doesn‚Äôt have any experience in the psychology field tries to put a diagnosis on someone or themselves. For example someone trying to call themselves OCD because they‚Äôre simply neat or someone calling someone else Autistic (especially if that person is neurotypical) for having certain quirks.   People who want Biden to step down while having no problem with Trump a now convicted felon running for president goes to show that both political parties have an ableism issues. Abled Leftists who came they support disabled people but want Biden to step down because they think he has a mental illness is ableist. People who think that Biden is not mentally fit to be president are saying that they‚Äôre okay with Trump being president because he‚Äôs more ‚Äúmentally fit‚Äù compared to Biden despite the fact he‚Äôs responsible for the January 6th riot has been hit with over 30 charges and has no problem with his cronies pushing laws that will decriminalize bigotry towards certain marginalized groups and push laws that will ban Drag performances access to gender affirming care to all Trans people of all ages and throwing any woman Trans man and AFAB Nonbinary person into prison for seeking abortion care.   To finish this post I‚Äôm not telling anyone that they need to vote for Biden but I wanted to give my point of view of the whole thing of people wanting Biden to step down as someone whose disabled. If a young neurodivergent person was running for president Abled people (especially on both sides of the political aisle) would want that person to down for the same reasons they want Biden to step down. This includes if that said neurodivergent person is running against someone that‚Äôs similar to Trump. On top of that it‚Äôs ableist to say that disabled people are not capable of having a job especially a job of high importance.

16,Joe Biden,['biden administration'  'israel'  'hamas'  'gaza'],eretzyisrael,Biden‚Äôs debate flop raises questions about his perplexing Gaza policy  by Lazar Berman  Ahead of the Rafah operation the Biden administration reduced and even withheld weapons shipments after pledging in October that ‚Äúwe are going to make sure you have what you need to protect your people to defend your nation.‚Äù  It also shocked Israel by withholding its veto on a March United Nations Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip without directly conditioning it on a hostage release.  A common explanation for the trend is Biden‚Äôs desire to retain left-wing support ahead of the November elections against the despised Donald Trump.  But after the debate in which Biden was at times incoherent and visibly sluggish throughout a more worrying question must be asked: Who has been running US policy on Israel since October?  From the outset many of Biden‚Äôs staffers have tried to pressure their boss to move away from his support for Israel.  Barely a month after the worst slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust ‚Äî and circulated weeks earlier ‚Äî over 400 administration staffers signed an open letter calling on the president to demand a ceasefire.  Around the same time some 1000 officials in the US Agency for International Development signed a separate open letter urging Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire.  In January 17 reelection campaign staffers signed a letter accusing Israel of genocide and ethnic cleansing.  Younger members of the administration know that Biden likes Israel but not Netanyahu and have tried to take advantage to move the dial away from Israel.  That pressure combined with the stances of more senior aides who simply want to win in November would be a lot for even the most energetic commander-in-chief to withstand.  But Biden clearly isn‚Äôt that person anymore.  Pletka is direct: ‚ÄúBiden doesn‚Äôt run his own government and the anti-Israel people are in charge.‚Äù  That the president flubbed even his rehearsed answers after a week of intense preparation doesn‚Äôt indicate he currently has the capacity to consistently impose his desires on a restive staff around a fraught issue like Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza.  And with Biden‚Äôs political future in serious doubt US policy could go in a number of directions:  If Biden does decide to drop out of the race and remain in office he could well revert to his core affinity for Israel to leave a legacy as one of the Jewish state‚Äôs great defenders ‚Äî staffers be damned.212  On the other hand if his aides handle him even more closely and limit his work schedule the elements in the White House which want to punish Netanyahu and shut down the war in Gaza as an end in itself will have a freer reign.  And if Biden drops out entirely stepping down as president in the coming days or weeks as more and more Democrats want it is entirely unclear who the presidential nominee would be and what direction they would take the party on Israel.  One thing is clear: For the coming months Biden will be perceived in the region as weak and his White House as far more concerned with domestic political challenges than Middle East conflicts.  Iran Hezbollah Hamas and company could see this as a half-year opportunity that won‚Äôt be available if the pugnacious and unpredictable Trump returns to Pennsylvania Avenue.,2024-07-10 18:02:09 GMT

16,Joe Biden,['biden administration'  'israel'  'hamas'  'gaza'],eretzyisrael,Biden‚Äôs debate flop raises questions about his perplexing Gaza policy  by Lazar Berman  Ahead of the Rafah operation the Biden administration reduced and even withheld weapons shipments after pledging in October that ‚Äúwe are going to make sure you have what you need to protect your people to defend your nation.‚Äù  It also shocked Israel by withholding its veto on a March United Nations Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip without directly conditioning it on a hostage release.  A common explanation for the trend is Biden‚Äôs desire to retain left-wing support ahead of the November elections against the despised Donald Trump.  But after the debate in which Biden was at times incoherent and visibly sluggish throughout a more worrying question must be asked: Who has been running US policy on Israel since October?  From the outset many of Biden‚Äôs staffers have tried to pressure their boss to move away from his support for Israel.  Barely a month after the worst slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust ‚Äî and circulated weeks earlier ‚Äî over 400 administration staffers signed an open letter calling on the president to demand a ceasefire.  Around the same time some 1000 officials in the US Agency for International Development signed a separate open letter urging Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire.  In January 17 reelection campaign staffers signed a letter accusing Israel of genocide and ethnic cleansing.  Younger members of the administration know that Biden likes Israel but not Netanyahu and have tried to take advantage to move the dial away from Israel.  That pressure combined with the stances of more senior aides who simply want to win in November would be a lot for even the most energetic commander-in-chief to withstand.  But Biden clearly isn‚Äôt that person anymore.  Pletka is direct: ‚ÄúBiden doesn‚Äôt run his own government and the anti-Israel people are in charge.‚Äù  That the president flubbed even his rehearsed answers after a week of intense preparation doesn‚Äôt indicate he currently has the capacity to consistently impose his desires on a restive staff around a fraught issue like Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza.  And with Biden‚Äôs political future in serious doubt US policy could go in a number of directions:  If Biden does decide to drop out of the race and remain in office he could well revert to his core affinity for Israel to leave a legacy as one of the Jewish state‚Äôs great defenders ‚Äî staffers be damned.212  On the other hand if his aides handle him even more closely and limit his work schedule the elements in the White House which want to punish Netanyahu and shut down the war in Gaza as an end in itself will have a freer reign.  And if Biden drops out entirely stepping down as president in the coming days or weeks as more and more Democrats want it is entirely unclear who the presidential nominee would be and what direction they would take the party on Israel.  One thing is clear: For the coming months Biden will be perceived in the region as weak and his White House as far more concerned with domestic political challenges than Middle East conflicts.  Iran Hezbollah Hamas and company could see this as a half-year opportunity that won‚Äôt be available if the pugnacious and unpredictable Trump returns to Pennsylvania Avenue.,2024-07-10 18:02:09 GMT

The former president and presumptive Republican nominee was speaking to a crowd of several hundred supporters at his golf club in Doral a western suburb of Miami keeping them waiting in 90F heat for a freewheeling monologue that began more than an hour later than scheduled.  There was speculation that he might use his first public appearance since last month‚Äôs debate with the president to announce Florida senator Marco Rubio who was present as his vice-presidential pick six days ahead of the Republican national convention (RNC) in Milwaukee.   Instead Trump delivered a rambling 75-minute speech that included a succession of attacks on Biden and his faltering debate performance which has raised questions among Democrats on whether the 81-year-old president was robust enough for a second term of office.  He seized on the post-debate turbulence that has prompted calls from some senior Democrats for Biden to step down and nominate Kamala Harris.   ‚ÄúThe radical left Democratic party is divided in chaos and having a full scale breakdown all because they can‚Äôt decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president sleepy crooked Joe Biden or laughing Kamala‚Äù he said repeating previous derogatory terms for the pair.  ‚ÄúDespite all the Democrat panic this week the truth is it doesn‚Äôt matter who they nominate because we are going to beat any one of them in a thundering landslide.‚Äù   Trump has kept a lower than usual profile in the days since the debate a strategy an aide described as designed to allow Democrats to tear into each other following Biden‚Äôs dismal debate performance.  His remarks on Tuesday were notable for adding the vice-president‚Äôs name to numerous attacks on Biden policies and sprinkling in mentions of both Rubio and Byron Donalds a Republican Florida congressman also believed to be on Trump‚Äôs shortlist for vice-president.   Otherwise it was a standard Trump stump speech full of evidence-free claims that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent; baseless accusations that overseas nations were sending to the US ‚Äúmost of their prisoners‚Äù; and a laughable assertion that a gathering of supporters numbering in the hundreds was really a crowd of 45000.   It also touched on the surreal. Biden he insisted had raised the price of bacon four-fold. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt eat bacon any more‚Äù Trump said.  Electric cars he said ‚Äúcheated‚Äù the US public because drivers had to stop for three hours to recharge their vehicles after every 45 minutes of driving. And in an echo of one of the more bizarre debate exchanges with Biden over who was the better golfer he challenged his White House successor to 18 holes over the Doral course while granting a 10-stroke concession.   ‚ÄúIt will be among the most watched sporting events in history maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters‚Äù Trump said pledging $1m to a charity of Biden‚Äôs choosing if he lost.   Returning to politics Trump assailed Democrats for tax rises he said they wanted to impose; criticized Biden for the US military‚Äôs chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan; and promised to build an ‚Äúiron dome‚Äù missile defense system for the US if he was elected in November.  Donald Trump‚Äôs first post-debate rally on Tuesday in Doral Florida served up the greatest hits of lies to his gullible brainwashed rallygoers.

The former president and presumptive Republican nominee was speaking to a crowd of several hundred supporters at his golf club in Doral a western suburb of Miami keeping them waiting in 90F heat for a freewheeling monologue that began more than an hour later than scheduled.  There was speculation that he might use his first public appearance since last month‚Äôs debate with the president to announce Florida senator Marco Rubio who was present as his vice-presidential pick six days ahead of the Republican national convention (RNC) in Milwaukee.   Instead Trump delivered a rambling 75-minute speech that included a succession of attacks on Biden and his faltering debate performance which has raised questions among Democrats on whether the 81-year-old president was robust enough for a second term of office.  He seized on the post-debate turbulence that has prompted calls from some senior Democrats for Biden to step down and nominate Kamala Harris.   ‚ÄúThe radical left Democratic party is divided in chaos and having a full scale breakdown all because they can‚Äôt decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president sleepy crooked Joe Biden or laughing Kamala‚Äù he said repeating previous derogatory terms for the pair.  ‚ÄúDespite all the Democrat panic this week the truth is it doesn‚Äôt matter who they nominate because we are going to beat any one of them in a thundering landslide.‚Äù   Trump has kept a lower than usual profile in the days since the debate a strategy an aide described as designed to allow Democrats to tear into each other following Biden‚Äôs dismal debate performance.

Otherwise it was a standard Trump stump speech full of evidence-free claims that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent; baseless accusations that overseas nations were sending to the US ‚Äúmost of their prisoners‚Äù; and a laughable assertion that a gathering of supporters numbering in the hundreds was really a crowd of 45000.

1,Joe Biden,['media coverage'  'presidential politics'],worldofwardcraft,They‚Äôre at it again. July 11 2024  According to William Safire it was Gerald L. Warren editor of the San Diego Union who first applied the expression to reporters. In a 1977 speech Warren compared the excessively aggressive tactics of some journalists to ‚Äúsharks in a feeding frenzy.‚Äù And in his 1991 book Feeding Frenzy: How Attack Journalism Has Transformed American Politics Larry Sabato criticized what he described as the media‚Äôs focus on unflattering stories about political candidates and the reduced coverage of serious issues that often results.  Now following President Joe Biden‚Äôs poor performance in the June 27 presidential debate the nation‚Äôs leading newspapers (with the welcome exception of Philadelphia‚Äôs The Inquirer) joined by the broadcast and cable news networks have set their sights on Biden in a concerted effort to drive him out of the presidential race.  Here‚Äôs a sampling of headlines from the daily barrage of articles in the ‚Äúliberal‚Äù New York Times beginning with the one by its Editorial Board on June 28 the day after the debate:  ‚Ä¢ To serve his country President Biden should leave the race. ‚Ä¢ Should Biden heed calls to drop out? June 30 ‚Ä¢ Will Biden withdraw? July 1 ‚Ä¢ Biden tells allies he knows he has only days to salvage his candidacy. July 3 ‚Ä¢ Biden in crisis. July 4 ‚Ä¢ The pressure on Biden to drop out. July 5 ‚Ä¢ Should Biden end his 2024 campaign? July 8 ‚Ä¢ Can Democrats replace Biden? July 9  Naturally other members of the journalistic swarm are also contributing to the hysteria. ‚ÄúMounting demands on Biden to step aside from the 2024 race‚Äù has been the lead story on NBC‚Äôs Nightly News with Lester Holt for the past two weeks with about a quarter of the show devoted exclusively to it. Meanwhile sister network MSNBC helpfully posted online a list of Democratic electeds who have been pressured by the media onslaught to call for Biden‚Äôs withdrawal from the ticket.  But as Bill Palmer of the Palmer Report has remarked such media freak-outs ‚Äúreally are nothing more than scripted ratings-driven performance art.‚Äù And University of New Hampshire communications prof Seth Abramson observes:  It‚Äôs the lobbyists donors politicos journalists and D.C. lawmakers ‚Äî uniquely self-interested political operators ‚Äî who want President Biden to end his political career but not the voters who will actually decide this election.  We saw this same media mania eight years ago when news outlets ran countless stories about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs health and of course her emails. Now we‚Äôre seeing it once more. Only this time Joe Biden is the prey.,2024-07-11 14:27:56 GMT

Ask him to spell it for amusement during these inflationary times. Crime‚Äôs up unlike the value of money which seems backward. Blame his younger mentor for guiding him on implementing awful lunacy that causes enough damage to make the conspiratorial wonder if it‚Äôs intentional.  Part-time president Barack Obama remains a full-time aggravation. He isn‚Äôt just physically guiding his marionette. The very fair media would like you to believe the incumbent is capable of standing on his own just like he is proficient at reasoning. But his last supervisor helps him with both.  Obama‚Äôs fourth term would be an ode to FDR. A soft reboot is a hard prospect. Running your life as a complimentary courtesy offered by the most compassionate of parties. Democrats claiming they have new ideas hope you‚Äôre not into history any more than you are researching what happens when the Treasury prints too much cash.  Sticking with Biden even as the tumbleweeds take over in his skill is part of Obama‚Äôs sincere commitment to maintaining power. That‚Äôs just the start of selflessness for a former/quasi-current president who tirelessly wants to keep making your life difficult.  Feeling hassled is surely in your best interest. Why would one particular style of politician confiscate your autonomy otherwise? The thought being bossed around for 16 dreadful years by the worst possible bosses should make anyone quit. The best case against government is made by its lustiest endorsers. There‚Äôs a reason those who can only profit off holding office want to remove your right to dissent.  It‚Äôs so progressive to allow a man of color to really be in charge. The scheme could use a more convincing frontman. Biden was a nastily confused dolt before the Bicentennial. He thought America needed fixing then too. Obama is as bad at choosing puppets as he is at policies.  When rules aren‚Äôt to your liking circumvent them. It‚Äôs almost clever. There have been far too many terms dedicated to incinerating the shredded Constitution. This White House is only efficient at installing a most inefficient regime.  The Obama Party violates America‚Äôs rulebook but at least they ruin the country. Lamenting harm is not just a conceptual matter although their ideas could‚Äôve been implemented by a flying saucer piloted by aliens who aren‚Äôt equipped with morality. Every liberal scheme is based in thinking they can spend better than those who earned it. The first example of it actually happening will be so refreshing.  The last Democrat only seems relaxed. Each infuriatingly inane post balancing lame false equivalence with calls for hideous overreach that were discredited by experience throughout last century spurs a twitchy flashback. The Berlin Wall fell in order for fans of the state to yearn for the East.  Everything headed downhill when people chose Facebook over MySpace. That could be coincidental unlike how trying times followed investing faith in the most obvious phony humankind has ever produced.  Professional dupes who remain unwilling to admit to getting suckered insist on still pretending that everything would be swell if we only allowed the mellifluous speaker to unite us. Trusting conmen is now the semipermanent political trend. Thinking that style makes the difference is typical amongst vying cults. Members of the one into angry catharsis loathe those who prefer brain-dead cynicism risibly presented as hope.  The downside of Obama‚Äôs legacy is doing awful things as a byproduct of being a dreadful moron. Seducing dupes into signing over everything is shameless but won‚Äôt end until victims tire of getting ripped off. Unlike timeshare salesmen you can‚Äôt leave once you got your golf clubs.  Try meth for a healthier alternative to getting hooked on entitlements. Spending untold trillions for worse outcomes is working superbly otherwise. Fretting there‚Äôs not enough funding is a common excuse for inevitable failure just like never asking who provides it.  There might be fewer addicts if the dealer didn‚Äôt get his way. Getting high on their own product is the worst mistake. Democrats in office possess precisely zero chance of them ever turning to productive careers. Who‚Äôd hire them? Influence is the most useless product to sell yet remains in vogue thanks to the very market crashers who peddle it.  A previous president hovering over the present one only sounds like a lunatic conspiracy. It‚Äôs like arming Mexican drug lords in order to pimp a gun control agenda or letting terrorists murder an ambassador because sending help for him would‚Äôve served as an admission that their policy failed.  Biden was is and always will be Obama‚Äôs bitch. As for a fictional drug dealer who pretended to be a good community citizen Gus Fring was way more interesting.  Exploiting misery is their brand. Democrats need as much inventory as possible. Dedicated parasites not about to manufacture anything people want so they‚Äôll focus on a financial meltdown caused by federal meddling that they of course blame on corporate greed. CEOs discovered inflation just after Biden got his way. Businesses are obviously deliberately making people poor so nobody can‚Äôt buy anything just like Biden‚Äôs lackeys claim.  Like sucks like Obama‚Äôs still president because he sort-of is. Cheap dates aren‚Äôt getting seduced as easily. Biden is uncharismatic version of the same toxic ideology that he believed as Obama‚Äôs Igor. Now he‚Äôs as animated as the monster. That‚Äôs enough of the remakes.,2024-07-11 12:01:03 GMT
12,Joe Biden,['trump rallies'  'kamala harris'  'bacon'  'electric vehicles'  '2024 presidential election'  'donald trump'],justinspoliticalcorner,Trump airs list of false grievances at Florida rally: ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt eat bacon any more‚Äô  Richard Luscombe at The Guardian:  Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail in Florida on Tuesday night hurling insults at Joe Biden and airing a litany of familiar grievances but declining to name a running mate for November‚Äôs general election.   The former president and presumptive Republican nominee was speaking to a crowd of several hundred supporters at his golf club in Doral a western suburb of Miami keeping them waiting in 90F heat for a freewheeling monologue that began more than an hour later than scheduled.  There was speculation that he might use his first public appearance since last month‚Äôs debate with the president to announce Florida senator Marco Rubio who was present as his vice-presidential pick six days ahead of the Republican national convention (RNC) in Milwaukee.   Instead Trump delivered a rambling 75-minute speech that included a succession of attacks on Biden and his faltering debate performance which has raised questions among Democrats on whether the 81-year-old president was robust enough for a second term of office.  He seized on the post-debate turbulence that has prompted calls from some senior Democrats for Biden to step down and nominate Kamala Harris.   ‚ÄúThe radical left Democratic party is divided in chaos and having a full scale breakdown all because they can‚Äôt decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president sleepy crooked Joe Biden or laughing Kamala‚Äù he said repeating previous derogatory terms for the pair.  ‚ÄúDespite all the Democrat panic this week the truth is it doesn‚Äôt matter who they nominate because we are going to beat any one of them in a thundering landslide.‚Äù   Trump has kept a lower than usual profile in the days since the debate a strategy an aide described as designed to allow Democrats to tear into each other following Biden‚Äôs dismal debate performance.  His remarks on Tuesday were notable for adding the vice-president‚Äôs name to numerous attacks on Biden policies and sprinkling in mentions of both Rubio and Byron Donalds a Republican Florida congressman also believed to be on Trump‚Äôs shortlist for vice-president.   Otherwise it was a standard Trump stump speech full of evidence-free claims that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent; baseless accusations that overseas nations were sending to the US ‚Äúmost of their prisoners‚Äù; and a laughable assertion that a gathering of supporters numbering in the hundreds was really a crowd of 45000.   It also touched on the surreal. Biden he insisted had raised the price of bacon four-fold. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt eat bacon any more‚Äù Trump said.  Electric cars he said ‚Äúcheated‚Äù the US public because drivers had to stop for three hours to recharge their vehicles after every 45 minutes of driving. And in an echo of one of the more bizarre debate exchanges with Biden over who was the better golfer he challenged his White House successor to 18 holes over the Doral course while granting a 10-stroke concession.   ‚ÄúIt will be among the most watched sporting events in history maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters‚Äù Trump said pledging $1m to a charity of Biden‚Äôs choosing if he lost.   Returning to politics Trump assailed Democrats for tax rises he said they wanted to impose; criticized Biden for the US military‚Äôs chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan; and promised to build an ‚Äúiron dome‚Äù missile defense system for the US if he was elected in November.  Donald Trump‚Äôs first post-debate rally on Tuesday in Doral Florida served up the greatest hits of lies to his gullible brainwashed rallygoers.

Biden was is and always will be Obama‚Äôs bitch. As for a fictional drug dealer who pretended to be a good community citizen Gus Fring was way more interesting.  Exploiting misery is their brand. Democrats need as much inventory as possible. Dedicated parasites not about to manufacture anything people want so they‚Äôll focus on a financial meltdown caused by federal meddling that they of course blame on corporate greed. CEOs discovered inflation just after Biden got his way. Businesses are obviously deliberately making people poor so nobody can‚Äôt buy anything just like Biden‚Äôs lackeys claim.  Like sucks like Obama‚Äôs still president because he sort-of is. Cheap dates aren‚Äôt getting seduced as easily. Biden is uncharismatic version of the same toxic ideology that he believed as Obama‚Äôs Igor. Now he‚Äôs as animated as the monster. That‚Äôs enough of the remakes.,2024-07-11 12:01:03 GMT

The former president and presumptive Republican nominee was speaking to a crowd of several hundred supporters at his golf club in Doral a western suburb of Miami keeping them waiting in 90F heat for a freewheeling monologue that began more than an hour later than scheduled.  There was speculation that he might use his first public appearance since last month‚Äôs debate with the president to announce Florida senator Marco Rubio who was present as his vice-presidential pick six days ahead of the Republican national convention (RNC) in Milwaukee.   Instead Trump delivered a rambling 75-minute speech that included a succession of attacks on Biden and his faltering debate performance which has raised questions among Democrats on whether the 81-year-old president was robust enough for a second term of office.  He seized on the post-debate turbulence that has prompted calls from some senior Democrats for Biden to step down and nominate Kamala Harris.   ‚ÄúThe radical left Democratic party is divided in chaos and having a full scale breakdown all because they can‚Äôt decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president sleepy crooked Joe Biden or laughing Kamala‚Äù he said repeating previous derogatory terms for the pair.  ‚ÄúDespite all the Democrat panic this week the truth is it doesn‚Äôt matter who they nominate because we are going to beat any one of them in a thundering landslide.‚Äù   Trump has kept a lower than usual profile in the days since the debate a strategy an aide described as designed to allow Democrats to tear into each other following Biden‚Äôs dismal debate performance.  His remarks on Tuesday were notable for adding the vice-president‚Äôs name to numerous attacks on Biden policies and sprinkling in mentions of both Rubio and Byron Donalds a Republican Florida congressman also believed to be on Trump‚Äôs shortlist for vice-president.   Otherwise it was a standard Trump stump speech full of evidence-free claims that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent; baseless accusations that overseas nations were sending to the US ‚Äúmost of their prisoners‚Äù; and a laughable assertion that a gathering of supporters numbering in the hundreds was really a crowd of 45000.   It also touched on the surreal. Biden he insisted had raised the price of bacon four-fold. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt eat bacon any more‚Äù Trump said.  Electric cars he said ‚Äúcheated‚Äù the US public because drivers had to stop for three hours to recharge their vehicles after every 45 minutes of driving. And in an echo of one of the more bizarre debate exchanges with Biden over who was the better golfer he challenged his White House successor to 18 holes over the Doral course while granting a 10-stroke concession.   ‚ÄúIt will be among the most watched sporting events in history maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters‚Äù Trump said pledging $1m to a charity of Biden‚Äôs choosing if he lost.   Returning to politics Trump assailed Democrats for tax rises he said they wanted to impose; criticized Biden for the US military‚Äôs chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan; and promised to build an ‚Äúiron dome‚Äù missile defense system for the US if he was elected in November.  Donald Trump‚Äôs first post-debate rally on Tuesday in Doral Florida served up the greatest hits of lies to his gullible brainwashed rallygoers.

For the past two weeks Biden and his administration have rejected questions about his health and calls for him to pass on the torch to a younger Democratic candidate with Biden arguing last Friday that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone is more qualified to be president and win this race than me.‚Äù  But Welch a 77-year-old who has represented Vermont in Congress for nearly two decades said that he does not believe that is true ‚Äì and that the voters he represents do not believe it either.   Even though ‚ÄúVermont loves Joe Biden‚Äù he wrote ‚Äúregular Vermonters are worried that he can‚Äôt win this time and they‚Äôre terrified of another Trump presidency. These are real concerns of regular voters who I‚Äôve heard from recently ‚Äì like a mom who counts on the child tax credit and seniors who rely on Medicare.‚Äù   Instead Welch argued the Democratic party should turn to another one of the ‚Äúdeep bench‚Äù of Democrats ‚Äúthat can defeat Trump‚Äù.

Whatever he decides we go with‚Äù Pelosi said on MSNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMorning Joe‚Äù program.   Biden has said he thinks the debate over his mental fitness to run that was sparked by his poor debate performance against Donald Trump has run its course and the party should line up in support of him.   But at least some Democrats on Capitol Hill remain unconvinced. Another House member Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) called Tuesday for Biden to step back from the race.   While Democrats like Sherrill see the danger of Biden losing and simultaneously taking down the chances for Democrats to control either chamber of Congress others believe Biden still has the best chance to beat Trump again and that public debate over that is unproductive. House and Senate Democrats met separately Tuesday to discuss the impasse but in both cases the meetings were inconclusive.  ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short‚Äù she said seemingly overlooking Biden‚Äôs comments earlier in the week saying he was staying in the race.  Appearing on MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe yesterday Speaker Emerita and Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D) stated that the decision for Joe Biden to run again is up to him.

While it has garnered a significant base of support it has also raised concerns about its potential dangers. This blog post explores the various aspects of the MAGA movement analyzing its possible risks and the implications for the future of American society.  Historical Context  The MAGA movement originated during Donald Trump‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign with the slogan ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù appealing to many Americans who felt left behind by globalization and economic changes. The movement‚Äôs core message was to restore America‚Äôs former glory by focusing on national interests reducing immigration and renegotiating trade deals.  Potential Dangers  1. Polarization and Division  One of the most significant dangers of the MAGA movement is its contribution to political polarization and division. The rhetoric often used by its leaders and supporters can be divisive pitting different groups against each other based on factors such as race religion or political affiliation. This polarization can lead to a fractured society where constructive dialogue becomes difficult and consensus on critical issues is nearly impossible to achieve.  The Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement spearheaded by former President Donald Trump has sparked significant controversy and raised concerns about its potential impact on the fabric of American society. While the movement‚Äôs rhetoric appeals to a sense of patriotism and a desire for national prosperity it has also been criticized for promoting divisive and extreme views.  One of the primary dangers associated with the MAGA movement is the perpetuation of divisive rhetoric and the potential for fueling social tensions. The movement‚Äôs narrative often portrays a stark divide between ‚Äútrue Americans‚Äù and those perceived as outsiders or threats leading to a polarized and fragmented society. This divisiveness can undermine the principles of unity inclusivity and respect for diversity that are fundamental to a healthy democracy.  Additionally the MAGA movement has been linked to the rise of extreme ideologies and fringe groups with radical agendas. While the movement itself may not explicitly endorse violence its rhetoric and messaging have been co-opted by individuals and organizations that promote hate intolerance and in some cases violent extremism. This association raises concerns about the potential normalization of extremist views and the potential for escalating tensions and conflicts.  Furthermore the MAGA movement‚Äôs skepticism towards mainstream media and its embrace of alternative sources of information have contributed to the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories. This erosion of trust in authoritative sources and the blurring of fact and fiction can undermine the ability of citizens to make informed decisions and foster an environment where disinformation thrives.  It is crucial to acknowledge that the MAGA movement represents a diverse range of perspectives and individuals and not all supporters espouse extreme or divisive views. However the concerns raised about its rhetoric associations and potential consequences for social cohesion and democratic norms should be carefully examined and addressed through open and constructive dialogue.  2. Undermining Democratic Principles: A Narrative of Decay One of the primary concerns surrounding the MAGA movement is its alleged erosion of democratic norms and institutions. Critics have pointed to the movement‚Äôs repeated allegations of widespread voter fraud and its refusal to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election as undermining trust in the electoral process. Additionally the movement‚Äôs attacks on the free press and labeling of unfavorable coverage as ‚Äúfake news‚Äù have been seen as attempts to discredit a vital component of a healthy democracy.  The MAGA movement has also been criticized for its divisive rhetoric and embrace of extreme views. The movement‚Äôs nationalist and populist messaging has been accused of fostering an ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù mentality pitting different groups against one another based on race religion or political affiliation. Additionally some fringe elements within the movement have been linked to white supremacist ideologies and conspiracy theories raising concerns about the normalization of extremist views.  Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the MAGA movement is its potential for inciting violence. The movement has been blamed for emboldening individuals and groups with a propensity for violence as evidenced by the events surrounding the January 6th insurrection at the United States Capitol. The inflammatory rhetoric and unwillingness to accept electoral outcomes have been cited as contributing factors to the violence witnessed on that day.  As the MAGA movement continues to evolve and shape political discourse it is crucial to maintain a critical and objective perspective. While the movement may resonate with some segments of the population its potential impact on democratic institutions its divisive rhetoric and its association with extremist elements and violence should be carefully examined and addressed.  3. Divisive Rhetoric and Extreme Views  The MAGA movement has been criticized for its divisive rhetoric which often targets minority groups immigrants and political opponents. Extreme views and conspiracy theories have found a foothold within certain factions of the movement fueling an ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù mentality. This polarization can erode social trust undermine democratic institutions and potentially lead to violence.  The MAGA movement has sometimes been associated with extremist groups and individuals. Events such as the Capitol riot on January 6 2021 highlight the potential for violent actions stemming from extreme ideological beliefs. The normalization of extremist rhetoric can lead to an increase in hate crimes and domestic terrorism posing a threat to public safety and national security.  The movement‚Äôs stance on immigration and its often-nationalist rhetoric can have adverse effects on minority groups. Policies perceived as anti-immigrant or exclusionary can foster an environment of fear and discrimination. This can lead to social unrest and a further divide between different communities within the country undermining the principles of equality and unity.  While the MAGA movement promises economic prosperity its protectionist and isolationist tendencies could have unintended consequences. Strained relationships with international allies trade disputes and a focus on domestic industries may hinder global competitiveness and economic growth in the long run.  It is crucial to examine the MAGA movement through an objective and fact-based lens recognizing both its potential benefits and risks. A balanced and inclusive approach grounded in democratic values and respect for diversity is essential to address the concerns raised and foster unity within the nation.  4. Strained International Relations The MAGA movement centered on ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù prioritizes domestic interests over global cooperation which can strain international relations. Policies such as renegotiating trade deals and withdrawing from international agreements reflect an isolationist stance that may provoke tensions with other nations. This approach risks diminishing America‚Äôs influence globally by reducing its role in collaborative efforts and undermining established alliances. The emphasis on unilateral actions could hinder international cooperation on crucial issues like climate change security and economic stability. Furthermore it may isolate the United States diplomatically weakening its ability to shape global policies and responses effectively. In essence while ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù policies aim to prioritize national interests they potentially sacrifice broader international partnerships and leadership roles impacting both global stability and America‚Äôs standing on the world stage.  Conclusion While the MAGA movement has undoubtedly resonated with a significant portion of the American population it is essential to consider its potential dangers. The risks of increased polarization erosion of democratic norms rise of extremism negative impact on minority groups and strained international relations are serious concerns that need to be addressed. Moving forward all political movements must strive for unity uphold democratic principles and promote inclusivity to ensure a stable and prosperous future for all Americans.  By understanding and acknowledging these potential dangers we can work towards mitigating them and fostering a more cohesive and resilient society.,2024-07-11 21:58:29 GMT
19,Joe Biden,['politics'  'kamala harris'  'donald trump'  'probably not going to engage with people who misread or argue with this in bad faith'  'but feel free to reblog'],lesserjoke,Personally I think Joe Biden has done a much better job as president than most people give him credit for* (and certainly better than Donald Trump did / would have done if reelected last time). I also think that a presidential administration is far more than one person and when I vote for a candidate I‚Äôm thinking of the policy platform their team at large will work towards implementing not to mention issues like the Supreme Court and lower-bench nominations. I know I‚Äôll be voting in November for the Democratic nominee over Trump or any other Republican because I firmly believe that that choice will lead to better outcomes across the board.  At the same time I think the concerns people have about Biden‚Äôs health these days are totally justified that his VP Kamala Harris could seamlessly take over as candidate and do a better job defending / advocating for their administration‚Äôs record and future plans and that every day the campaign spends arguing with critics about that is one fewer day they can devote to pounding the case against Donald Trump in the popular imagination. Undecided swing voters and people who might sit out the election entirely need to be inspired by the Democratic platform not just convinced to fall in line and ignore the reasonable questions about Biden‚Äôs continued viability.  In short: the 2020 presidential election was largely a referendum on Trump which Joe Biden won handily. 2024 is shaping up to be a referendum on Biden ‚Äì and particularly on his future potential not his past record ‚Äì that he is not nearly as well-suited to win. A campaign shakeup of a different nominee would let the Democrats argue both the strengths of what he‚Äôs achieved and the dangers of letting Trump back in office all without having to prop up an aging candidate facing widespread public doubt about his ability to continue leading.  *Before anyone takes issue with the first sentence of my post and ignores the rest of it: no Joe Biden‚Äôs administration hasn‚Äôt been perfect but they‚Äôve done a lot of things I‚Äôm really happy with. Much of it has been smaller regulatory sort of moves that don‚Äôt get a lot of media attention but that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ kind of what I want in a government administrator?

On thing that works for him is the clock. The longer he can hang on the better for him. The Democrats really can‚Äôt replace him the day before the convention. That would be an unmitigated disaster. If he survives the next 2 weeks he‚Äôs probably safe. Biden is a little bit like a sports team with a small lead and the clock is ticking. He is just running out the clock.   One thing working in Biden‚Äôs favor (but which nobody will say out loud) is that many Democrats believe if he is replaced by Kamala Harris the ticket will lose droves of older working-class white men who have no interest whatsoever in a Black woman as president. But if he is replaced by someone other than Harris Black women will be furious. There is no Plan B. ‚Ä¶ Biden probably won‚Äôt listen to them but he might listen to his campaign finance manager. The problem is that donations are drying up. The July haul looks to be less than half the June haul. The donors don‚Äôt think he can win and don‚Äôt want to waste their money on him.

I‚Äôll admit to viewing Jill Biden‚Äôs fishnet stockings as tacky and inappropriate. I also feel she has deep seated insecurities requiring everyone to address her as ‚ÄúDoctor.‚Äù In America it is our custom to ONLY address Medical Doctors as ‚ÄúDoctor‚Ä¶.‚Äù in ALL settings for PRACTICAL reasons: in the event of a MEDICAL emergency it‚Äôs good to know there‚Äôs a ‚Äúdoctor in the house.‚Äù  Honorary doctorates and/or doctorates in education are relativelyeasy to achieve. Jill Biden‚Äôs (community college) Ed.D is NOT recognized outside of her community college academic settings.  Not to be outdone by her husband the POTUS. Mrs. Biden ordered the Marine Corps Band to compose theme music solely to accompany her honorary FLOTUS position.  Hail to the Chief is dedicated to our American POTUS but Jill felt she also deserved an entrance song and Fanfare for the First Lady was born.  ‚ÄúThose in the Marine Corps Band said they‚Äôd never been asked to do an exclusive First Lady entrance theme before. &quot;Someone in the White House apparently ‚Äòhad the bright idea ‚ÄòOh tell the band that we want music for Jill‚Äù a source said. &#x27;The band had to provide music‚Äô‚Äú Adams reported.‚Äù  Jill Biden apparently has her own ‚ÄòHail to the Chief‚Äô-style entrance theme courtesy of the Marine Corps band Becket Adams January 4 2022   Jill Biden apparently has her own walk-up music now.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; The Marine Corps band was instructed last fall to come up with an entrance theme for the first lady a source told the Washington Examiner. The band now has in its repertoire an original composition titled ‚ÄúFanfare for the First Lady.‚Äù The song the source said is essentially Jill Biden‚Äôs personal ‚ÄúHail to the Chief‚Äù in that it is to be performed and repeated at official White House functions from her first appearance until she is ready to speak.  ‚ÄúFanfare for the First Lady‚Äù has created both amusement and confusion within the band with some remarking that in the many years they‚Äôve played in the group this is the first time the group has had to provide the first lady with an exclusive entrance theme.  Someone in the White House apparently ‚Äúhad the bright idea ‚ÄòOh tell the band that we want music for Jill&#x27;‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúThe band had to provide music.‚Äù  The band was ‚Äúrushed‚Äù to provide the entrance song for the first lady the source said adding the Marine Corps band submitted a few options for the White House‚Äôs consideration. The first lady‚Äôs handlers settled eventually on the original piece ‚ÄúFanfare to the First Lady.‚Äù  Michael LaRosa Jill Biden‚Äôs press secretary says the entire story is bunkum.  ‚ÄúThe first lady does not have a song anybody has written for her specifically. She has no ‚ÄòHail to the Chief‚Äô song. She has no song‚Äù he told the Washington Examiner. ‚ÄúShe never asked anyone to create a song.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe White House asked nobody not one person to compose an exclusive entry song or any song for the first lady‚Äù LaRosa added. ‚ÄúNone of that is accurate.‚Äù  In fact he said ‚ÄúFanfare for the First Lady‚Äù was the band‚Äôs idea. He said the band approached the White House with a proposal for new music. ‚ÄúFanfare for the First Lady‚Äù wasn‚Äôt even initially written for Jill Biden he continued adding it‚Äôs simply a finalized version of a piece of music that was already nearly completed when the band first broached the topic with the White House.  ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt ask for it‚Äù LaRosa said. ‚ÄúThey came and presented us the option. We had no idea it would even be used again.‚Äù  The Marine Corps band has made a recording of ‚ÄúFanfare for the First Lady‚Äù to be played in its absence.  Though it‚Äôs not unusual for the group‚Äôs arrangers to be asked to compose music at a moment‚Äôs notice a source told the Washington Examiner it is unusual for the first lady to have her own entrance theme. The cherry on top giving the first lady the ‚ÄúHail to the Chief‚Äù treatment the source said is this: ‚ÄúThe music is just awful.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe song is terrible‚Äù the source said adding it‚Äôs ironic a ‚Äúcompletely bogus premise‚Äù should result in such an ‚Äúawful‚Äù final product.  The Marine Corps band which did not respond to the Washington Examiner‚Äôs request for comment has performed ‚ÄúFanfare for the First Lady‚Äù at least twice already including in October of last year for a Teacher of the Year event held at the White House:  It would be ‚Äúhighly unusual‚Äù if the White House instructed the Marine Corps band to compose an entrance song exclusively for the first lady White House historian Tevi Troy told the Washington Examiner.  However he added it wouldn‚Äôt be the first time something like this has happened.  In the 1980s Troy said then-President Ronald Reagan‚Äôs onetime chief of staff Donald Regan similarly demanded the band compose an entrance song just for him much to the chagrin of then-White House deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver and then-U.S. Secretary of the Treasury James Baker.  Regan Troy writes was ‚Äúimperious insisting on all kinds of pomp and circumstance. When traveling with the president Regan demanded that he get his own introduction as White House chief of staff. Baker and Deaver were mortified when they found out ‚Äî a bad sign for Regan.‚Äù  He adds ‚ÄúA joke went around the White House about the possibility of Regan becoming a Catholic cardinal and why that would be an improvement: ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs good now‚Äô the joke went ‚Äòwe‚Äôll only have to kiss his ring.‚Äô‚Äù  Regan by the way didn‚Äôt last long as Reagan‚Äôs chief of staff. He was booted from the role after a little more than two years on the job.  Dr. Mrs. the first lady on the other hand is here for the entirety of her husband‚Äôs presidency so expect to hear ‚ÄúFanfare for the First Lady‚Äù for the next couple of years.  No word yet on whether we should expect an entrance song for second gentleman Doug Emhoff.  This story has been updated with a comment from the White House.  Further Update: April 13 2022.  The U.S. Marine Band has retired ‚ÄúFanfare for the First Lady‚Äù from its repertoire the Washington Examiner has learned. The song was removed quietly following the publication of this article a source said. One source attributed the decision to pull the composition from rotation to ‚Äúnegative‚Äù news coverage. We hope the first lady can forgive us for killing her entrance theme.

While it has garnered a significant base of support it has also raised concerns about its potential dangers. This blog post explores the various aspects of the MAGA movement analyzing its possible risks and the implications for the future of American society.  Historical Context  The MAGA movement originated during Donald Trump‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign with the slogan ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù appealing to many Americans who felt left behind by globalization and economic changes. The movement‚Äôs core message was to restore America‚Äôs former glory by focusing on national interests reducing immigration and renegotiating trade deals.  Potential Dangers  1. Polarization and Division  One of the most significant dangers of the MAGA movement is its contribution to political polarization and division. The rhetoric often used by its leaders and supporters can be divisive pitting different groups against each other based on factors such as race religion or political affiliation. This polarization can lead to a fractured society where constructive dialogue becomes difficult and consensus on critical issues is nearly impossible to achieve.  The Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement spearheaded by former President Donald Trump has sparked significant controversy and raised concerns about its potential impact on the fabric of American society. While the movement‚Äôs rhetoric appeals to a sense of patriotism and a desire for national prosperity it has also been criticized for promoting divisive and extreme views.  One of the primary dangers associated with the MAGA movement is the perpetuation of divisive rhetoric and the potential for fueling social tensions. The movement‚Äôs narrative often portrays a stark divide between ‚Äútrue Americans‚Äù and those perceived as outsiders or threats leading to a polarized and fragmented society. This divisiveness can undermine the principles of unity inclusivity and respect for diversity that are fundamental to a healthy democracy.  Additionally the MAGA movement has been linked to the rise of extreme ideologies and fringe groups with radical agendas. While the movement itself may not explicitly endorse violence its rhetoric and messaging have been co-opted by individuals and organizations that promote hate intolerance and in some cases violent extremism. This association raises concerns about the potential normalization of extremist views and the potential for escalating tensions and conflicts.  Furthermore the MAGA movement‚Äôs skepticism towards mainstream media and its embrace of alternative sources of information have contributed to the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories. This erosion of trust in authoritative sources and the blurring of fact and fiction can undermine the ability of citizens to make informed decisions and foster an environment where disinformation thrives.  It is crucial to acknowledge that the MAGA movement represents a diverse range of perspectives and individuals and not all supporters espouse extreme or divisive views. However the concerns raised about its rhetoric associations and potential consequences for social cohesion and democratic norms should be carefully examined and addressed through open and constructive dialogue.  2. Undermining Democratic Principles: A Narrative of Decay One of the primary concerns surrounding the MAGA movement is its alleged erosion of democratic norms and institutions. Critics have pointed to the movement‚Äôs repeated allegations of widespread voter fraud and its refusal to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election as undermining trust in the electoral process. Additionally the movement‚Äôs attacks on the free press and labeling of unfavorable coverage as ‚Äúfake news‚Äù have been seen as attempts to discredit a vital component of a healthy democracy.  The MAGA movement has also been criticized for its divisive rhetoric and embrace of extreme views. The movement‚Äôs nationalist and populist messaging has been accused of fostering an ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù mentality pitting different groups against one another based on race religion or political affiliation. Additionally some fringe elements within the movement have been linked to white supremacist ideologies and conspiracy theories raising concerns about the normalization of extremist views.  Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the MAGA movement is its potential for inciting violence. The movement has been blamed for emboldening individuals and groups with a propensity for violence as evidenced by the events surrounding the January 6th insurrection at the United States Capitol. The inflammatory rhetoric and unwillingness to accept electoral outcomes have been cited as contributing factors to the violence witnessed on that day.  As the MAGA movement continues to evolve and shape political discourse it is crucial to maintain a critical and objective perspective. While the movement may resonate with some segments of the population its potential impact on democratic institutions its divisive rhetoric and its association with extremist elements and violence should be carefully examined and addressed.  3. Divisive Rhetoric and Extreme Views  The MAGA movement has been criticized for its divisive rhetoric which often targets minority groups immigrants and political opponents. Extreme views and conspiracy theories have found a foothold within certain factions of the movement fueling an ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù mentality. This polarization can erode social trust undermine democratic institutions and potentially lead to violence.  The MAGA movement has sometimes been associated with extremist groups and individuals. Events such as the Capitol riot on January 6 2021 highlight the potential for violent actions stemming from extreme ideological beliefs. The normalization of extremist rhetoric can lead to an increase in hate crimes and domestic terrorism posing a threat to public safety and national security.  The movement‚Äôs stance on immigration and its often-nationalist rhetoric can have adverse effects on minority groups. Policies perceived as anti-immigrant or exclusionary can foster an environment of fear and discrimination. This can lead to social unrest and a further divide between different communities within the country undermining the principles of equality and unity.  While the MAGA movement promises economic prosperity its protectionist and isolationist tendencies could have unintended consequences. Strained relationships with international allies trade disputes and a focus on domestic industries may hinder global competitiveness and economic growth in the long run.  It is crucial to examine the MAGA movement through an objective and fact-based lens recognizing both its potential benefits and risks. A balanced and inclusive approach grounded in democratic values and respect for diversity is essential to address the concerns raised and foster unity within the nation.  4. Strained International Relations The MAGA movement centered on ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù prioritizes domestic interests over global cooperation which can strain international relations. Policies such as renegotiating trade deals and withdrawing from international agreements reflect an isolationist stance that may provoke tensions with other nations. This approach risks diminishing America‚Äôs influence globally by reducing its role in collaborative efforts and undermining established alliances. The emphasis on unilateral actions could hinder international cooperation on crucial issues like climate change security and economic stability. Furthermore it may isolate the United States diplomatically weakening its ability to shape global policies and responses effectively. In essence while ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù policies aim to prioritize national interests they potentially sacrifice broader international partnerships and leadership roles impacting both global stability and America‚Äôs standing on the world stage.  Conclusion While the MAGA movement has undoubtedly resonated with a significant portion of the American population it is essential to consider its potential dangers. The risks of increased polarization erosion of democratic norms rise of extremism negative impact on minority groups and strained international relations are serious concerns that need to be addressed. Moving forward all political movements must strive for unity uphold democratic principles and promote inclusivity to ensure a stable and prosperous future for all Americans.  By understanding and acknowledging these potential dangers we can work towards mitigating them and fostering a more cohesive and resilient society.,2024-07-11 21:58:29 GMT
19,Joe Biden,['politics'  'kamala harris'  'donald trump'  'probably not going to engage with people who misread or argue with this in bad faith'  'but feel free to reblog'],lesserjoke,Personally I think Joe Biden has done a much better job as president than most people give him credit for* (and certainly better than Donald Trump did / would have done if reelected last time). I also think that a presidential administration is far more than one person and when I vote for a candidate I‚Äôm thinking of the policy platform their team at large will work towards implementing not to mention issues like the Supreme Court and lower-bench nominations. I know I‚Äôll be voting in November for the Democratic nominee over Trump or any other Republican because I firmly believe that that choice will lead to better outcomes across the board.  At the same time I think the concerns people have about Biden‚Äôs health these days are totally justified that his VP Kamala Harris could seamlessly take over as candidate and do a better job defending / advocating for their administration‚Äôs record and future plans and that every day the campaign spends arguing with critics about that is one fewer day they can devote to pounding the case against Donald Trump in the popular imagination. Undecided swing voters and people who might sit out the election entirely need to be inspired by the Democratic platform not just convinced to fall in line and ignore the reasonable questions about Biden‚Äôs continued viability.  In short: the 2020 presidential election was largely a referendum on Trump which Joe Biden won handily. 2024 is shaping up to be a referendum on Biden ‚Äì and particularly on his future potential not his past record ‚Äì that he is not nearly as well-suited to win. A campaign shakeup of a different nominee would let the Democrats argue both the strengths of what he‚Äôs achieved and the dangers of letting Trump back in office all without having to prop up an aging candidate facing widespread public doubt about his ability to continue leading.  *Before anyone takes issue with the first sentence of my post and ignores the rest of it: no Joe Biden‚Äôs administration hasn‚Äôt been perfect but they‚Äôve done a lot of things I‚Äôm really happy with. Much of it has been smaller regulatory sort of moves that don‚Äôt get a lot of media attention but that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ kind of what I want in a government administrator? Anyway here‚Äôs an example of some of the stuff they‚Äôve achieved over the past three-and-a-half years.,2024-07-11 21:51:08 GMT

13,Joe Biden,['us politics'  'trans rights'],sniperct,It Doesn‚Äôt Matter That I Like Joe Biden  While I recommend reading the whole thing I‚Äôm just going to quote a few bits from this person‚Äôs experience back in 2019:  I introduced myself thanked him for his support of same-sex marriage in those early days in 2012 and asked my question about trans rights. While I was doing this Mr. Biden had casually taken my hand and held it in his own between our chests like it was the most natural thing in the world. He stared intently with kind eyes. I might as well have been the only person in the room. When I got to the trans rights question his demeanor suddenly changed. He got very serious his eyes sharpened and still holding my hand in his own he took his other hand and pointed a finger at my chest and said:   ‚ÄúI am in this fight with you. Trans rights are human rights.‚Äù   He then talked with me for several minutes about trans equality offered up a surprisingly informed policy nuance (even for him) and told me unreservedly he had our backs. He then gave me a hug. And left.     He wasn‚Äôt my first choice. Or my second or third choice before that little chat. But of all the candidates with whom I spoke it was Mr. Biden by a country mile who impressed me the most.   Yet it‚Äôs not enough to like someone. It‚Äôs not. There are politicians whom I like quite a lot that I wouldn‚Äôt trust with the presidency. I would much rather trust a highly competent and capable politician whom I don‚Äôt like than one I like but in whom I can‚Äôt quite vouch for their competency and capability.   It‚Äôs not enough for me to simply like Mr. Biden. Given the grave and immediate threat to our democracy and the overwhelming sense of survival I have voting in this election it‚Äôs just not enough to like him.     I‚Äôve watched as he has centered trans rights as an imperative in his administration. I have been consistently been touched with the way in which he has refused to back down in support of the trans community. I have watched as he‚Äôs rejected calls‚Äîmany public and I assume many private‚Äîto wholly abandon the trans community.   He refuses.   I believe Mr. Biden is our best choice to win in the fall. I understand there are many who disagree with me and that‚Äôs fine. Reasonable adults can disagree. I respect the understandable concern many have expressed.   But respectfully Joe Biden has earned my trust many times over and I know deep down there‚Äôs no one I‚Äôd rather have fighting for me in this moment. I believe in Joe Biden especially given how unfailingly he‚Äôs believed in me.   I don‚Äôt give a damn what political media says particularly since their alleged craving for competency seems to largely fail in holding Donald Trump accountable on his pervasive litany of illegal and immoral failings.,2024-07-12 02:42:30 GMT

142,Joe Biden,['...okay i might have gotten a little riled up but god'  'us politics'  'politics tw'],lady-raziel,I‚Äôm angry. I‚Äôm really really furious right now. I am absolutely livid that when the stakes are so high‚Äì not just for Americans at risk from project 2025 not just for people in Europe being threatened by Russia not just for people in Palestine but for pretty much widespread global stability‚Äì that the elites of the Democratic party would dare would have the fucking gall to let Joe Biden run for a second term in the first place and then when the magnitude of their own hubris is revealed would not correct the mistake. And even worse now after what we‚Äôve seen over the past two weeks‚Äì that many of them including some of the most progressive would look out upon the people who they claim to be champions of the diverse and varied America who will suffer at the hands of the conservatives‚Äô agenda‚Äìand they would EVER dare to say that YOU are wrong to point out the truth before your own eyes.   After the NATO press conference where Biden absolutely had to prove he was not on the decline and resoundingly failed to do so I was appalled to go on Twitter (I‚Äôm still not calling it X sorry) and see favored Democratic insiders claiming that the performance I had just seen was GOOD. That I should be PROUD of this. That I should WANT to vote for this.  How dare you. How dare you say that I should be proud should wholeheartedly endorse the candidate at the head of a party who time and time again over the past 30+ years has only ever chosen to raise up its own aging elites and occasionally younger people if they met the right demographics to portray the image of the ‚Äúdiverse party of the people.‚Äù   No. It became evident a long time ago that you only ever cared about yourselves and consolidating your own power. Time and time again you have destroyed the chances of any candidate that strays beyond what you consider the bounds of acceptability for yourselves. There were good candidates in 2004‚Äì and instead the Democrats gave us John Kerry and handed the Republicans another four years of Bush. Hillary Clinton first ran for president in 2008‚Äì had Barack Obama not been so compelling had the idea of having the first African American president been so appealing would you have allowed him to stand a chance? In 2016 you again and again ignored what the average person had to say ignored concerns that had been brewing for decades that your commitment to ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù only mattered if it could be wielded against conservatives and used to prop yourselves up and destroyed Bernie Sanders‚Äô campaign in service of an elite no one wanted.   The seeds of Donald Trump had been brewing for a long time and instead of doing something about it then you rested on your laurels and held on to your power instead of raising new people up to move the mission forward. And now when the situation is MORE CRITICAL than it has EVER been‚Äì still you refuse to listen. Still you refuse to change. Biden literally said in that press conference they aren‚Äôt listening to polls anymore‚Äìis there ANYTHING that will get you to see that you are fucking this up???  So no Biden campaign surrogates on my Twitter feed DNC donation-prompt texts endless barrage of emails one after another‚Äì I see no reason to my proud of this. For many of us this election as well as the last one was ALWAYS a strategic calculation to prevent worse things empower local-level candidates and allow a party structure to exist in some form in hopes of change. This was ALWAYS a dispassionate choice made with the full knowledge of complex situations in order to play the long game.   How dare you say I too should wholeheartedly believe the emperor is dressed in robes of splendor when he and the rest of you have lain bare for the longest time while those of us trying to keep things from getting worse have to convince the rightfully angry people who still care to ignore the nakedness of who you are‚Äìto prevent people cloaked in blood from taking the reins. Shame on all of you honestly. I wish I could say that this might be a learning moment for the Democratic elite but I have little hope and I expect to hear you pontificate on end regarding how ‚Äúyoung people just don‚Äôt understand the political process and that‚Äôs why we lost‚Äù as we all go down together.

The primaries are over and the voters have decided on Biden knowing he was no spring chicken. Two of America‚Äôs arguably best presidents FDR and Woodrow Wilson experienced periods of infirmity during their terms of office. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they stick Biden in a rocking chair for four more years and let his aides run around and do everything. That‚Äôs especially true considering how unacceptable his opponent is and the danger he and his allies pose to the survival of our democracy.  All the newshounds slathering for the latest morsel of gossip about Biden‚Äôs latest gaffe will be mortally embarrassed if their yellow journalism results in Trump‚Äôs election. They may find themselves censored even arrested for any coverage that doesn‚Äôt paint Dear Leader in the most glowing terms.

While I was doing this Mr. Biden had casually taken my hand and held it in his own between our chests like it was the most natural thing in the world. He stared intently with kind eyes. I might as well have been the only person in the room. When I got to the trans rights question his demeanor suddenly changed. He got very serious his eyes sharpened and still holding my hand in his own he took his other hand and pointed a finger at my chest and said:   ‚ÄúI am in this fight with you. Trans rights are human rights.‚Äù   He then talked with me for several minutes about trans equality offered up a surprisingly informed policy nuance (even for him) and told me unreservedly he had our backs. He then gave me a hug. And left.     He wasn‚Äôt my first choice. Or my second or third choice before that little chat. But of all the candidates with whom I spoke it was Mr. Biden by a country mile who impressed me the most.   Yet it‚Äôs not enough to like someone. It‚Äôs not. There are politicians whom I like quite a lot that I wouldn‚Äôt trust with the presidency. I would much rather trust a highly competent and capable politician whom I don‚Äôt like than one I like but in whom I can‚Äôt quite vouch for their competency and capability.   It‚Äôs not enough for me to simply like Mr. Biden. Given the grave and immediate threat to our democracy and the overwhelming sense of survival I have voting in this election it‚Äôs just not enough to like him.     I‚Äôve watched as he has centered trans rights as an imperative in his administration. I have been consistently been touched with the way in which he has refused to back down in support of the trans community. I have watched as he‚Äôs rejected calls‚Äîmany public and I assume many private‚Äîto wholly abandon the trans community.   He refuses.   I believe Mr. Biden is our best choice to win in the fall. I understand there are many who disagree with me and that‚Äôs fine. Reasonable adults can disagree. I respect the understandable concern many have expressed.

0,Joe Biden,['blacklivesmatter'  'blackvotersmatters'  'donald trump'  'naacp'  'blackmediamatters'  'blackvotersmatter'  'news'  'ados'  'youtube'],rauthschild,When we were going to school we had two textbooks one called ‚ÄúAmerican History‚Äù and one called ‚ÄúUnited States History‚Äù. These are two separate entities and two separate histories.   The American Government is a ‚Äúrepublican form of government‚Äù from its roots at the county level to its top offices and institutions.   It is not now and never has been a democracy.   There is a profound difference between our unincorporated Federation of States doing business as The United States of America and a British Crown Corporation merely calling itself ‚Äúthe United States of America Incorporated‚Äù.   It is the same gulf that stands between a woman named Monique Pressley and a British Crown Corporation calling itself MONIQUE PRESSLEY.   Our unincorporated Union States each one composed of all the living people populating all the unincorporated Counties within their State borders created both the Federation of States (1776) and the Confederation of States (1781) as unincorporated instrumentalities.   What does that mean? Both the Federation and the Confederation were designed and intended to work for the Union States in international and global venues as ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù or ‚Äúagents‚Äù to conduct business.   The American Confederation created in 1781 was additionally awarded a Constitutional Service Contract in 1787.  This original Confederation did business as ‚Äúthe States of America‚Äù and the Constitutional Contract it was awarded was called ‚ÄúThe Constitution for the united States of America‚Äù.   This original Confederation ran the resulting Federal Republic from 1787 to 1861 when it lost the quorum of its member States-of-States organizations needed to conduct business.   As a direct result of this failure to maintain unity the Federal Republic (the American Federal Subcontractor providing government services under The Constitution for the united States of America) and its members all known as ‚ÄúState Republics‚Äù (land) or ‚ÄúRepublics of State‚Äù (sea) also lost the ability to function.   A third of our original American Government and a third of the Federal Government (the American third) were both taken out of service by the so-called Civil War and never reconstructed afterward.   What remains of the American Government are the Union States holding our National Soil Jurisdiction and our Federation of States holding our International and Global jurisdictions.   What remains of the ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù Federal Government are the British Territorial Subcontractors and the Holy Roman Empire Subcontractors and/or their Successors.   Think of it as a six-celled combustion engine running on four cylinders.   The American Government is still fully functional despite these injuries; we retain concurrent and superior general jurisdiction over the actual physical Counties and States and maintain their mutual powers internationally and globally via our Federation of States.   The ‚ÄúUS‚Äù Government continues to unravel in a heap of European intrigue criminality and deceit having pulled off a huge scam amounting to a national-level identity theft and impersonation scheme against their American Employers and the American Government.   The incorporated ‚ÄúUnited States Government‚Äù entities are functionally bankrupt and only being limped along by colluding banks that are continuing to bar us from access to our own assets and pretending that these white collar criminals are our representatives and custodians.   Any such presumption is unsupported.   Lately Mr. Trump and his followers all acting knowingly or unknowingly as British Territorial Officers and Crew members of a British Crown Corporation calling itself ‚Äúthe United States of America Inc.‚Äù have proposed that they will either: (1) invade and inhabit our still unreconstructed American Federal Republic or (2) substitute a British Territorial knock-off perhaps a corporate franchise calling itself ‚Äúthe Federal Republic Incorporated‚Äù for our Federal Republic.   We return the favor and counterclaim that they return to their base in the District of Columbia do their jobs according to their contract and cease and desist all efforts to misrepresent us or defraud us further.   These British Territorial Mercenaries are already functioning under the deceptive name of ‚Äúthe American Government Inc.‚Äù which we don‚Äôt appreciate and which we want everyone to be aware of.   These matters and issues must be faced and resolved. We have seen enough British Territorial ‚Äúmischief‚Äù ‚Äî crime and abuse bad faith false claims and war-mongering ‚Äî to last several centuries.   We are calling upon the rest of the world indeed on everyone reading these words to take immediate action to stop the British Nazis behind this attempt to steal our national identity impersonate us and lead this entire planet into another grisly war-for-profit.   This morning a friend sent me a quote from Germany in 1932 ‚Äî Adolph Hitler another charismatic political leader acting as Pied Piper saying quote:   ‚ÄúThe nation is threatened from within and without. This is not a time for half-measures. It is time to make ourselves great again. And on that day heads will roll in the dust. ‚Äì Adolf Hitler 1932‚Äù  Where have we heard this ‚ÄúMake ourselves great again‚Äù slogan before? And now see the same ‚Äúset up‚Äù being applied to America? A charismatic political leader? An economic downfall precipitated by an incompetent military government? Hyper-inflation?   Fiat currency?   The set up supporting Hitler and Trump is exactly the same right down to the ‚ÄúGay Agenda‚Äù.   Hitler used gay brown shirt political capos to put him in power using promises of normalization and justice; of course he then had them deposed and murdered the moment he took power.   So now we have Joe Biden espousing the rainbow flag and promising the same things to get the sexual ‚Äúspectrum‚Äù to come out of the closet ‚Äì where Trump can identify them and blame them and lead a rampage against the imaginary target they provide.   Anything to keep public attention focused away from Trump‚Äôs own participation in and support of the Pandemic Genocide.   Bottom line Trump is a business tycoon Joe Biden is a hack and both of them are tainted ‚Äîwith no reasonable replacements standing in line and all within spitting distance of the British Territorial ‚ÄúNational‚Äù Corporate Elections.   Why are these same deceptive run-amok foreign for-profit ‚Äúgovernmental services corporations‚Äù still assuming that they have any authority or part to play in determining the future of our world or our country?   They don‚Äôt. Apart from us and apart from following our instructions and earning their pay ‚Äì in gold or silver ‚Äì they don‚Äôt have a pot.   They are exposed caught denuded red-handed paws in the cookie jar up to their shoulder joints and they still think they can brazen it out and not only fool the Autochthonous American Nationals but the rest of the world as well?   This ‚Äúshow‚Äù is not only over for the Communist Union leaders and their Municipal Empire and the municipal corporations that have been used as storefronts for that cabal; the ‚Äúshow‚Äù is over for the British Territorial Empire and their corporations too. No more substitution frauds.   We have claimed their corporate debt as our credit; delegalized their remedies for lack of performance; updated our Sovereign Patents in all three major jurisdictions as of 2015; reclaimed our assets and birthright status; served Due Process; issued our Judgement; cured everything; and rolled it all into private and public trusts subject to one Irrevocable Will that is firmly recorded and distributed world wide.   That Will is entirely in favor of the living people not the corporations. Everyone gets their purloined stuff back. The guilty corporations are either liquidated permanently or forfeited and placed under new management. The criminals go to jail. The honorable members of the military and various units of government are granted amnesty.  Te Deum. That and our completely new clean and uncomplicated banking system is really all that is needed to restore sanity and to birth a new era of peace and plenty for everyone.   Everyone who wants to know more also gets a free education about actual Law and History and Science ‚Äî not the twisted politicized suppressed and dumbed-down pablum that has been the stock and trade of our schools and universities for over a century.,2024-07-12 05:38:08 GMT

If he had actual full-on dementia he could not possibly be doing what he‚Äôs currently doing. It‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs being stretched to his limits right now but full-scale dementia would have already seen those limits completely broken; he‚Äôd be seeing the aides next to him as family members or forgetting where he is and it would either take a noticeable amount of time to clear the fog from his mind or it would just straight-up not be possible to do that.   But I‚Äôve seen dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs in action with my grandfather. And do you know how it started? It started with slipups that he was aware of. He would forget things but he knew he was forgetting them which made it easier to talk and work with him but also made it way sadder since he knew he was slipping and wasn‚Äôt going to get any better(and because he‚Äôd try to downplay it whenever possible so we wouldn‚Äôt worry because God bless him his kids and grandkids were his primary concern right up till the end). And my personal tragedies aside that‚Äôs kind of what it looks like with Biden now. He‚Äôs cognizant enough to realize when he‚Äôs made a mistake by introducing Zelenskyy as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù(he caught himself and the very next thing he said was an acknowledgement something like ‚ÄúPresident Putin? You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs gonna beat President Putin!) but not cognizant enough to stop that mistake from being made. And there‚Äôs an argument to be made that the close connection in his brain(both men do have the exact same title) made the slipup more likely than other possible ones. &quot;Vice President Trump‚Äù in reference to Kamala on the other hand is less so. There the connection was less close-he was talking about how he picked her because he believed she could beat Trump. Again we‚Äôre hardly at levels of ‚Äúmistaking the guy next to me for Abe Lincoln‚Äù or whatever but it‚Äôs getting worse and it will not get better unless a revolutionary new medicine or treatment(and by ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù I mean on the scale of penicillin for antibiotics or insulin for diabetes) for age-related mental health issues is made available to the public in the next year or less. Which is simply not going to happen.,2024-07-12 06:57:50 GMT

8,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'the new york times'  'los angeles times'  'editorials'  '2024 presidential election'  '2024 elections'],justinspoliticalcorner,Both the New York Times and LA Times released editorials correctly labeling Donald Trump unfit to lead New York Times editorial (07.11.2024): Next week for the third time in eight years Donald Trump will be nominated as the Republican Party‚Äôs candidate for president of the United States. A once great political party now serves the interests of one man a man as demonstrably unsuited for the office of president as any to run in the long history of the Republic a man whose values temperament ideas and language are directly opposed to so much of what has made this country great.   It is a chilling choice against this national moment. For more than two decades large majorities of Americans have said they are dissatisfied with the direction of the country and the post-Covid era of stubborn inflation high interest rates social division and political stagnation has left many voters even more frustrated and despondent.  The Republican Party once pursued electoral power in service to solutions for such problems to building ‚Äúthe shining city on a hill‚Äù as Ronald Reagan liked to say. Its vision of the United States ‚Äî embodied in principled public servants like George H.W. Bush John McCain and Mitt Romney ‚Äî was rooted in the values of freedom sacrifice individual responsibility and the common good. The party‚Äôs conception of those values was reflected in its longstanding conservative policy agenda and today many Republicans set aside their concerns about Mr. Trump because of his positions on immigration trade and taxes. But the stakes of this election are not fundamentally about policy disagreements. The stakes are more foundational: what qualities matter most in America‚Äôs president and commander in chief.  Mr. Trump has shown a character unworthy of the responsibilities of the presidency. He has demonstrated an utter lack of respect for the Constitution the rule of law and the American people. Instead of a cogent vision for the country‚Äôs future Mr. Trump is animated by a thirst for political power: to use the levers of government to advance his interests satisfy his impulses and exact retribution against those who he thinks have wronged him.   He is quite simply unfit to lead.  The Democrats are rightly engaged in their own debate about whether President Biden is the right person to carry the party‚Äôs nomination into the election given widespread concerns among voters about his age-related fitness. This debate is so intense because of legitimate concerns that Mr. Trump may present a danger to the country its strength security and national character ‚Äî and that a compelling Democratic alternative is the only thing that would prevent his return to power. It is a national tragedy that the Republicans have failed to have a similar debate about the manifest moral and temperamental unfitness of their standard-bearer instead setting aside their longstanding values closing ranks and choosing to overlook what those who worked most closely with the former president have described as his systematic dishonesty corruption cruelty and incompetence.   That task now falls to the American people. We urge voters to see the dangers of a second Trump term clearly and to reject it. The stakes and significance of the presidency demand a person who has essential qualities and values to earn our trust and on each one Donald Trump fails.     Los Angeles Times editorial (07.11.2024): Democrats are in crisis at the moment divided over whether President Biden should stay in the race after his disastrous debate last month or clear the way for another younger candidate.   Biden‚Äôs shaky performance raised concerns about whether he can win in November and prompted calls from prominent Democrats columnists and others for him to step aside. It‚Äôs up to the Democratic Party to sort this out. But it‚Äôs time to refocus attention on the only candidate in the race who is patently unfit for office ‚Äî any office ‚Äî and an imminent threat to democracy: Donald Trump.   It‚Äôs unbelievable that the nation is spending so much time on the question of Biden‚Äôs verbal acuity when the greatest concern ought to be that his challenger is a self-aggrandizing felon and twice-impeached election-denier. Trump fomented the Jan. 6 insurrection shows contempt for the rule of law and shamelessly lies in pursuit of more power. He‚Äôs an authoritarian who admires murderous despots wants to jail his political enemies and has publicly flirted with declaring himself a dictator on his first day back in office.  ‚Ä¶   Trump is the only man in the presidential race manifestly unworthy of holding a position of power and has no business ever returning to the White House. If the GOP had any decency left its members would be discussing whether to dump Trump for a candidate who isn‚Äôt out to bulldoze democratic institutions in favor of autocracy.   Voters should resist viewing this contest through the politics-as-usual lens of past elections. This November is not about dueling personalities middle-of-the-road policy differences or as some might see it an 81-year-old man being the lesser of two evils compared with a 78-year-old man. It‚Äôs nothing short of a referendum on our 248-year democracy and a choice between a trustworthy public servant who upholds American values and a serial liar who wants to push the country into authoritarianism.        Both the New York Times and the LA Times have released editorials rightly declaring the cognitively-challenged insurrection-inciting 34x convicted felon Donald Trump unfit to lead the nation for a 2nd term.

Biden offered extensive remarks on thorny foreign policy issues including competition with China and the Israel-Hamas war in which he said he had warned Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu away from an occupation of the Gaza Strip.   He said he was directly in contact with Xi Jinping to warn him not to offer further support for Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine but not with Vladimir Putin whom he said: ‚ÄúI have no reason to speak to him right now.‚Äù  But Biden who is running to be president until January 2029 fielded an equal number of questions during the press conference on his mental fitness an issue that has loomed over his campaign since a faltering debate performance against Donald Trump that he called ‚Äúthat dumb mistake‚Äù.   Ultimately it was a performance that supporters will probably say shows he is capable of handling his responsibilities as commander-in-chief but unlikely to convince those already in doubt about his mental fitness that he can serve another four years in office.   Biden 81 insisted he would stay in the race despite calls from some in his party to drop out and to allow another figure including Harris run in the November election.  ‚Ä¶ Biden said he wouldn‚Äôt leave the race unless polls showed him that he had no chance of winning against Trump even if they showed that Harris‚Äôs chances in the election were better than his own.   Nonetheless he said Harris was qualified to be president as well although he misnamed her in the endorsement. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have picked vice-president Trump to be vice-president if she‚Äôs not qualified to be president‚Äù he said.   That gaffe was compounded by the fact that he had introduced the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù just hours earlier before correcting himself and saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to beat Putin.‚Äù   Biden initially used the final Nato summit press conference as something of a stump speech brandishing his national security record in supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression and saying that the November vote was ‚Äúmuch more than a political question ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a national security issue.‚Äù  He then turned to his record on the economy border security and his efforts to broker a peace in the Israel-Hamas war to bolster his case for his campaign in November.   Biden spoke for 58 minutes including 50 minutes of unscripted question-and-answer. He appeared most comfortable and cogent as he discussed thorny foreign policy questions.     Joe Biden gave an alright presser in which he made a gaffe in which he mixed up the names of his VP and principal challenger when he said ‚ÄúVice President Trump.‚Äù Prior to the presser Biden mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù before correcting himself.

If he had actual full-on dementia he could not possibly be doing what he‚Äôs currently doing. It‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs being stretched to his limits right now but full-scale dementia would have already seen those limits completely broken; he‚Äôd be seeing the aides next to him as family members or forgetting where he is and it would either take a noticeable amount of time to clear the fog from his mind or it would just straight-up not be possible to do that.   But I‚Äôve seen dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs in action with my grandfather. And do you know how it started? It started with slipups that he was aware of. He would forget things but he knew he was forgetting them which made it easier to talk and work with him but also made it way sadder since he knew he was slipping and wasn‚Äôt going to get any better(and because he‚Äôd try to downplay it whenever possible so we wouldn‚Äôt worry because God bless him his kids and grandkids were his primary concern right up till the end). And my personal tragedies aside that‚Äôs kind of what it looks like with Biden now. He‚Äôs cognizant enough to realize when he‚Äôs made a mistake by introducing Zelenskyy as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù(he caught himself and the very next thing he said was an acknowledgement something like ‚ÄúPresident Putin? You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs gonna beat President Putin!) but not cognizant enough to stop that mistake from being made. And there‚Äôs an argument to be made that the close connection in his brain(both men do have the exact same title) made the slipup more likely than other possible ones. &quot;Vice President Trump‚Äù in reference to Kamala on the other hand is less so. There the connection was less close-he was talking about how he picked her because he believed she could beat Trump. Again we‚Äôre hardly at levels of ‚Äúmistaking the guy next to me for Abe Lincoln‚Äù or whatever but it‚Äôs getting worse and it will not get better unless a revolutionary new medicine or treatment(and by ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù I mean on the scale of penicillin for antibiotics or insulin for diabetes) for age-related mental health issues is made available to the public in the next year or less. Which is simply not going to happen.,2024-07-12 06:57:50 GMT

0,Joe Biden,['blacklivesmatter'  'blackvotersmatters'  'donald trump'  'naacp'  'blackmediamatters'  'blackvotersmatter'  'news'  'ados'  'youtube'],rauthschild,When we were going to school we had two textbooks one called ‚ÄúAmerican History‚Äù and one called ‚ÄúUnited States History‚Äù. These are two separate entities and two separate histories.   The American Government is a ‚Äúrepublican form of government‚Äù from its roots at the county level to its top offices and institutions.   It is not now and never has been a democracy.   There is a profound difference between our unincorporated Federation of States doing business as The United States of America and a British Crown Corporation merely calling itself ‚Äúthe United States of America Incorporated‚Äù.   It is the same gulf that stands between a woman named Monique Pressley and a British Crown Corporation calling itself MONIQUE PRESSLEY.   Our unincorporated Union States each one composed of all the living people populating all the unincorporated Counties within their State borders created both the Federation of States (1776) and the Confederation of States (1781) as unincorporated instrumentalities.   What does that mean? Both the Federation and the Confederation were designed and intended to work for the Union States in international and global venues as ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù or ‚Äúagents‚Äù to conduct business.   The American Confederation created in 1781 was additionally awarded a Constitutional Service Contract in 1787.  This original Confederation did business as ‚Äúthe States of America‚Äù and the Constitutional Contract it was awarded was called ‚ÄúThe Constitution for the united States of America‚Äù.   This original Confederation ran the resulting Federal Republic from 1787 to 1861 when it lost the quorum of its member States-of-States organizations needed to conduct business.   As a direct result of this failure to maintain unity the Federal Republic (the American Federal Subcontractor providing government services under The Constitution for the united States of America) and its members all known as ‚ÄúState Republics‚Äù (land) or ‚ÄúRepublics of State‚Äù (sea) also lost the ability to function.   A third of our original American Government and a third of the Federal Government (the American third) were both taken out of service by the so-called Civil War and never reconstructed afterward.   What remains of the American Government are the Union States holding our National Soil Jurisdiction and our Federation of States holding our International and Global jurisdictions.   What remains of the ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù Federal Government are the British Territorial Subcontractors and the Holy Roman Empire Subcontractors and/or their Successors.   Think of it as a six-celled combustion engine running on four cylinders.   The American Government is still fully functional despite these injuries; we retain concurrent and superior general jurisdiction over the actual physical Counties and States and maintain their mutual powers internationally and globally via our Federation of States.   The ‚ÄúUS‚Äù Government continues to unravel in a heap of European intrigue criminality and deceit having pulled off a huge scam amounting to a national-level identity theft and impersonation scheme against their American Employers and the American Government.   The incorporated ‚ÄúUnited States Government‚Äù entities are functionally bankrupt and only being limped along by colluding banks that are continuing to bar us from access to our own assets and pretending that these white collar criminals are our representatives and custodians.   Any such presumption is unsupported.   Lately Mr. Trump and his followers all acting knowingly or unknowingly as British Territorial Officers and Crew members of a British Crown Corporation calling itself ‚Äúthe United States of America Inc.‚Äù have proposed that they will either: (1) invade and inhabit our still unreconstructed American Federal Republic or (2) substitute a British Territorial knock-off perhaps a corporate franchise calling itself ‚Äúthe Federal Republic Incorporated‚Äù for our Federal Republic.   We return the favor and counterclaim that they return to their base in the District of Columbia do their jobs according to their contract and cease and desist all efforts to misrepresent us or defraud us further.   These British Territorial Mercenaries are already functioning under the deceptive name of ‚Äúthe American Government Inc.‚Äù which we don‚Äôt appreciate and which we want everyone to be aware of.   These matters and issues must be faced and resolved. We have seen enough British Territorial ‚Äúmischief‚Äù ‚Äî crime and abuse bad faith false claims and war-mongering ‚Äî to last several centuries.   We are calling upon the rest of the world indeed on everyone reading these words to take immediate action to stop the British Nazis behind this attempt to steal our national identity impersonate us and lead this entire planet into another grisly war-for-profit.   This morning a friend sent me a quote from Germany in 1932 ‚Äî Adolph Hitler another charismatic political leader acting as Pied Piper saying quote:   ‚ÄúThe nation is threatened from within and without. This is not a time for half-measures. It is time to make ourselves great again. And on that day heads will roll in the dust. ‚Äì Adolf Hitler 1932‚Äù  Where have we heard this ‚ÄúMake ourselves great again‚Äù slogan before? And now see the same ‚Äúset up‚Äù being applied to America? A charismatic political leader? An economic downfall precipitated by an incompetent military government? Hyper-inflation?   Fiat currency?   The set up supporting Hitler and Trump is exactly the same right down to the ‚ÄúGay Agenda‚Äù.   Hitler used gay brown shirt political capos to put him in power using promises of normalization and justice; of course he then had them deposed and murdered the moment he took power.   So now we have Joe Biden espousing the rainbow flag and promising the same things to get the sexual ‚Äúspectrum‚Äù to come out of the closet ‚Äì where Trump can identify them and blame them and lead a rampage against the imaginary target they provide.   Anything to keep public attention focused away from Trump‚Äôs own participation in and support of the Pandemic Genocide.   Bottom line Trump is a business tycoon Joe Biden is a hack and both of them are tainted ‚Äîwith no reasonable replacements standing in line and all within spitting distance of the British Territorial ‚ÄúNational‚Äù Corporate Elections.   Why are these same deceptive run-amok foreign for-profit ‚Äúgovernmental services corporations‚Äù still assuming that they have any authority or part to play in determining the future of our world or our country?   They don‚Äôt. Apart from us and apart from following our instructions and earning their pay ‚Äì in gold or silver ‚Äì they don‚Äôt have a pot.   They are exposed caught denuded red-handed paws in the cookie jar up to their shoulder joints and they still think they can brazen it out and not only fool the Autochthonous American Nationals but the rest of the world as well?   This ‚Äúshow‚Äù is not only over for the Communist Union leaders and their Municipal Empire and the municipal corporations that have been used as storefronts for that cabal; the ‚Äúshow‚Äù is over for the British Territorial Empire and their corporations too. No more substitution frauds.   We have claimed their corporate debt as our credit; delegalized their remedies for lack of performance; updated our Sovereign Patents in all three major jurisdictions as of 2015; reclaimed our assets and birthright status; served Due Process; issued our Judgement; cured everything; and rolled it all into private and public trusts subject to one Irrevocable Will that is firmly recorded and distributed world wide.   That Will is entirely in favor of the living people not the corporations. Everyone gets their purloined stuff back. The guilty corporations are either liquidated permanently or forfeited and placed under new management. The criminals go to jail. The honorable members of the military and various units of government are granted amnesty.  Te Deum. That and our completely new clean and uncomplicated banking system is really all that is needed to restore sanity and to birth a new era of peace and plenty for everyone.   Everyone who wants to know more also gets a free education about actual Law and History and Science ‚Äî not the twisted politicized suppressed and dumbed-down pablum that has been the stock and trade of our schools and universities for over a century.,2024-07-12 05:38:08 GMT

Its vision of the United States ‚Äî embodied in principled public servants like George H.W. Bush John McCain and Mitt Romney ‚Äî was rooted in the values of freedom sacrifice individual responsibility and the common good. The party‚Äôs conception of those values was reflected in its longstanding conservative policy agenda and today many Republicans set aside their concerns about Mr. Trump because of his positions on immigration trade and taxes. But the stakes of this election are not fundamentally about policy disagreements. The stakes are more foundational: what qualities matter most in America‚Äôs president and commander in chief.  Mr. Trump has shown a character unworthy of the responsibilities of the presidency. He has demonstrated an utter lack of respect for the Constitution the rule of law and the American people. Instead of a cogent vision for the country‚Äôs future Mr. Trump is animated by a thirst for political power: to use the levers of government to advance his interests satisfy his impulses and exact retribution against those who he thinks have wronged him.   He is quite simply unfit to lead.  The Democrats are rightly engaged in their own debate about whether President Biden is the right person to carry the party‚Äôs nomination into the election given widespread concerns among voters about his age-related fitness. This debate is so intense because of legitimate concerns that Mr. Trump may present a danger to the country its strength security and national character ‚Äî and that a compelling Democratic alternative is the only thing that would prevent his return to power. It is a national tragedy that the Republicans have failed to have a similar debate about the manifest moral and temperamental unfitness of their standard-bearer instead setting aside their longstanding values closing ranks and choosing to overlook what those who worked most closely with the former president have described as his systematic dishonesty corruption cruelty and incompetence.   That task now falls to the American people. We urge voters to see the dangers of a second Trump term clearly and to reject it. The stakes and significance of the presidency demand a person who has essential qualities and values to earn our trust and on each one Donald Trump fails.     Los Angeles Times editorial (07.11.2024): Democrats are in crisis at the moment divided over whether President Biden should stay in the race after his disastrous debate last month or clear the way for another younger candidate.   Biden‚Äôs shaky performance raised concerns about whether he can win in November and prompted calls from prominent Democrats columnists and others for him to step aside. It‚Äôs up to the Democratic Party to sort this out. But it‚Äôs time to refocus attention on the only candidate in the race who is patently unfit for office ‚Äî any office ‚Äî and an imminent threat to democracy: Donald Trump.   It‚Äôs unbelievable that the nation is spending so much time on the question of Biden‚Äôs verbal acuity when the greatest concern ought to be that his challenger is a self-aggrandizing felon and twice-impeached election-denier. Trump fomented the Jan. 6 insurrection shows contempt for the rule of law and shamelessly lies in pursuit of more power. He‚Äôs an authoritarian who admires murderous despots wants to jail his political enemies and has publicly flirted with declaring himself a dictator on his first day back in office.  ‚Ä¶   Trump is the only man in the presidential race manifestly unworthy of holding a position of power and has no business ever returning to the White House. If the GOP had any decency left its members would be discussing whether to dump Trump for a candidate who isn‚Äôt out to bulldoze democratic institutions in favor of autocracy.   Voters should resist viewing this contest through the politics-as-usual lens of past elections. This November is not about dueling personalities middle-of-the-road policy differences or as some might see it an 81-year-old man being the lesser of two evils compared with a 78-year-old man. It‚Äôs nothing short of a referendum on our 248-year democracy and a choice between a trustworthy public servant who upholds American values and a serial liar who wants to push the country into authoritarianism.        Both the New York Times and the LA Times have released editorials rightly declaring the cognitively-challenged insurrection-inciting 34x convicted felon Donald Trump unfit to lead the nation for a 2nd term.   Vote for Joe Biden (or Kamala Harris if she is the nominee) to stop the Orange Fascist from regaining the Presidency!,2024-07-12 07:49:47 GMT

Biden offered extensive remarks on thorny foreign policy issues including competition with China and the Israel-Hamas war in which he said he had warned Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu away from an occupation of the Gaza Strip.   He said he was directly in contact with Xi Jinping to warn him not to offer further support for Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine but not with Vladimir Putin whom he said: ‚ÄúI have no reason to speak to him right now.‚Äù  But Biden who is running to be president until January 2029 fielded an equal number of questions during the press conference on his mental fitness an issue that has loomed over his campaign since a faltering debate performance against Donald Trump that he called ‚Äúthat dumb mistake‚Äù.   Ultimately it was a performance that supporters will probably say shows he is capable of handling his responsibilities as commander-in-chief but unlikely to convince those already in doubt about his mental fitness that he can serve another four years in office.   Biden 81 insisted he would stay in the race despite calls from some in his party to drop out and to allow another figure including Harris run in the November election.  ‚Ä¶ Biden said he wouldn‚Äôt leave the race unless polls showed him that he had no chance of winning against Trump even if they showed that Harris‚Äôs chances in the election were better than his own.   Nonetheless he said Harris was qualified to be president as well although he misnamed her in the endorsement. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have picked vice-president Trump to be vice-president if she‚Äôs not qualified to be president‚Äù he said.   That gaffe was compounded by the fact that he had introduced the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù just hours earlier before correcting himself and saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to beat Putin.‚Äù   Biden initially used the final Nato summit press conference as something of a stump speech brandishing his national security record in supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression and saying that the November vote was ‚Äúmuch more than a political question ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a national security issue.‚Äù  He then turned to his record on the economy border security and his efforts to broker a peace in the Israel-Hamas war to bolster his case for his campaign in November.   Biden spoke for 58 minutes including 50 minutes of unscripted question-and-answer. He appeared most comfortable and cogent as he discussed thorny foreign policy questions.     Joe Biden gave an alright presser in which he made a gaffe in which he mixed up the names of his VP and principal challenger when he said ‚ÄúVice President Trump.‚Äù Prior to the presser Biden mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù before correcting himself.

If he had actual full-on dementia he could not possibly be doing what he‚Äôs currently doing. It‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs being stretched to his limits right now but full-scale dementia would have already seen those limits completely broken; he‚Äôd be seeing the aides next to him as family members or forgetting where he is and it would either take a noticeable amount of time to clear the fog from his mind or it would just straight-up not be possible to do that.   But I‚Äôve seen dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs in action with my grandfather. And do you know how it started? It started with slipups that he was aware of. He would forget things but he knew he was forgetting them which made it easier to talk and work with him but also made it way sadder since he knew he was slipping and wasn‚Äôt going to get any better(and because he‚Äôd try to downplay it whenever possible so we wouldn‚Äôt worry because God bless him his kids and grandkids were his primary concern right up till the end). And my personal tragedies aside that‚Äôs kind of what it looks like with Biden now. He‚Äôs cognizant enough to realize when he‚Äôs made a mistake by introducing Zelenskyy as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù(he caught himself and the very next thing he said was an acknowledgement something like ‚ÄúPresident Putin? You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs gonna beat President Putin!) but not cognizant enough to stop that mistake from being made. And there‚Äôs an argument to be made that the close connection in his brain(both men do have the exact same title) made the slipup more likely than other possible ones. &quot;Vice President Trump‚Äù in reference to Kamala on the other hand is less so. There the connection was less close-he was talking about how he picked her because he believed she could beat Trump. Again we‚Äôre hardly at levels of ‚Äúmistaking the guy next to me for Abe Lincoln‚Äù or whatever but it‚Äôs getting worse and it will not get better unless a revolutionary new medicine or treatment(and by ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù I mean on the scale of penicillin for antibiotics or insulin for diabetes) for age-related mental health issues is made available to the public in the next year or less. Which is simply not going to happen.,2024-07-12 06:57:50 GMT

0,Joe Biden,['blacklivesmatter'  'blackvotersmatters'  'donald trump'  'naacp'  'blackmediamatters'  'blackvotersmatter'  'news'  'ados'  'youtube'],rauthschild,When we were going to school we had two textbooks one called ‚ÄúAmerican History‚Äù and one called ‚ÄúUnited States History‚Äù. These are two separate entities and two separate histories.   The American Government is a ‚Äúrepublican form of government‚Äù from its roots at the county level to its top offices and institutions.   It is not now and never has been a democracy.   There is a profound difference between our unincorporated Federation of States doing business as The United States of America and a British Crown Corporation merely calling itself ‚Äúthe United States of America Incorporated‚Äù.   It is the same gulf that stands between a woman named Monique Pressley and a British Crown Corporation calling itself MONIQUE PRESSLEY.   Our unincorporated Union States each one composed of all the living people populating all the unincorporated Counties within their State borders created both the Federation of States (1776) and the Confederation of States (1781) as unincorporated instrumentalities.   What does that mean? Both the Federation and the Confederation were designed and intended to work for the Union States in international and global venues as ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù or ‚Äúagents‚Äù to conduct business.   The American Confederation created in 1781 was additionally awarded a Constitutional Service Contract in 1787.  This original Confederation did business as ‚Äúthe States of America‚Äù and the Constitutional Contract it was awarded was called ‚ÄúThe Constitution for the united States of America‚Äù.   This original Confederation ran the resulting Federal Republic from 1787 to 1861 when it lost the quorum of its member States-of-States organizations needed to conduct business.   As a direct result of this failure to maintain unity the Federal Republic (the American Federal Subcontractor providing government services under The Constitution for the united States of America) and its members all known as ‚ÄúState Republics‚Äù (land) or ‚ÄúRepublics of State‚Äù (sea) also lost the ability to function.   A third of our original American Government and a third of the Federal Government (the American third) were both taken out of service by the so-called Civil War and never reconstructed afterward.   What remains of the American Government are the Union States holding our National Soil Jurisdiction and our Federation of States holding our International and Global jurisdictions.   What remains of the ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù Federal Government are the British Territorial Subcontractors and the Holy Roman Empire Subcontractors and/or their Successors.   Think of it as a six-celled combustion engine running on four cylinders.   The American Government is still fully functional despite these injuries; we retain concurrent and superior general jurisdiction over the actual physical Counties and States and maintain their mutual powers internationally and globally via our Federation of States.   The ‚ÄúUS‚Äù Government continues to unravel in a heap of European intrigue criminality and deceit having pulled off a huge scam amounting to a national-level identity theft and impersonation scheme against their American Employers and the American Government.   The incorporated ‚ÄúUnited States Government‚Äù entities are functionally bankrupt and only being limped along by colluding banks that are continuing to bar us from access to our own assets and pretending that these white collar criminals are our representatives and custodians.   Any such presumption is unsupported.   Lately Mr. Trump and his followers all acting knowingly or unknowingly as British Territorial Officers and Crew members of a British Crown Corporation calling itself ‚Äúthe United States of America Inc.‚Äù have proposed that they will either: (1) invade and inhabit our still unreconstructed American Federal Republic or (2) substitute a British Territorial knock-off perhaps a corporate franchise calling itself ‚Äúthe Federal Republic Incorporated‚Äù for our Federal Republic.   We return the favor and counterclaim that they return to their base in the District of Columbia do their jobs according to their contract and cease and desist all efforts to misrepresent us or defraud us further.   These British Territorial Mercenaries are already functioning under the deceptive name of ‚Äúthe American Government Inc.‚Äù which we don‚Äôt appreciate and which we want everyone to be aware of.   These matters and issues must be faced and resolved. We have seen enough British Territorial ‚Äúmischief‚Äù ‚Äî crime and abuse bad faith false claims and war-mongering ‚Äî to last several centuries.   We are calling upon the rest of the world indeed on everyone reading these words to take immediate action to stop the British Nazis behind this attempt to steal our national identity impersonate us and lead this entire planet into another grisly war-for-profit.   This morning a friend sent me a quote from Germany in 1932 ‚Äî Adolph Hitler another charismatic political leader acting as Pied Piper saying quote:   ‚ÄúThe nation is threatened from within and without. This is not a time for half-measures. It is time to make ourselves great again. And on that day heads will roll in the dust. ‚Äì Adolf Hitler 1932‚Äù  Where have we heard this ‚ÄúMake ourselves great again‚Äù slogan before? And now see the same ‚Äúset up‚Äù being applied to America? A charismatic political leader? An economic downfall precipitated by an incompetent military government? Hyper-inflation?   Fiat currency?   The set up supporting Hitler and Trump is exactly the same right down to the ‚ÄúGay Agenda‚Äù.   Hitler used gay brown shirt political capos to put him in power using promises of normalization and justice; of course he then had them deposed and murdered the moment he took power.   So now we have Joe Biden espousing the rainbow flag and promising the same things to get the sexual ‚Äúspectrum‚Äù to come out of the closet ‚Äì where Trump can identify them and blame them and lead a rampage against the imaginary target they provide.   Anything to keep public attention focused away from Trump‚Äôs own participation in and support of the Pandemic Genocide.   Bottom line Trump is a business tycoon Joe Biden is a hack and both of them are tainted ‚Äîwith no reasonable replacements standing in line and all within spitting distance of the British Territorial ‚ÄúNational‚Äù Corporate Elections.   Why are these same deceptive run-amok foreign for-profit ‚Äúgovernmental services corporations‚Äù still assuming that they have any authority or part to play in determining the future of our world or our country?   They don‚Äôt. Apart from us and apart from following our instructions and earning their pay ‚Äì in gold or silver ‚Äì they don‚Äôt have a pot.   They are exposed caught denuded red-handed paws in the cookie jar up to their shoulder joints and they still think they can brazen it out and not only fool the Autochthonous American Nationals but the rest of the world as well?   This ‚Äúshow‚Äù is not only over for the Communist Union leaders and their Municipal Empire and the municipal corporations that have been used as storefronts for that cabal; the ‚Äúshow‚Äù is over for the British Territorial Empire and their corporations too. No more substitution frauds.   We have claimed their corporate debt as our credit; delegalized their remedies for lack of performance; updated our Sovereign Patents in all three major jurisdictions as of 2015; reclaimed our assets and birthright status; served Due Process; issued our Judgement; cured everything; and rolled it all into private and public trusts subject to one Irrevocable Will that is firmly recorded and distributed world wide.   That Will is entirely in favor of the living people not the corporations. Everyone gets their purloined stuff back. The guilty corporations are either liquidated permanently or forfeited and placed under new management. The criminals go to jail. The honorable members of the military and various units of government are granted amnesty.  Te Deum. That and our completely new clean and uncomplicated banking system is really all that is needed to restore sanity and to birth a new era of peace and plenty for everyone.   Everyone who wants to know more also gets a free education about actual Law and History and Science ‚Äî not the twisted politicized suppressed and dumbed-down pablum that has been the stock and trade of our schools and universities for over a century.,2024-07-12 05:38:08 GMT

Biden offered extensive remarks on thorny foreign policy issues including competition with China and the Israel-Hamas war in which he said he had warned Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu away from an occupation of the Gaza Strip.   He said he was directly in contact with Xi Jinping to warn him not to offer further support for Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine but not with Vladimir Putin whom he said: ‚ÄúI have no reason to speak to him right now.‚Äù  But Biden who is running to be president until January 2029 fielded an equal number of questions during the press conference on his mental fitness an issue that has loomed over his campaign since a faltering debate performance against Donald Trump that he called ‚Äúthat dumb mistake‚Äù.   Ultimately it was a performance that supporters will probably say shows he is capable of handling his responsibilities as commander-in-chief but unlikely to convince those already in doubt about his mental fitness that he can serve another four years in office.   Biden 81 insisted he would stay in the race despite calls from some in his party to drop out and to allow another figure including Harris run in the November election.  ‚Ä¶ Biden said he wouldn‚Äôt leave the race unless polls showed him that he had no chance of winning against Trump even if they showed that Harris‚Äôs chances in the election were better than his own.   Nonetheless he said Harris was qualified to be president as well although he misnamed her in the endorsement. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have picked vice-president Trump to be vice-president if she‚Äôs not qualified to be president‚Äù he said.   That gaffe was compounded by the fact that he had introduced the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù just hours earlier before correcting himself and saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to beat Putin.‚Äù   Biden initially used the final Nato summit press conference as something of a stump speech brandishing his national security record in supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression and saying that the November vote was ‚Äúmuch more than a political question ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a national security issue.‚Äù  He then turned to his record on the economy border security and his efforts to broker a peace in the Israel-Hamas war to bolster his case for his campaign in November.   Biden spoke for 58 minutes including 50 minutes of unscripted question-and-answer. He appeared most comfortable and cogent as he discussed thorny foreign policy questions.     Joe Biden gave an alright presser in which he made a gaffe in which he mixed up the names of his VP and principal challenger when he said ‚ÄúVice President Trump.‚Äù Prior to the presser Biden mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù before correcting himself.

If he had actual full-on dementia he could not possibly be doing what he‚Äôs currently doing. It‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs being stretched to his limits right now but full-scale dementia would have already seen those limits completely broken; he‚Äôd be seeing the aides next to him as family members or forgetting where he is and it would either take a noticeable amount of time to clear the fog from his mind or it would just straight-up not be possible to do that.   But I‚Äôve seen dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs in action with my grandfather. And do you know how it started? It started with slipups that he was aware of. He would forget things but he knew he was forgetting them which made it easier to talk and work with him but also made it way sadder since he knew he was slipping and wasn‚Äôt going to get any better(and because he‚Äôd try to downplay it whenever possible so we wouldn‚Äôt worry because God bless him his kids and grandkids were his primary concern right up till the end). And my personal tragedies aside that‚Äôs kind of what it looks like with Biden now. He‚Äôs cognizant enough to realize when he‚Äôs made a mistake by introducing Zelenskyy as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù(he caught himself and the very next thing he said was an acknowledgement something like ‚ÄúPresident Putin? You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs gonna beat President Putin!) but not cognizant enough to stop that mistake from being made. And there‚Äôs an argument to be made that the close connection in his brain(both men do have the exact same title) made the slipup more likely than other possible ones. &quot;Vice President Trump‚Äù in reference to Kamala on the other hand is less so. There the connection was less close-he was talking about how he picked her because he believed she could beat Trump. Again we‚Äôre hardly at levels of ‚Äúmistaking the guy next to me for Abe Lincoln‚Äù or whatever but it‚Äôs getting worse and it will not get better unless a revolutionary new medicine or treatment(and by ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù I mean on the scale of penicillin for antibiotics or insulin for diabetes) for age-related mental health issues is made available to the public in the next year or less. Which is simply not going to happen.,2024-07-12 06:57:50 GMT

0,Joe Biden,['blacklivesmatter'  'blackvotersmatters'  'donald trump'  'naacp'  'blackmediamatters'  'blackvotersmatter'  'news'  'ados'  'youtube'],rauthschild,When we were going to school we had two textbooks one called ‚ÄúAmerican History‚Äù and one called ‚ÄúUnited States History‚Äù. These are two separate entities and two separate histories.   The American Government is a ‚Äúrepublican form of government‚Äù from its roots at the county level to its top offices and institutions.   It is not now and never has been a democracy.   There is a profound difference between our unincorporated Federation of States doing business as The United States of America and a British Crown Corporation merely calling itself ‚Äúthe United States of America Incorporated‚Äù.   It is the same gulf that stands between a woman named Monique Pressley and a British Crown Corporation calling itself MONIQUE PRESSLEY.   Our unincorporated Union States each one composed of all the living people populating all the unincorporated Counties within their State borders created both the Federation of States (1776) and the Confederation of States (1781) as unincorporated instrumentalities.   What does that mean? Both the Federation and the Confederation were designed and intended to work for the Union States in international and global venues as ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù or ‚Äúagents‚Äù to conduct business.   The American Confederation created in 1781 was additionally awarded a Constitutional Service Contract in 1787.  This original Confederation did business as ‚Äúthe States of America‚Äù and the Constitutional Contract it was awarded was called ‚ÄúThe Constitution for the united States of America‚Äù.   This original Confederation ran the resulting Federal Republic from 1787 to 1861 when it lost the quorum of its member States-of-States organizations needed to conduct business.   As a direct result of this failure to maintain unity the Federal Republic (the American Federal Subcontractor providing government services under The Constitution for the united States of America) and its members all known as ‚ÄúState Republics‚Äù (land) or ‚ÄúRepublics of State‚Äù (sea) also lost the ability to function.   A third of our original American Government and a third of the Federal Government (the American third) were both taken out of service by the so-called Civil War and never reconstructed afterward.   What remains of the American Government are the Union States holding our National Soil Jurisdiction and our Federation of States holding our International and Global jurisdictions.   What remains of the ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù Federal Government are the British Territorial Subcontractors and the Holy Roman Empire Subcontractors and/or their Successors.   Think of it as a six-celled combustion engine running on four cylinders.   The American Government is still fully functional despite these injuries; we retain concurrent and superior general jurisdiction over the actual physical Counties and States and maintain their mutual powers internationally and globally via our Federation of States.   The ‚ÄúUS‚Äù Government continues to unravel in a heap of European intrigue criminality and deceit having pulled off a huge scam amounting to a national-level identity theft and impersonation scheme against their American Employers and the American Government.   The incorporated ‚ÄúUnited States Government‚Äù entities are functionally bankrupt and only being limped along by colluding banks that are continuing to bar us from access to our own assets and pretending that these white collar criminals are our representatives and custodians.   Any such presumption is unsupported.   Lately Mr. Trump and his followers all acting knowingly or unknowingly as British Territorial Officers and Crew members of a British Crown Corporation calling itself ‚Äúthe United States of America Inc.‚Äù have proposed that they will either: (1) invade and inhabit our still unreconstructed American Federal Republic or (2) substitute a British Territorial knock-off perhaps a corporate franchise calling itself ‚Äúthe Federal Republic Incorporated‚Äù for our Federal Republic.   We return the favor and counterclaim that they return to their base in the District of Columbia do their jobs according to their contract and cease and desist all efforts to misrepresent us or defraud us further.   These British Territorial Mercenaries are already functioning under the deceptive name of ‚Äúthe American Government Inc.‚Äù which we don‚Äôt appreciate and which we want everyone to be aware of.   These matters and issues must be faced and resolved. We have seen enough British Territorial ‚Äúmischief‚Äù ‚Äî crime and abuse bad faith false claims and war-mongering ‚Äî to last several centuries.   We are calling upon the rest of the world indeed on everyone reading these words to take immediate action to stop the British Nazis behind this attempt to steal our national identity impersonate us and lead this entire planet into another grisly war-for-profit.   This morning a friend sent me a quote from Germany in 1932 ‚Äî Adolph Hitler another charismatic political leader acting as Pied Piper saying quote:   ‚ÄúThe nation is threatened from within and without. This is not a time for half-measures. It is time to make ourselves great again. And on that day heads will roll in the dust. ‚Äì Adolf Hitler 1932‚Äù  Where have we heard this ‚ÄúMake ourselves great again‚Äù slogan before? And now see the same ‚Äúset up‚Äù being applied to America? A charismatic political leader? An economic downfall precipitated by an incompetent military government? Hyper-inflation?   Fiat currency?   The set up supporting Hitler and Trump is exactly the same right down to the ‚ÄúGay Agenda‚Äù.   Hitler used gay brown shirt political capos to put him in power using promises of normalization and justice; of course he then had them deposed and murdered the moment he took power.   So now we have Joe Biden espousing the rainbow flag and promising the same things to get the sexual ‚Äúspectrum‚Äù to come out of the closet ‚Äì where Trump can identify them and blame them and lead a rampage against the imaginary target they provide.   Anything to keep public attention focused away from Trump‚Äôs own participation in and support of the Pandemic Genocide.   Bottom line Trump is a business tycoon Joe Biden is a hack and both of them are tainted ‚Äîwith no reasonable replacements standing in line and all within spitting distance of the British Territorial ‚ÄúNational‚Äù Corporate Elections.   Why are these same deceptive run-amok foreign for-profit ‚Äúgovernmental services corporations‚Äù still assuming that they have any authority or part to play in determining the future of our world or our country?   They don‚Äôt. Apart from us and apart from following our instructions and earning their pay ‚Äì in gold or silver ‚Äì they don‚Äôt have a pot.   They are exposed caught denuded red-handed paws in the cookie jar up to their shoulder joints and they still think they can brazen it out and not only fool the Autochthonous American Nationals but the rest of the world as well?   This ‚Äúshow‚Äù is not only over for the Communist Union leaders and their Municipal Empire and the municipal corporations that have been used as storefronts for that cabal; the ‚Äúshow‚Äù is over for the British Territorial Empire and their corporations too. No more substitution frauds.   We have claimed their corporate debt as our credit; delegalized their remedies for lack of performance; updated our Sovereign Patents in all three major jurisdictions as of 2015; reclaimed our assets and birthright status; served Due Process; issued our Judgement; cured everything; and rolled it all into private and public trusts subject to one Irrevocable Will that is firmly recorded and distributed world wide.   That Will is entirely in favor of the living people not the corporations. Everyone gets their purloined stuff back. The guilty corporations are either liquidated permanently or forfeited and placed under new management. The criminals go to jail. The honorable members of the military and various units of government are granted amnesty.  Te Deum. That and our completely new clean and uncomplicated banking system is really all that is needed to restore sanity and to birth a new era of peace and plenty for everyone.   Everyone who wants to know more also gets a free education about actual Law and History and Science ‚Äî not the twisted politicized suppressed and dumbed-down pablum that has been the stock and trade of our schools and universities for over a century.,2024-07-12 05:38:08 GMT

8,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'the new york times'  'los angeles times'  'editorials'  '2024 presidential election'  '2024 elections'],justinspoliticalcorner,Both the New York Times and LA Times released editorials correctly labeling Donald Trump unfit to lead New York Times editorial (07.11.2024): Next week for the third time in eight years Donald Trump will be nominated as the Republican Party‚Äôs candidate for president of the United States. A once great political party now serves the interests of one man a man as demonstrably unsuited for the office of president as any to run in the long history of the Republic a man whose values temperament ideas and language are directly opposed to so much of what has made this country great.   It is a chilling choice against this national moment. For more than two decades large majorities of Americans have said they are dissatisfied with the direction of the country and the post-Covid era of stubborn inflation high interest rates social division and political stagnation has left many voters even more frustrated and despondent.  The Republican Party once pursued electoral power in service to solutions for such problems to building ‚Äúthe shining city on a hill‚Äù as Ronald Reagan liked to say. Its vision of the United States ‚Äî embodied in principled public servants like George H.W. Bush John McCain and Mitt Romney ‚Äî was rooted in the values of freedom sacrifice individual responsibility and the common good. The party‚Äôs conception of those values was reflected in its longstanding conservative policy agenda and today many Republicans set aside their concerns about Mr. Trump because of his positions on immigration trade and taxes. But the stakes of this election are not fundamentally about policy disagreements. The stakes are more foundational: what qualities matter most in America‚Äôs president and commander in chief.  Mr. Trump has shown a character unworthy of the responsibilities of the presidency. He has demonstrated an utter lack of respect for the Constitution the rule of law and the American people. Instead of a cogent vision for the country‚Äôs future Mr. Trump is animated by a thirst for political power: to use the levers of government to advance his interests satisfy his impulses and exact retribution against those who he thinks have wronged him.   He is quite simply unfit to lead.  The Democrats are rightly engaged in their own debate about whether President Biden is the right person to carry the party‚Äôs nomination into the election given widespread concerns among voters about his age-related fitness. This debate is so intense because of legitimate concerns that Mr. Trump may present a danger to the country its strength security and national character ‚Äî and that a compelling Democratic alternative is the only thing that would prevent his return to power. It is a national tragedy that the Republicans have failed to have a similar debate about the manifest moral and temperamental unfitness of their standard-bearer instead setting aside their longstanding values closing ranks and choosing to overlook what those who worked most closely with the former president have described as his systematic dishonesty corruption cruelty and incompetence.   That task now falls to the American people. We urge voters to see the dangers of a second Trump term clearly and to reject it. The stakes and significance of the presidency demand a person who has essential qualities and values to earn our trust and on each one Donald Trump fails.     Los Angeles Times editorial (07.11.2024): Democrats are in crisis at the moment divided over whether President Biden should stay in the race after his disastrous debate last month or clear the way for another younger candidate.   Biden‚Äôs shaky performance raised concerns about whether he can win in November and prompted calls from prominent Democrats columnists and others for him to step aside. It‚Äôs up to the Democratic Party to sort this out. But it‚Äôs time to refocus attention on the only candidate in the race who is patently unfit for office ‚Äî any office ‚Äî and an imminent threat to democracy: Donald Trump.   It‚Äôs unbelievable that the nation is spending so much time on the question of Biden‚Äôs verbal acuity when the greatest concern ought to be that his challenger is a self-aggrandizing felon and twice-impeached election-denier. Trump fomented the Jan. 6 insurrection shows contempt for the rule of law and shamelessly lies in pursuit of more power. He‚Äôs an authoritarian who admires murderous despots wants to jail his political enemies and has publicly flirted with declaring himself a dictator on his first day back in office.  ‚Ä¶   Trump is the only man in the presidential race manifestly unworthy of holding a position of power and has no business ever returning to the White House. If the GOP had any decency left its members would be discussing whether to dump Trump for a candidate who isn‚Äôt out to bulldoze democratic institutions in favor of autocracy.   Voters should resist viewing this contest through the politics-as-usual lens of past elections. This November is not about dueling personalities middle-of-the-road policy differences or as some might see it an 81-year-old man being the lesser of two evils compared with a 78-year-old man. It‚Äôs nothing short of a referendum on our 248-year democracy and a choice between a trustworthy public servant who upholds American values and a serial liar who wants to push the country into authoritarianism.        Both the New York Times and the LA Times have released editorials rightly declaring the cognitively-challenged insurrection-inciting 34x convicted felon Donald Trump unfit to lead the nation for a 2nd term.

Biden offered extensive remarks on thorny foreign policy issues including competition with China and the Israel-Hamas war in which he said he had warned Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu away from an occupation of the Gaza Strip.   He said he was directly in contact with Xi Jinping to warn him not to offer further support for Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine but not with Vladimir Putin whom he said: ‚ÄúI have no reason to speak to him right now.‚Äù  But Biden who is running to be president until January 2029 fielded an equal number of questions during the press conference on his mental fitness an issue that has loomed over his campaign since a faltering debate performance against Donald Trump that he called ‚Äúthat dumb mistake‚Äù.   Ultimately it was a performance that supporters will probably say shows he is capable of handling his responsibilities as commander-in-chief but unlikely to convince those already in doubt about his mental fitness that he can serve another four years in office.   Biden 81 insisted he would stay in the race despite calls from some in his party to drop out and to allow another figure including Harris run in the November election.  ‚Ä¶ Biden said he wouldn‚Äôt leave the race unless polls showed him that he had no chance of winning against Trump even if they showed that Harris‚Äôs chances in the election were better than his own.   Nonetheless he said Harris was qualified to be president as well although he misnamed her in the endorsement. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have picked vice-president Trump to be vice-president if she‚Äôs not qualified to be president‚Äù he said.   That gaffe was compounded by the fact that he had introduced the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù just hours earlier before correcting himself and saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to beat Putin.‚Äù   Biden initially used the final Nato summit press conference as something of a stump speech brandishing his national security record in supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression and saying that the November vote was ‚Äúmuch more than a political question ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a national security issue.‚Äù  He then turned to his record on the economy border security and his efforts to broker a peace in the Israel-Hamas war to bolster his case for his campaign in November.   Biden spoke for 58 minutes including 50 minutes of unscripted question-and-answer. He appeared most comfortable and cogent as he discussed thorny foreign policy questions.

If he had actual full-on dementia he could not possibly be doing what he‚Äôs currently doing. It‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs being stretched to his limits right now but full-scale dementia would have already seen those limits completely broken; he‚Äôd be seeing the aides next to him as family members or forgetting where he is and it would either take a noticeable amount of time to clear the fog from his mind or it would just straight-up not be possible to do that.   But I‚Äôve seen dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs in action with my grandfather. And do you know how it started? It started with slipups that he was aware of. He would forget things but he knew he was forgetting them which made it easier to talk and work with him but also made it way sadder since he knew he was slipping and wasn‚Äôt going to get any better(and because he‚Äôd try to downplay it whenever possible so we wouldn‚Äôt worry because God bless him his kids and grandkids were his primary concern right up till the end). And my personal tragedies aside that‚Äôs kind of what it looks like with Biden now. He‚Äôs cognizant enough to realize when he‚Äôs made a mistake by introducing Zelenskyy as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù(he caught himself and the very next thing he said was an acknowledgement something like ‚ÄúPresident Putin? You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs gonna beat President Putin!) but not cognizant enough to stop that mistake from being made. And there‚Äôs an argument to be made that the close connection in his brain(both men do have the exact same title) made the slipup more likely than other possible ones. &quot;Vice President Trump‚Äù in reference to Kamala on the other hand is less so. There the connection was less close-he was talking about how he picked her because he believed she could beat Trump. Again we‚Äôre hardly at levels of ‚Äúmistaking the guy next to me for Abe Lincoln‚Äù or whatever but it‚Äôs getting worse and it will not get better unless a revolutionary new medicine or treatment(and by ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù I mean on the scale of penicillin for antibiotics or insulin for diabetes) for age-related mental health issues is made available to the public in the next year or less. Which is simply not going to happen.,2024-07-12 06:57:50 GMT

0,Joe Biden,['blacklivesmatter'  'blackvotersmatters'  'donald trump'  'naacp'  'blackmediamatters'  'blackvotersmatter'  'news'  'ados'  'youtube'],rauthschild,When we were going to school we had two textbooks one called ‚ÄúAmerican History‚Äù and one called ‚ÄúUnited States History‚Äù. These are two separate entities and two separate histories.   The American Government is a ‚Äúrepublican form of government‚Äù from its roots at the county level to its top offices and institutions.   It is not now and never has been a democracy.   There is a profound difference between our unincorporated Federation of States doing business as The United States of America and a British Crown Corporation merely calling itself ‚Äúthe United States of America Incorporated‚Äù.   It is the same gulf that stands between a woman named Monique Pressley and a British Crown Corporation calling itself MONIQUE PRESSLEY.   Our unincorporated Union States each one composed of all the living people populating all the unincorporated Counties within their State borders created both the Federation of States (1776) and the Confederation of States (1781) as unincorporated instrumentalities.   What does that mean? Both the Federation and the Confederation were designed and intended to work for the Union States in international and global venues as ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù or ‚Äúagents‚Äù to conduct business.   The American Confederation created in 1781 was additionally awarded a Constitutional Service Contract in 1787.  This original Confederation did business as ‚Äúthe States of America‚Äù and the Constitutional Contract it was awarded was called ‚ÄúThe Constitution for the united States of America‚Äù.   This original Confederation ran the resulting Federal Republic from 1787 to 1861 when it lost the quorum of its member States-of-States organizations needed to conduct business.   As a direct result of this failure to maintain unity the Federal Republic (the American Federal Subcontractor providing government services under The Constitution for the united States of America) and its members all known as ‚ÄúState Republics‚Äù (land) or ‚ÄúRepublics of State‚Äù (sea) also lost the ability to function.   A third of our original American Government and a third of the Federal Government (the American third) were both taken out of service by the so-called Civil War and never reconstructed afterward.   What remains of the American Government are the Union States holding our National Soil Jurisdiction and our Federation of States holding our International and Global jurisdictions.   What remains of the ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù Federal Government are the British Territorial Subcontractors and the Holy Roman Empire Subcontractors and/or their Successors.   Think of it as a six-celled combustion engine running on four cylinders.   The American Government is still fully functional despite these injuries; we retain concurrent and superior general jurisdiction over the actual physical Counties and States and maintain their mutual powers internationally and globally via our Federation of States.   The ‚ÄúUS‚Äù Government continues to unravel in a heap of European intrigue criminality and deceit having pulled off a huge scam amounting to a national-level identity theft and impersonation scheme against their American Employers and the American Government.   The incorporated ‚ÄúUnited States Government‚Äù entities are functionally bankrupt and only being limped along by colluding banks that are continuing to bar us from access to our own assets and pretending that these white collar criminals are our representatives and custodians.   Any such presumption is unsupported.   Lately Mr. Trump and his followers all acting knowingly or unknowingly as British Territorial Officers and Crew members of a British Crown Corporation calling itself ‚Äúthe United States of America Inc.‚Äù have proposed that they will either: (1) invade and inhabit our still unreconstructed American Federal Republic or (2) substitute a British Territorial knock-off perhaps a corporate franchise calling itself ‚Äúthe Federal Republic Incorporated‚Äù for our Federal Republic.   We return the favor and counterclaim that they return to their base in the District of Columbia do their jobs according to their contract and cease and desist all efforts to misrepresent us or defraud us further.   These British Territorial Mercenaries are already functioning under the deceptive name of ‚Äúthe American Government Inc.‚Äù which we don‚Äôt appreciate and which we want everyone to be aware of.   These matters and issues must be faced and resolved. We have seen enough British Territorial ‚Äúmischief‚Äù ‚Äî crime and abuse bad faith false claims and war-mongering ‚Äî to last several centuries.   We are calling upon the rest of the world indeed on everyone reading these words to take immediate action to stop the British Nazis behind this attempt to steal our national identity impersonate us and lead this entire planet into another grisly war-for-profit.   This morning a friend sent me a quote from Germany in 1932 ‚Äî Adolph Hitler another charismatic political leader acting as Pied Piper saying quote:   ‚ÄúThe nation is threatened from within and without. This is not a time for half-measures. It is time to make ourselves great again. And on that day heads will roll in the dust. ‚Äì Adolf Hitler 1932‚Äù  Where have we heard this ‚ÄúMake ourselves great again‚Äù slogan before? And now see the same ‚Äúset up‚Äù being applied to America? A charismatic political leader? An economic downfall precipitated by an incompetent military government? Hyper-inflation?   Fiat currency?   The set up supporting Hitler and Trump is exactly the same right down to the ‚ÄúGay Agenda‚Äù.   Hitler used gay brown shirt political capos to put him in power using promises of normalization and justice; of course he then had them deposed and murdered the moment he took power.   So now we have Joe Biden espousing the rainbow flag and promising the same things to get the sexual ‚Äúspectrum‚Äù to come out of the closet ‚Äì where Trump can identify them and blame them and lead a rampage against the imaginary target they provide.   Anything to keep public attention focused away from Trump‚Äôs own participation in and support of the Pandemic Genocide.   Bottom line Trump is a business tycoon Joe Biden is a hack and both of them are tainted ‚Äîwith no reasonable replacements standing in line and all within spitting distance of the British Territorial ‚ÄúNational‚Äù Corporate Elections.   Why are these same deceptive run-amok foreign for-profit ‚Äúgovernmental services corporations‚Äù still assuming that they have any authority or part to play in determining the future of our world or our country?   They don‚Äôt. Apart from us and apart from following our instructions and earning their pay ‚Äì in gold or silver ‚Äì they don‚Äôt have a pot.   They are exposed caught denuded red-handed paws in the cookie jar up to their shoulder joints and they still think they can brazen it out and not only fool the Autochthonous American Nationals but the rest of the world as well?   This ‚Äúshow‚Äù is not only over for the Communist Union leaders and their Municipal Empire and the municipal corporations that have been used as storefronts for that cabal; the ‚Äúshow‚Äù is over for the British Territorial Empire and their corporations too. No more substitution frauds.   We have claimed their corporate debt as our credit; delegalized their remedies for lack of performance; updated our Sovereign Patents in all three major jurisdictions as of 2015; reclaimed our assets and birthright status; served Due Process; issued our Judgement; cured everything; and rolled it all into private and public trusts subject to one Irrevocable Will that is firmly recorded and distributed world wide.   That Will is entirely in favor of the living people not the corporations. Everyone gets their purloined stuff back. The guilty corporations are either liquidated permanently or forfeited and placed under new management. The criminals go to jail. The honorable members of the military and various units of government are granted amnesty.  Te Deum. That and our completely new clean and uncomplicated banking system is really all that is needed to restore sanity and to birth a new era of peace and plenty for everyone.   Everyone who wants to know more also gets a free education about actual Law and History and Science ‚Äî not the twisted politicized suppressed and dumbed-down pablum that has been the stock and trade of our schools and universities for over a century.,2024-07-12 05:38:08 GMT

8,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'the new york times'  'los angeles times'  'editorials'  '2024 presidential election'  '2024 elections'],justinspoliticalcorner,Both the New York Times and LA Times released editorials correctly labeling Donald Trump unfit to lead New York Times editorial (07.11.2024): Next week for the third time in eight years Donald Trump will be nominated as the Republican Party‚Äôs candidate for president of the United States. A once great political party now serves the interests of one man a man as demonstrably unsuited for the office of president as any to run in the long history of the Republic a man whose values temperament ideas and language are directly opposed to so much of what has made this country great.   It is a chilling choice against this national moment. For more than two decades large majorities of Americans have said they are dissatisfied with the direction of the country and the post-Covid era of stubborn inflation high interest rates social division and political stagnation has left many voters even more frustrated and despondent.  The Republican Party once pursued electoral power in service to solutions for such problems to building ‚Äúthe shining city on a hill‚Äù as Ronald Reagan liked to say. Its vision of the United States ‚Äî embodied in principled public servants like George H.W. Bush John McCain and Mitt Romney ‚Äî was rooted in the values of freedom sacrifice individual responsibility and the common good. The party‚Äôs conception of those values was reflected in its longstanding conservative policy agenda and today many Republicans set aside their concerns about Mr. Trump because of his positions on immigration trade and taxes. But the stakes of this election are not fundamentally about policy disagreements. The stakes are more foundational: what qualities matter most in America‚Äôs president and commander in chief.  Mr. Trump has shown a character unworthy of the responsibilities of the presidency. He has demonstrated an utter lack of respect for the Constitution the rule of law and the American people. Instead of a cogent vision for the country‚Äôs future Mr. Trump is animated by a thirst for political power: to use the levers of government to advance his interests satisfy his impulses and exact retribution against those who he thinks have wronged him.   He is quite simply unfit to lead.  The Democrats are rightly engaged in their own debate about whether President Biden is the right person to carry the party‚Äôs nomination into the election given widespread concerns among voters about his age-related fitness. This debate is so intense because of legitimate concerns that Mr. Trump may present a danger to the country its strength security and national character ‚Äî and that a compelling Democratic alternative is the only thing that would prevent his return to power. It is a national tragedy that the Republicans have failed to have a similar debate about the manifest moral and temperamental unfitness of their standard-bearer instead setting aside their longstanding values closing ranks and choosing to overlook what those who worked most closely with the former president have described as his systematic dishonesty corruption cruelty and incompetence.   That task now falls to the American people. We urge voters to see the dangers of a second Trump term clearly and to reject it. The stakes and significance of the presidency demand a person who has essential qualities and values to earn our trust and on each one Donald Trump fails.     Los Angeles Times editorial (07.11.2024): Democrats are in crisis at the moment divided over whether President Biden should stay in the race after his disastrous debate last month or clear the way for another younger candidate.   Biden‚Äôs shaky performance raised concerns about whether he can win in November and prompted calls from prominent Democrats columnists and others for him to step aside. It‚Äôs up to the Democratic Party to sort this out. But it‚Äôs time to refocus attention on the only candidate in the race who is patently unfit for office ‚Äî any office ‚Äî and an imminent threat to democracy: Donald Trump.   It‚Äôs unbelievable that the nation is spending so much time on the question of Biden‚Äôs verbal acuity when the greatest concern ought to be that his challenger is a self-aggrandizing felon and twice-impeached election-denier. Trump fomented the Jan. 6 insurrection shows contempt for the rule of law and shamelessly lies in pursuit of more power. He‚Äôs an authoritarian who admires murderous despots wants to jail his political enemies and has publicly flirted with declaring himself a dictator on his first day back in office.  ‚Ä¶   Trump is the only man in the presidential race manifestly unworthy of holding a position of power and has no business ever returning to the White House. If the GOP had any decency left its members would be discussing whether to dump Trump for a candidate who isn‚Äôt out to bulldoze democratic institutions in favor of autocracy.   Voters should resist viewing this contest through the politics-as-usual lens of past elections. This November is not about dueling personalities middle-of-the-road policy differences or as some might see it an 81-year-old man being the lesser of two evils compared with a 78-year-old man. It‚Äôs nothing short of a referendum on our 248-year democracy and a choice between a trustworthy public servant who upholds American values and a serial liar who wants to push the country into authoritarianism.        Both the New York Times and the LA Times have released editorials rightly declaring the cognitively-challenged insurrection-inciting 34x convicted felon Donald Trump unfit to lead the nation for a 2nd term.

Biden offered extensive remarks on thorny foreign policy issues including competition with China and the Israel-Hamas war in which he said he had warned Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu away from an occupation of the Gaza Strip.   He said he was directly in contact with Xi Jinping to warn him not to offer further support for Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine but not with Vladimir Putin whom he said: ‚ÄúI have no reason to speak to him right now.‚Äù  But Biden who is running to be president until January 2029 fielded an equal number of questions during the press conference on his mental fitness an issue that has loomed over his campaign since a faltering debate performance against Donald Trump that he called ‚Äúthat dumb mistake‚Äù.   Ultimately it was a performance that supporters will probably say shows he is capable of handling his responsibilities as commander-in-chief but unlikely to convince those already in doubt about his mental fitness that he can serve another four years in office.   Biden 81 insisted he would stay in the race despite calls from some in his party to drop out and to allow another figure including Harris run in the November election.  ‚Ä¶ Biden said he wouldn‚Äôt leave the race unless polls showed him that he had no chance of winning against Trump even if they showed that Harris‚Äôs chances in the election were better than his own.   Nonetheless he said Harris was qualified to be president as well although he misnamed her in the endorsement. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have picked vice-president Trump to be vice-president if she‚Äôs not qualified to be president‚Äù he said.   That gaffe was compounded by the fact that he had introduced the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù just hours earlier before correcting himself and saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to beat Putin.‚Äù   Biden initially used the final Nato summit press conference as something of a stump speech brandishing his national security record in supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression and saying that the November vote was ‚Äúmuch more than a political question ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a national security issue.‚Äù  He then turned to his record on the economy border security and his efforts to broker a peace in the Israel-Hamas war to bolster his case for his campaign in November.   Biden spoke for 58 minutes including 50 minutes of unscripted question-and-answer. He appeared most comfortable and cogent as he discussed thorny foreign policy questions.     Joe Biden gave an alright presser in which he made a gaffe in which he mixed up the names of his VP and principal challenger when he said ‚ÄúVice President Trump.‚Äù Prior to the presser Biden mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù before correcting himself.

If he had actual full-on dementia he could not possibly be doing what he‚Äôs currently doing. It‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs being stretched to his limits right now but full-scale dementia would have already seen those limits completely broken; he‚Äôd be seeing the aides next to him as family members or forgetting where he is and it would either take a noticeable amount of time to clear the fog from his mind or it would just straight-up not be possible to do that.   But I‚Äôve seen dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs in action with my grandfather. And do you know how it started? It started with slipups that he was aware of. He would forget things but he knew he was forgetting them which made it easier to talk and work with him but also made it way sadder since he knew he was slipping and wasn‚Äôt going to get any better(and because he‚Äôd try to downplay it whenever possible so we wouldn‚Äôt worry because God bless him his kids and grandkids were his primary concern right up till the end). And my personal tragedies aside that‚Äôs kind of what it looks like with Biden now. He‚Äôs cognizant enough to realize when he‚Äôs made a mistake by introducing Zelenskyy as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù(he caught himself and the very next thing he said was an acknowledgement something like ‚ÄúPresident Putin?

8,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'the new york times'  'los angeles times'  'editorials'  '2024 presidential election'  '2024 elections'],justinspoliticalcorner,Both the New York Times and LA Times released editorials correctly labeling Donald Trump unfit to lead New York Times editorial (07.11.2024): Next week for the third time in eight years Donald Trump will be nominated as the Republican Party‚Äôs candidate for president of the United States. A once great political party now serves the interests of one man a man as demonstrably unsuited for the office of president as any to run in the long history of the Republic a man whose values temperament ideas and language are directly opposed to so much of what has made this country great.   It is a chilling choice against this national moment. For more than two decades large majorities of Americans have said they are dissatisfied with the direction of the country and the post-Covid era of stubborn inflation high interest rates social division and political stagnation has left many voters even more frustrated and despondent.  The Republican Party once pursued electoral power in service to solutions for such problems to building ‚Äúthe shining city on a hill‚Äù as Ronald Reagan liked to say. Its vision of the United States ‚Äî embodied in principled public servants like George H.W. Bush John McCain and Mitt Romney ‚Äî was rooted in the values of freedom sacrifice individual responsibility and the common good. The party‚Äôs conception of those values was reflected in its longstanding conservative policy agenda and today many Republicans set aside their concerns about Mr. Trump because of his positions on immigration trade and taxes. But the stakes of this election are not fundamentally about policy disagreements. The stakes are more foundational: what qualities matter most in America‚Äôs president and commander in chief.  Mr. Trump has shown a character unworthy of the responsibilities of the presidency. He has demonstrated an utter lack of respect for the Constitution the rule of law and the American people. Instead of a cogent vision for the country‚Äôs future Mr. Trump is animated by a thirst for political power: to use the levers of government to advance his interests satisfy his impulses and exact retribution against those who he thinks have wronged him.   He is quite simply unfit to lead.  The Democrats are rightly engaged in their own debate about whether President Biden is the right person to carry the party‚Äôs nomination into the election given widespread concerns among voters about his age-related fitness. This debate is so intense because of legitimate concerns that Mr. Trump may present a danger to the country its strength security and national character ‚Äî and that a compelling Democratic alternative is the only thing that would prevent his return to power. It is a national tragedy that the Republicans have failed to have a similar debate about the manifest moral and temperamental unfitness of their standard-bearer instead setting aside their longstanding values closing ranks and choosing to overlook what those who worked most closely with the former president have described as his systematic dishonesty corruption cruelty and incompetence.   That task now falls to the American people. We urge voters to see the dangers of a second Trump term clearly and to reject it. The stakes and significance of the presidency demand a person who has essential qualities and values to earn our trust and on each one Donald Trump fails.     Los Angeles Times editorial (07.11.2024): Democrats are in crisis at the moment divided over whether President Biden should stay in the race after his disastrous debate last month or clear the way for another younger candidate.   Biden‚Äôs shaky performance raised concerns about whether he can win in November and prompted calls from prominent Democrats columnists and others for him to step aside. It‚Äôs up to the Democratic Party to sort this out. But it‚Äôs time to refocus attention on the only candidate in the race who is patently unfit for office ‚Äî any office ‚Äî and an imminent threat to democracy: Donald Trump.   It‚Äôs unbelievable that the nation is spending so much time on the question of Biden‚Äôs verbal acuity when the greatest concern ought to be that his challenger is a self-aggrandizing felon and twice-impeached election-denier. Trump fomented the Jan. 6 insurrection shows contempt for the rule of law and shamelessly lies in pursuit of more power. He‚Äôs an authoritarian who admires murderous despots wants to jail his political enemies and has publicly flirted with declaring himself a dictator on his first day back in office.  ‚Ä¶   Trump is the only man in the presidential race manifestly unworthy of holding a position of power and has no business ever returning to the White House. If the GOP had any decency left its members would be discussing whether to dump Trump for a candidate who isn‚Äôt out to bulldoze democratic institutions in favor of autocracy.   Voters should resist viewing this contest through the politics-as-usual lens of past elections. This November is not about dueling personalities middle-of-the-road policy differences or as some might see it an 81-year-old man being the lesser of two evils compared with a 78-year-old man. It‚Äôs nothing short of a referendum on our 248-year democracy and a choice between a trustworthy public servant who upholds American values and a serial liar who wants to push the country into authoritarianism.        Both the New York Times and the LA Times have released editorials rightly declaring the cognitively-challenged insurrection-inciting 34x convicted felon Donald Trump unfit to lead the nation for a 2nd term.

Biden offered extensive remarks on thorny foreign policy issues including competition with China and the Israel-Hamas war in which he said he had warned Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu away from an occupation of the Gaza Strip.   He said he was directly in contact with Xi Jinping to warn him not to offer further support for Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine but not with Vladimir Putin whom he said: ‚ÄúI have no reason to speak to him right now.‚Äù  But Biden who is running to be president until January 2029 fielded an equal number of questions during the press conference on his mental fitness an issue that has loomed over his campaign since a faltering debate performance against Donald Trump that he called ‚Äúthat dumb mistake‚Äù.   Ultimately it was a performance that supporters will probably say shows he is capable of handling his responsibilities as commander-in-chief but unlikely to convince those already in doubt about his mental fitness that he can serve another four years in office.   Biden 81 insisted he would stay in the race despite calls from some in his party to drop out and to allow another figure including Harris run in the November election.  ‚Ä¶ Biden said he wouldn‚Äôt leave the race unless polls showed him that he had no chance of winning against Trump even if they showed that Harris‚Äôs chances in the election were better than his own.   Nonetheless he said Harris was qualified to be president as well although he misnamed her in the endorsement. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have picked vice-president Trump to be vice-president if she‚Äôs not qualified to be president‚Äù he said.   That gaffe was compounded by the fact that he had introduced the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù just hours earlier before correcting himself and saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to beat Putin.‚Äù   Biden initially used the final Nato summit press conference as something of a stump speech brandishing his national security record in supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression and saying that the November vote was ‚Äúmuch more than a political question ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a national security issue.‚Äù  He then turned to his record on the economy border security and his efforts to broker a peace in the Israel-Hamas war to bolster his case for his campaign in November.   Biden spoke for 58 minutes including 50 minutes of unscripted question-and-answer. He appeared most comfortable and cogent as he discussed thorny foreign policy questions.     Joe Biden gave an alright presser in which he made a gaffe in which he mixed up the names of his VP and principal challenger when he said ‚ÄúVice President Trump.‚Äù Prior to the presser Biden mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù before correcting himself.

The program focused on persons with more than $1 million in yearly income who owned more than $250000 in unpaid taxes. Thanks to money in Biden‚Äôs 2022 Inflation Reduction Act the IRS is able to undertake more enforcement against rich tax cheats after years of Republicans cutting the agency‚Äôs budget which they hope to do again if they win power again.  The Biden administration announced a $244 million dollar investment in the federal government‚Äôs registered apprenticeship program. This marks the largest investment in the program‚Äôs history with grants going out to 52 programs in 32 states. The President is focused on getting well paying blue collar opportunities to people and more people are taking part in the apprenticeship program than ever before. Republican pledge to cut it even as employers struggle to find qualified workers.  The Department of Transportation announced the largest single project in the department‚Äôs history $11 billion dollars in grants for the The Hudson River Tunnel. Part of the $66 billion the Biden Administration has invested in our rail system the tunnel the most complex Infrastructure project in the nation would link New York and New Jersey by rail under the Hudson. Once finished it‚Äôs believed it‚Äôll impact 20% of the American economy by improving and speeding connection throughout the Northeast.  The Department of Energy announced $1.7 billion to save auto worker‚Äôs jobs and convert factories to electronic vehicles. The Biden administration will used the money to save or reopen factories in Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Georgia Illinois Indiana Maryland and Virginia and retool them to make electric cars. The project will save 15000 skilled union worker jobs and created 2900 new high-quality jobs.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development reached a settlement with The Appraisal Foundation over racial discrimination. TAF is the organization responsible for setting standards and qualifications for real estate appraisers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics last year found that TAF was 94.7% White and 0.6% Black making it the least racially diverse of the 800 occupations surveyed. Black and Latino home owners are far more likely to have their houses under valued than whites. Under the settlement with HUD TAF will have to take serious steps to increase diversity and remove structural barriers to diversity.  The Department of Justice disrupted an effort by the Russian government to influence public opinion through AI bots. The DoJ shut down nearly 1000 twitter accounts that were linked to a Russian Bot farm. The bots used AI technology to not only generate tweets but also AI image faces for profile pictures. The effort seemed focused on boosting support for Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine and spread negative stories/impressions about Ukraine.  The Department of Transportation announces $1.5 billion to help local authorities buy made in America buses. 80% of the funding will go toward zero or low-emission technology a part of the President‚Äôs goal of reaching zero emissions by 2050. This is part of the $5 billion the DOT has spent over the last 3 years replacing aging buses with new cleaner technology.  President Biden with Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau and Finnish President Alexander Stubb signed a new agreement on the arctic. The new trilateral agreement between the 3 NATO partners known as the ICE Pact will boost production of ice breaking ships the 3 plan to build as many as 90 between them in the coming years. The alliance hopes to be a counter weight to China‚Äôs current dominance in the ice breaker market and help western allies respond to Russia‚Äôs aggressive push into the arctic waters.  The Department of Transportation announced $1.1 billion for greater rail safety. The program seeks to where ever possible eliminate rail crossings thus removing the dangers and inconvenience to communities divided by rail lines. It will also help update and improve safety measures at rail crossings.  The Department of the Interior announced $120 million to help tribal communities prepare for climate disasters. This funding is part of half a billion dollars the Biden administration has spent to help tribes build climate resilience which itself is part of a $50 billion dollar effort to build climate resilience across the nation. This funding will help support drought measures wildland fire mitigation community-driven relocation managed retreat protect-in-place efforts and ocean and coastal management. The USDA announced $100 million in additional funds to help feed low income kids over the summer. Known as ‚ÄúSUN Bucks‚Äù or ‚ÄúSummer EBT‚Äù the new Biden program grants the families of kids who qualify for free meals at school $120 dollars pre-child for groceries. This comes on top of the traditional SUN Meals program which offers school meals to qualifying children over the summer as well as the new under President Biden SUN Meals To-Go program which is now offering delivery of meals to low-income children in rural areas. This grant is meant to help local governments build up the Infrastructure to support and distribute SUN Bucks. If fully implemented SUN Bucks could help 30 million kids but many Republican governors have refused the funding. USAID announced its giving $100 million to the UN World Food Program to deliver urgently needed food assistance in Gaza. This will bring the total humanitarian aid given by the US to the Palestinian people since the war started in October 2023 to $774 million the single largest donor nation. President Biden at his press conference last night said that Israel and Hamas have agreed in principle to a ceasefire deal that will end the war and release the hostages. US negotiators are working to close the final gaps between the two sides and end the war.  The Senate confirmed Nancy Maldonado to serve as a Judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Maldonado is the 202nd federal Judge appointed by President Biden to be confirmed. She will the first Latino judge to ever serve on the 7th Circuit which covers Illinois Indiana and Wisconsin.  Bonus: At the NATO summit in Washington DC President Biden joined 32 allies in the Ukraine compact. Allies from Japan to Iceland confirmed their support for Ukraine and deepening their commitments to building Ukraine‚Äôs forces and keeping a free and Democratic Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. World leaders such as British Prime Minster Keir Starmer German Chancellor Olaf Scholz French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised President Biden‚Äôs experience and leadership during the NATO summit,2024-07-12 13:07:18 GMT

The program focused on persons with more than $1 million in yearly income who owned more than $250000 in unpaid taxes. Thanks to money in Biden‚Äôs 2022 Inflation Reduction Act the IRS is able to undertake more enforcement against rich tax cheats after years of Republicans cutting the agency‚Äôs budget which they hope to do again if they win power again.  The Biden administration announced a $244 million dollar investment in the federal government‚Äôs registered apprenticeship program. This marks the largest investment in the program‚Äôs history with grants going out to 52 programs in 32 states. The President is focused on getting well paying blue collar opportunities to people and more people are taking part in the apprenticeship program than ever before. Republican pledge to cut it even as employers struggle to find qualified workers.  The Department of Transportation announced the largest single project in the department‚Äôs history $11 billion dollars in grants for the The Hudson River Tunnel. Part of the $66 billion the Biden Administration has invested in our rail system the tunnel the most complex Infrastructure project in the nation would link New York and New Jersey by rail under the Hudson. Once finished it‚Äôs believed it‚Äôll impact 20% of the American economy by improving and speeding connection throughout the Northeast.  The Department of Energy announced $1.7 billion to save auto worker‚Äôs jobs and convert factories to electronic vehicles. The Biden administration will used the money to save or reopen factories in Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Georgia Illinois Indiana Maryland and Virginia and retool them to make electric cars. The project will save 15000 skilled union worker jobs and created 2900 new high-quality jobs.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development reached a settlement with The Appraisal Foundation over racial discrimination. TAF is the organization responsible for setting standards and qualifications for real estate appraisers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics last year found that TAF was 94.7% White and 0.6% Black making it the least racially diverse of the 800 occupations surveyed. Black and Latino home owners are far more likely to have their houses under valued than whites. Under the settlement with HUD TAF will have to take serious steps to increase diversity and remove structural barriers to diversity.  The Department of Justice disrupted an effort by the Russian government to influence public opinion through AI bots. The DoJ shut down nearly 1000 twitter accounts that were linked to a Russian Bot farm. The bots used AI technology to not only generate tweets but also AI image faces for profile pictures. The effort seemed focused on boosting support for Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine and spread negative stories/impressions about Ukraine.  The Department of Transportation announces $1.5 billion to help local authorities buy made in America buses. 80% of the funding will go toward zero or low-emission technology a part of the President‚Äôs goal of reaching zero emissions by 2050. This is part of the $5 billion the DOT has spent over the last 3 years replacing aging buses with new cleaner technology.  President Biden with Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau and Finnish President Alexander Stubb signed a new agreement on the arctic. The new trilateral agreement between the 3 NATO partners known as the ICE Pact will boost production of ice breaking ships the 3 plan to build as many as 90 between them in the coming years. The alliance hopes to be a counter weight to China‚Äôs current dominance in the ice breaker market and help western allies respond to Russia‚Äôs aggressive push into the arctic waters.  The Department of Transportation announced $1.1 billion for greater rail safety. The program seeks to where ever possible eliminate rail crossings thus removing the dangers and inconvenience to communities divided by rail lines. It will also help update and improve safety measures at rail crossings.  The Department of the Interior announced $120 million to help tribal communities prepare for climate disasters. This funding is part of half a billion dollars the Biden administration has spent to help tribes build climate resilience which itself is part of a $50 billion dollar effort to build climate resilience across the nation. This funding will help support drought measures wildland fire mitigation community-driven relocation managed retreat protect-in-place efforts and ocean and coastal management. The USDA announced $100 million in additional funds to help feed low income kids over the summer. Known as ‚ÄúSUN Bucks‚Äù or ‚ÄúSummer EBT‚Äù the new Biden program grants the families of kids who qualify for free meals at school $120 dollars pre-child for groceries. This comes on top of the traditional SUN Meals program which offers school meals to qualifying children over the summer as well as the new under President Biden SUN Meals To-Go program which is now offering delivery of meals to low-income children in rural areas. This grant is meant to help local governments build up the Infrastructure to support and distribute SUN Bucks. If fully implemented SUN Bucks could help 30 million kids but many Republican governors have refused the funding. USAID announced its giving $100 million to the UN World Food Program to deliver urgently needed food assistance in Gaza. This will bring the total humanitarian aid given by the US to the Palestinian people since the war started in October 2023 to $774 million the single largest donor nation. President Biden at his press conference last night said that Israel and Hamas have agreed in principle to a ceasefire deal that will end the war and release the hostages. US negotiators are working to close the final gaps between the two sides and end the war.  The Senate confirmed Nancy Maldonado to serve as a Judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Maldonado is the 202nd federal Judge appointed by President Biden to be confirmed. She will the first Latino judge to ever serve on the 7th Circuit which covers Illinois Indiana and Wisconsin.  Bonus: At the NATO summit in Washington DC President Biden joined 32 allies in the Ukraine compact. Allies from Japan to Iceland confirmed their support for Ukraine and deepening their commitments to building Ukraine‚Äôs forces and keeping a free and Democratic Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. World leaders such as British Prime Minster Keir Starmer German Chancellor Olaf Scholz French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised President Biden‚Äôs experience and leadership during the NATO summit,2024-07-12 13:07:18 GMT

Your family used it for cooking grilling smoking ribs or even to wrap your sandwiches for school and to store left overs at home because it‚Äôs so versatile.  The primary issue with aluminum foil is that it will leach aluminum into the food it‚Äôs cooked with and not just tiny amounts.  A number of studies have looked at aluminum content of foods cooked with aluminum foil aluminum cookware and aluminum utensils (even at storing food in aluminum containers) and all of the above cause aluminum to leach into your food.  Aluminum is a neurotoxic heavy metal that has been linked to health issues such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease as well as malfunction of certain parts of your brain: memory decline loss of coordination and body control.  Also it builds up in your bones and can take the place of calcium deteriorating your bone quality.  The good news is that our bodies can process some of this aluminum and get rid of it however if you have kidney issues that‚Äôs even bigger reason to avoid anything with aluminum!  The bad news is that aluminum is everywhere and we come in contact with it.   You can also find aluminum in antacids astringents buffered aspirin food additives deodorants cosmetics kitchen utensils pots pans and in many food packaging.  Niko Niko Niko what can I use instead of aluminum foil?  There are many alternatives you can use  For storing food I use glass storage containers.  For baking I use glass ceramic stainless steel and when it comes to muffin pans use unbleached parchment baking paper.  For grilling you can use the grill as is but when grilling smaller pieces of vegetables you can use grill basket cedar grilling papers.  For wrapping food you want to bake or grill (like meats potatoes etc): you can use all natural cedar wraps  Cooking with aluminum foil is highly toxic so unless you want to be like Sleepy Joe I highly advise that you stop using it.

1,Joe Biden,['democratic party'  'democratic national committee'  'donald trump'  'democracy'],ourquietman,If Democrats suppose it is safe to quietly go along with a losing campaign rather than stick their necks out for a change with an uncertain result they are not thinking dynamically enough about how their own voters would respond in the aftermath of defeat. Ezra Klein recently reported private conversations with elected Democrats who say ‚ÄúI can live with Donald Trump winning.‚Äù   The party‚Äôs organizing basis since the first day Trump took office has been to treat him as a civic emergency. This is the basis for demanding donations volunteering and sacrifice. If they are not willing to endure the relatively modest discomfort of a contentious intraparty debate to minimize the chance of a second Trump term they‚Äôll have broken faith with their supporters.   In the meantime the result of this paralysis is a crippled Biden dragging a mostly unwilling party to what it regards as certain defeat. Three and a half years ago one could have imagined Trumpian authoritarianism returning to power in a blaze of violence. Instead history may record that he took power again when his opposition essentially abdicated.  Jonathan Chait in NEW YORK,2024-07-12 21:23:31 GMT

2,Joe Biden,['original'  'anybody'  'what i think'],nodynasty4us,Who really wants Biden to drop out? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard all the uproar about Joe Biden‚Äôs bad performance at the first presidential debate and the calls for him to drop out so that the Democrats could nominate a better candidate for president.  But as more polls have been released after the debate the results don‚Äôt show anything. Biden‚Äôs standing is either unchanged or has only dropped by a statistically insignificant amount. (To be sure no news is bad news in this case ‚Äì the Biden campaign was counting on an uptick in the polls after the debate.)  Why is there a big difference between the polls and the chatter? Could it be that regular voters who are pointing to Biden‚Äôs speaking performance as a sign of senility were already planning not to vote for him anyway?  So who is responsible for all the public attention this topic is getting? I can think of several players:  Democrats in Congress who are concerned about their own re-election bids with Biden at the top of the ticket. News outlets who are happy to publish a lot of criticism of a Democrat in the hopes that this will convince conservatives that the mainstream media doesn‚Äôt have a liberal bias. (Hint: this won‚Äôt be enough.) Pundits and prominent people outside politics who are getting ready to say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù if Biden loses in November. The Trump campaign and conservative leaders in general are talking up the issue in hopes of damaging Biden‚Äôs chances. Unlike some columnists I don‚Äôt think they actually want Biden to drop out in the hopes of infighting in the Democratic Party. If they did they wouldn‚Äôt be drafting legal challenges against any potential Biden replacement. No in the same way that they talk about immigration but don‚Äôt want to actually do anything about it they talk about Biden‚Äôs age but don‚Äôt actually want him replaced.

2,Joe Biden,['original'  'anybody'  'what i think'],nodynasty4us,Who really wants Biden to drop out? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard all the uproar about Joe Biden‚Äôs bad performance at the first presidential debate and the calls for him to drop out so that the Democrats could nominate a better candidate for president.  But as more polls have been released after the debate the results don‚Äôt show anything. Biden‚Äôs standing is either unchanged or has only dropped by a statistically insignificant amount. (To be sure no news is bad news in this case ‚Äì the Biden campaign was counting on an uptick in the polls after the debate.)  Why is there a big difference between the polls and the chatter? Could it be that regular voters who are pointing to Biden‚Äôs speaking performance as a sign of senility were already planning not to vote for him anyway?  So who is responsible for all the public attention this topic is getting? I can think of several players:  Democrats in Congress who are concerned about their own re-election bids with Biden at the top of the ticket. News outlets who are happy to publish a lot of criticism of a Democrat in the hopes that this will convince conservatives that the mainstream media doesn‚Äôt have a liberal bias. (Hint: this won‚Äôt be enough.) Pundits and prominent people outside politics who are getting ready to say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù if Biden loses in November. The Trump campaign and conservative leaders in general are talking up the issue in hopes of damaging Biden‚Äôs chances. Unlike some columnists I don‚Äôt think they actually want Biden to drop out in the hopes of infighting in the Democratic Party. If they did they wouldn‚Äôt be drafting legal challenges against any potential Biden replacement. No in the same way that they talk about immigration but don‚Äôt want to actually do anything about it they talk about Biden‚Äôs age but don‚Äôt actually want him replaced. Can you think of any other reasons why someone who wasn‚Äôt already opposed to Biden might want to replace him now or at least talk about replacing him?,2024-07-13 00:30:52 GMT

Early Thursday Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert rhetorically asked online ‚ÄúI wonder what could have caused Joe Biden‚Äôs rapid physical and cognitive decline?‚Äù But her choice to include four additional photos of Biden getting vaccinations revealed the shallowness of her concern.   Boebert has aggressively pushed the idea that Covid-19 vaccines are unsafe and dangerous accusing door-to-door vaccinators at the height of the pandemic of being ‚Äúneedle Nazis‚Äù and claiming that instituting a mandatory vaccine network would be akin to ‚Äúcommunist China.‚Äù In April the Colorado congresswoman became a target for the conspiracy she helped inflame battling conspiracy theorists after she suffered a medical emergency.  Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) ghoulishly trafficked in anti-vaccine conspiracism by baselessly suggesting that President Joe Biden getting vaccinated and boosted for COVID was causing his physical and cognitive decline.  While there are valid questions about Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline as to whether he‚Äôll serve a full 2nd term Boebert‚Äôs take is pure nonsense.,2024-07-13 10:18:51 GMT

But the heart of Biden‚Äôs speech was a lengthy detailed attack on what Trump did when he was in the White House before ‚Äï and what he could do if he gets back in next year.  Biden singled out the provisions of ‚ÄúProject 2025‚Äù a right-wing agenda published by the conservative Heritage Foundation that envisions a second Trump term dramatically expanding the powers of the presidency downsizing the welfare state and rolling back reproductive rights. Its authors include prominent former and current Trump advisers though Trump has recently tried to distance himself from the document.   ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to stand up for women in America we‚Äôre going to protect contraception we‚Äôre going to protect IVF we‚Äôre going to restore Roe v. Wade as law of the land‚Äù Biden said Friday.   Biden was just as methodical in attacking Trump personally calling out the former president as a ‚Äúconvicted criminal‚Äù who would destroy democracy if he had the chance.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to stop treating politics like entertainment‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúAnother four years of Donald Trump is deadly serious.‚Äú  ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the nominee of the Democratic Party the only Democrat or Republican who has ever beaten Donald Trump‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm going to beat him again.‚Äù  Biden acknowledged his age and occasional rhetorical stumbles and near the start of his speech he seemed to lose track of his thoughts briefly while introducing members of the Michigan delegations in Congress.   But by and large Biden seemed fired up feeding off the raucous crowd. He even took a little skip in the middle of his characteristically deliberate walk off the stage.   Biden also threw shade at party elites and the media the latter of whom he said were ignoring Trump‚Äôs own frequently incoherent rants.   ‚ÄúTrump is getting a free pass‚Äù Biden said.   It‚Äôs not clear how much performances like Friday‚Äôs rally will satisfy Democrats who are worried that Biden cannot perform as well in high-pressure unscripted settings such as last month‚Äôs presidential debate when he failed to make precisely the sort of case he did here on Friday evening.

Joe Biden has insisted on running for re-election despite two significant gaffes at the NATO summit and an increasing number of Democrats calling on him to step down. His performances at the Washington event were viewed as make-or-break for the 81-year-old who had a dismal debate performance against competitor Donald Trump last month.

Early Thursday Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert rhetorically asked online ‚ÄúI wonder what could have caused Joe Biden‚Äôs rapid physical and cognitive decline?‚Äù But her choice to include four additional photos of Biden getting vaccinations revealed the shallowness of her concern.   Boebert has aggressively pushed the idea that Covid-19 vaccines are unsafe and dangerous accusing door-to-door vaccinators at the height of the pandemic of being ‚Äúneedle Nazis‚Äù and claiming that instituting a mandatory vaccine network would be akin to ‚Äúcommunist China.‚Äù In April the Colorado congresswoman became a target for the conspiracy she helped inflame battling conspiracy theorists after she suffered a medical emergency.

0,Joe Biden,['us politics'  'biden administration'  'democrats'  'immigrant rights'  'immigrants'  'immigration'  'refugees'  'asylum seekers'],plethoraworldatlas,The Dems‚Äô Border Security Push Repeats the Mistakes of the Clinton-Era Crime Bill | Common Dreams  As an organizer working on death penalty issues in 1994 I watched in horror as Democrats‚Äîled by then-U.S. President Bill Clinton‚Äîcaved to Republican ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù rhetoric and passed the largest law enforcement bill in U.S. history‚Äîa move now widely seen as one of the most consequential legislative setbacks in modern times for people of color.  Today as leader of a national immigrants‚Äô rights advocacy organization I am again horrified as Democrats ignore the lessons of that colossal moral and policy failure and double down on a misguided political strategy to outdo Republican extremism on immigration.  Democrats would be wise to avoid their past mistakes. Instead President Joe Biden and his Senate counterparts recently adopted Republicans‚Äô ‚Äútough on immigration‚Äù rhetoric in a failed bid to pass a sweeping border bill that would upend long-established asylum protections and resembles some of the worst government sanctioned cruelties we saw under former President Donald Trump.  Fortunately it was always clear this bill would fail a second time when Democrats put it up for a vote again in May. Still some of its worst provisions were implemented with President Biden‚Äôs subsequent asylum executive order. The long-term consequences of the Democratic Party embracing this cruel approach for political expediency could cause lasting damage for decades.  The Clinton-era crime bill‚Äîchampioned in Congress by then-Senator Joe Biden‚Äîshould offer Democrats a clear warning about legislating out of fear for a perceived political gain. Billed as an answer for a society grappling with addiction poverty and inequality it instead devastated Black and brown communities helping to drive mass incarceration with no significant reduction in crime. Thirty years after the bill‚Äôs passage policymakers across the political spectrum have disavowed the bill‚Äôs punitive approach. Many of these unlikely partners have become allies on many justice reform issues including Trump‚Äôs First Step Act.  Like the crime bill we know that the bipartisan border bill‚Äôs ‚Äútough‚Äù measures are not real solutions to our overwhelmed and severely outdated immigration system. We know this because the U.S. has already squandered billions of taxpayer dollars in the pursuit of deadly deterrence strategies and bolstering border enforcement. After decades of misdirecting investments into hardening the border including four dystopian years of chaos under Trump the data shows that this approach does not work.  While this border bill would not help solve our problems its consequences‚Äîeven of just propping it up with its accompanying anti-immigrant rhetoric‚Äîwill almost certainly fall disproportionately on Black and brown people. Democrats are once again showing that they are willing to sell out communities of color to look ‚Äútough.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs not forget that Biden and Democrats won in 2020 with the largest multiracial multigenerational coalition this country has ever seen. And yet just like in the ‚Äò90s Democrats are selling out this coalition trading perceived short-term gains for the long-term suffering of the very communities that mobilized to put them in power.  History will not be kind to such choices.,2024-07-13 13:44:02 GMT
22,Joe Biden,['politics'  'donald trump'  'potus'  'scotus'  'heritage foundation'  'trump'  'democracy'  'democrats'  'republicans'  'maga'  'maga morons'],ngdrb,The Growing Dangers of the MAGA Movement The ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù (MAGA) movement spearheaded by former President Donald Trump has become a prominent political force in the United States. While its supporters claim it champions patriotism and traditional American values the movement has increasingly been associated with extremist ideologies posing significant threats to American democracy social cohesion and national stability.  Core Beliefs and Goals At its core the MAGA movement promotes a narrow exclusionary vision of American identity rooted in nativism white Christian nationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment. It espouses a nostalgic longing for an idealized past when America was supposedly ‚Äúgreat‚Äù often interpreted as a time of unchallenged white Christian dominance. The movement‚Äôs rhetoric frequently portrays immigrants racial and religious minorities and progressive values as existential threats to this perceived traditional American way of life.  One of the movement‚Äôs central goals is to reshape the American political landscape by dismantling established norms institutions and checks and balances. This includes undermining the independence of the judiciary weakening the separation of powers and eroding the integrity of democratic processes such as free and fair elections. The movement has consistently sought to consolidate power and marginalize dissenting voices often through the perpetuation of conspiracy theories and the demonization of perceived enemies.  Ties to Extremist Ideologies While the MAGA movement claims to reject extremism its rhetoric and actions have increasingly aligned with far-right white nationalist and anti-democratic ideologies. The movement has provided a mainstream platform for individuals and groups that espouse hateful discriminatory and often violent beliefs.  The overlap between the MAGA movement and extremist groups has become increasingly apparent with many prominent figures within the movement embracing or failing to condemn racist xenophobic and anti-Semitic ideologies. This normalization of extremist ideologies has contributed to the mainstreaming of hate speech conspiracy theories and the vilification of marginalized communities.  Moreover the movement‚Äôs unwavering support for former President Trump even in the face of his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results has further solidified its ties to anti-democratic forces. The events of January 6th 2021 when MAGA supporters violently stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power highlighted the movement‚Äôs potential for inciting violence and undermining the foundations of American democracy.  Impact on American Democracy The MAGA movement‚Äôs assault on democratic norms and institutions poses grave threats to the integrity of American democracy. Its efforts to undermine the credibility of elections the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the press have eroded public trust in the very pillars that uphold the nation‚Äôs democratic system.  The movement‚Äôs embrace of conspiracy theories and disinformation has fueled a profound erosion of shared reality making it increasingly difficult to engage in constructive political discourse and find common ground. This polarization has paralyzed meaningful policymaking and exacerbated societal divisions hindering the nation‚Äôs ability to address pressing challenges effectively.  Furthermore the movement‚Äôs rhetoric and actions have contributed to a toxic political climate where dissent is often met with hostility intimidation and threats of violence. This chilling effect on free speech and open debate undermines the principles of a vibrant democracy and risks silencing legitimate voices and perspectives.  Threats to Social Cohesion and National Stability The MAGA movement‚Äôs divisive and exclusionary rhetoric has profound implications for social cohesion and national stability. Its vilification of marginalized communities and promotion of tribalism has fueled a resurgence of hate crimes discrimination and societal tensions eroding the nation‚Äôs diversity and unity.  The movement‚Äôs embrace of conspiracy theories and disinformation has also contributed to the erosion of trust in public institutions mainstream media and established sources of information. This has created an environment where misinformation and disinformation can thrive making it increasingly difficult to address complex societal challenges based on facts and evidence.  Moreover the movement‚Äôs glorification of violence and its resistance to peaceful transfers of power pose direct threats to national stability. The events of January 6th 2021 demonstrated the potential for the MAGA movement‚Äôs rhetoric and actions to incite civil unrest and undermine the foundations of the nation‚Äôs democratic system.  Conclusion The MAGA movement while purporting to champion patriotism and traditional American values has become increasingly associated with extremist ideologies anti-democratic tendencies and threats to social cohesion and national stability. Its narrow exclusionary vision of American identity promotion of conspiracy theories and embrace of divisive rhetoric have eroded democratic norms fueled societal tensions and undermined the nation‚Äôs ability to address pressing challenges effectively.  As the movement continues to gain momentum and influence it is imperative for all Americans to recognize the grave dangers it poses and to actively defend the principles of democracy pluralism and the rule of law. Failure to address the underlying issues that have given rise to the MAGA movement‚Äôs appeal and to counter its extremist tendencies risks further polarization civil unrest and the erosion of the democratic foundations that have sustained the United States for over two centuries.,2024-07-13 13:31:54 GMT

Boebert has aggressively pushed the idea that Covid-19 vaccines are unsafe and dangerous accusing door-to-door vaccinators at the height of the pandemic of being ‚Äúneedle Nazis‚Äù and claiming that instituting a mandatory vaccine network would be akin to ‚Äúcommunist China.‚Äù In April the Colorado congresswoman became a target for the conspiracy she helped inflame battling conspiracy theorists after she suffered a medical emergency.  Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) ghoulishly trafficked in anti-vaccine conspiracism by baselessly suggesting that President Joe Biden getting vaccinated and boosted for COVID was causing his physical and cognitive decline.  While there are valid questions about Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline as to whether he‚Äôll serve a full 2nd term Boebert‚Äôs take is pure nonsense.,2024-07-13 10:18:51 GMT

But the heart of Biden‚Äôs speech was a lengthy detailed attack on what Trump did when he was in the White House before ‚Äï and what he could do if he gets back in next year.  Biden singled out the provisions of ‚ÄúProject 2025‚Äù a right-wing agenda published by the conservative Heritage Foundation that envisions a second Trump term dramatically expanding the powers of the presidency downsizing the welfare state and rolling back reproductive rights. Its authors include prominent former and current Trump advisers though Trump has recently tried to distance himself from the document.   ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to stand up for women in America we‚Äôre going to protect contraception we‚Äôre going to protect IVF we‚Äôre going to restore Roe v. Wade as law of the land‚Äù Biden said Friday.   Biden was just as methodical in attacking Trump personally calling out the former president as a ‚Äúconvicted criminal‚Äù who would destroy democracy if he had the chance.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to stop treating politics like entertainment‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúAnother four years of Donald Trump is deadly serious.‚Äú  ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the nominee of the Democratic Party the only Democrat or Republican who has ever beaten Donald Trump‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm going to beat him again.‚Äù  Biden acknowledged his age and occasional rhetorical stumbles and near the start of his speech he seemed to lose track of his thoughts briefly while introducing members of the Michigan delegations in Congress.   But by and large Biden seemed fired up feeding off the raucous crowd. He even took a little skip in the middle of his characteristically deliberate walk off the stage.   Biden also threw shade at party elites and the media the latter of whom he said were ignoring Trump‚Äôs own frequently incoherent rants.   ‚ÄúTrump is getting a free pass‚Äù Biden said.   It‚Äôs not clear how much performances like Friday‚Äôs rally will satisfy Democrats who are worried that Biden cannot perform as well in high-pressure unscripted settings such as last month‚Äôs presidential debate when he failed to make precisely the sort of case he did here on Friday evening.

14,Joe Biden,['us politics'  'vote'],tiggymalvern,Nobody I know wanted Biden to run again. Nobody wanted a Biden-Trump rematch and all the polls said so a year ago or more. Biden should have declared two years ago that he would be a one term President the Dems should have held primaries for his replacement and we should have been bigging up our new candidate all this time. Chances are we would have got someone like Gavin Newsom.  But Biden didn‚Äôt. And now it is quite simply too late. There are four months left until the election. All the funds that Biden has been raising all this time for his campaign cannot simply be transferred to a new candidate. That would be illegal. There is not time for a new candidate to be chosen raise funds and run. It is impossible to win that way. So we‚Äôre stuck with Biden even if the chances of him winning are shrinking by the day.  There would barely be time to replace Biden with Kamala by default even if we announced that today and a lot of Dems dislike Kamala. Plus I have serious concerns that a large enough percentage of the American public simply will not vote for a woman for that to tip the balance. Even if only 2 or 3% of Independents are misogynistic enough for that to be a factor those are the margins this election will be won on. I honestly believe that was a factor in Hillary losing in 2016 along with the fact that people just didn‚Äôt like her. Kamala is also a woman who is not considered ‚Äòlikeable‚Äô.  Dems need to STOP calling for Biden to stand down. Anyone publicly stating that he needs to be replaced is just doing Trump‚Äôs work for him. We need to put up shut up hold our noses and vote for goddamn Biden even if he is going senile or has Parkinson‚Äôs. There are plans in place for that. This is why we have a Veep and an entire Presidential staff - because there are plans for a sick or dead President. There are no plans to stop an authoritarian President who has been given immunity in advance for anything he might do.,2024-07-13 14:40:57 GMT

What began as a catchy campaign slogan has evolved into a broad ideological movement with tens of millions of devoted adherents.   While supporters view it as a patriotic effort to restore traditional American values and strength critics see the MAGA movement as an existential threat to democracy pluralism and the rule of law in the United States. This essay will examine the origins and evolution of the MAGA movement analyze its core ideological tenets and tactics and explore the various ways in which it poses growing dangers to American democratic institutions and social cohesion.   By synthesizing research expert analysis and recent events we can better understand the nature of this movement and the challenges it presents.  Origins and Evolution of the MAGA Movement   The roots of the MAGA movement can be traced back to long-standing currents of populism nativism and anti-establishment sentiment in American politics. However it was Donald Trump who managed to coalesce these disparate threads into a potent political force during his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump‚Äôs promise to ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù resonated with millions of Americans who felt left behind by globalization demographic changes and shifting cultural norms.  His brash outsider persona and willingness to buck political correctness attracted those who were disillusioned with conventional politicians. Trump tapped into feelings of economic anxiety cultural displacement and resentment toward coastal elites to build a devoted base of support.   After his surprise victory in 2016 the MAGA slogan transformed from a campaign catchphrase into a full-fledged movement and identity. Trump supporters eagerly adopted the MAGA label proudly wearing red hats and using the hashtag online. The movement took on a life of its own with Trump as its figurehead but extending well beyond just one man.   Throughout Trump‚Äôs presidency the MAGA movement continued to evolve and radicalize. As Trump faced investigations impeachment proceedings and constant media scrutiny his base became increasingly defensive and hostile toward perceived enemies.   Conspiracy theories like QAnon found fertile ground among MAGA adherents. The movement adopted an increasingly apocalyptic and militant tone portraying itself as the last line of defense against sinister forces trying to destroy America.   The movement reached a crescendo - and a dangerous breaking point - on January 6 2021 when thousands of Trump supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. This event crystallized the growing extremism within the MAGA movement and its willingness to subvert democratic processes. Even after Trump left office the MAGA movement has endured as a powerful force in American politics. It has reshaped the Republican Party in Trump‚Äôs image and continues to exert enormous influence through primaries fundraising and setting the terms of political debate on the right.   Core Tenets and Ideology  While the MAGA movement encompasses a range of views several core ideological tenets have emerged as central to its worldview:  America First Nationalism: The movement advocates an ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù foreign and economic policy rejecting globalism in favor of national sovereignty and protectionism. Anti-immigration: Restricting both legal and illegal immigration is a top priority often couched in nativist rhetoric about preserving American culture. Cultural traditionalism: MAGA adherents push back against progressive social changes championing traditional gender roles religious values and a nostalgic view of America‚Äôs past. Deep state paranoia: The movement is deeply distrustful of government institutions mainstream media and other power centers believing them to be corrupt and working against the interests of everyday Americans. Cult of personality: Loyalty to Donald Trump personally is a defining feature with the movement portraying him as a messianic figure fighting dark forces. Anti-‚Äúwokeness‚Äù: The MAGA movement positions itself in staunch opposition to progressive ideas about systemic racism LGBTQ+ rights and other social justice causes. Election denialism: Following Trump‚Äôs lead much of the movement refuses to accept the legitimacy of the 2020 election results pushing baseless fraud claims. Conspiratorial thinking: The movement is prone to embracing and amplifying conspiracy theories that support its worldview from QAnon to COVID-19 misinformation. These ideological pillars form the foundation of the MAGA movement‚Äôs grievance-fueled politics and its antagonistic stance toward democratic institutions and norms.   Tactics and Strategies   The MAGA movement employs a range of tactics to advance its goals and expand its influence:  Social media mobilization: Savvy use of platforms like Twitter Facebook and newer alt-tech sites allows rapid dissemination of messaging and coordination of grassroots action. Alternative media ecosystem: A network of right-wing news outlets podcasts and influencers creates an insular information bubble for supporters. Intimidation and threats: Movement figures often use violent rhetoric and veiled threats to intimidate opponents and critics. Litigation and legal challenges: An army of pro-Trump lawyers file dubious lawsuits to challenge election results and other perceived slights. Primary challenges: The movement targets ‚Äúdisloyal‚Äù Republicans with primary opponents to enforce ideological conformity. Propaganda and disinformation: Coordinated campaigns spread misleading narratives and outright falsehoods to shape public opinion. Protests and rallies: Mass gatherings serve to energize the base and project a show of force. Infiltration of local offices: The movement has pushed supporters to take over low-level government positions like election boards and school boards. These tactics have proven effective at solidifying the movement‚Äôs power within the Republican Party and exerting outsized influence on the national political conversation.Growing Dangers to DemocracyThe MAGA movement poses several interconnected threats to the stability and functioning of American democracy:  Undermining faith in elections Perhaps the most immediate danger is the movement‚Äôs persistent efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of U.S. elections. By pushing baseless claims of widespread voter fraud and refusing to accept unfavorable results MAGA leaders are actively eroding public trust in the democratic process.This delegitimization of elections has several alarming consequences. It provides justification for new voting restrictions that disproportionately impact minority communities. It increases the risk of political violence as we saw on January 6th when MAGA supporters felt empowered to use force to ‚Äústop the steal.‚Äù And it creates a permission structure for future attempts to overturn legitimate election results.If a large segment of the population no longer believes in the basic mechanics of democracy it becomes nearly impossible to have peaceful transfers of power or to solve problems through normal political channels.  2.Assault on the rule of law  The MAGA movement has shown a troubling willingness to disregard the rule of law when it conflicts with their goals. This manifests in several ways:  Refusing to comply with lawful subpoenas and oversight efforts Pardoning political allies convicted of crimes Interfering in ongoing investigations for political purposes Calling for the imprisonment of political opponents without due process Flouting ethics rules and profiting from public office By treating the law as optional or applicable only to their enemies MAGA leaders set a dangerous precedent that threatens the foundations of constitutional governance.  3.Embracing political violence  While not universal among supporters there is a strong current of militancy within the MAGA movement that views violence as a legitimate political tool. This mindset has led to increased threats against public officials journalists and even fellow Republicans deemed insufficiently loyal.The events of January 6th represented a shocking escalation demonstrating that a significant portion of the movement is willing to use force to achieve its ends. Even more concerning is the way many MAGA leaders have subsequently downplayed or justified the Capitol attack.This normalization of political violence profoundly destabilizes democracy and makes peaceful resolution of differences far more difficult  4.Undermining truth and shared reality  The MAGA movement‚Äôs loose relationship with factual reality represents another serious threat to functional democracy. By embracing conspiracy theories rejecting scientific expertise and creating alternative information ecosystems the movement erodes the possibility of having good-faith debates based on a shared set of facts.When a large segment of the population lives in a completely different epistemic reality it becomes nearly impossible to find common ground or craft effective policy solutions. This rejection of truth and expertise also leaves followers vulnerable to manipulation and extreme ideas.  5.Weakening of democratic institutions  MAGA leaders have waged a sustained assault on the legitimacy of key democratic institutions like the justice system intelligence agencies the press and career civil servants. By portraying these entities as part of a nefarious ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù working against the people the movement weakens public trust in the very institutions needed for democracy to function.This institutional erosion creates a vicious cycle as weakened institutions are less able to serve as a check on abuses of power leading to further deterioration.6.  Personality cult dynamics  The MAGA movement‚Äôs intense devotion to Donald Trump personally introduces instability and irrationality into the political system. When loyalty to an individual trumps commitment to principles or the national interest it opens the door to significant abuses of power.The personalization of politics around Trump also makes it more difficult to resolve political differences through normal democratic means. Policy debates get reduced to whether one supports or opposes Trump as an individual.  7.Minority rule tendencies  There are strong anti-democratic currents within the MAGA movement that seek to entrench minority rule through a variety of mechanisms:  Extreme gerrymandering Voter suppression targeting Democratic-leaning groups Exploiting the electoral college and Senate‚Äôs rural bias Court packing to lock in a conservative judiciary Calls to repeal the 17th Amendment (direct election of Senators) These efforts to insulate MAGA power from the will of the majority represent a fundamental threat to the principle of popular sovereignty.  8.Scapegoating and demonitiization  The MAGA movement‚Äôs rhetoric often seeks to divide Americans into ‚Äúreal‚Äù patriots versus dangerous ‚Äúothers‚Äù - whether immigrants racial minorities liberals or the nebulous ‚Äúelite.‚Äù This deliberate ‚Äúus vs. them‚Äù framing corrodes social cohesion and paints political opponents as existential enemies rather than fellow citizens with differing views.Taken to extremes this dehumanization of the opposition can be used to justify anti-democratic actions or even violence in the name of defending the ‚Äúreal America.  Potential Future Trajectories  Looking ahead there are several potential paths the MAGA movement could take each with significant implications for American democracy:  Moderation and reintegration: In this optimistic scenario the movement gradually moderates its views and tactics allowing for its reintegration into normal democratic politics. This would likely require new leadership and a rejection of its most extreme elements. Continued radicalization: The movement could continue down the path of escalating extremism embracing more conspiratorial thinking and explicit calls for anti-democratic action. This risks further political violence and democratic backsliding. Splintering: Internal divisions could cause the movement to fragment into competing factions potentially diminishing its overall influence but also creating space for even more radical offshoots. Institutional capture: The movement could succeed in taking over the Republican Party entirely and gaining control of key government institutions allowing for the implementation of its agenda through official channels. Authoritarian takeover: In a worst-case scenario MAGA leaders could leverage a crisis or electoral victory to rapidly dismantle democratic guardrails and institute authoritarian rule similar to what has occurred in countries like Hungary. The trajectory the movement takes will depend on a variety of factors including the actions of MAGA leaders the response of democratic institutions economic conditions and unforeseen events that could reshape the political landscape. Responding to the Threat Given the serious dangers posed by the MAGA movement a robust democratic response is necessary. Some potential strategies include:  Strengthening democratic institutions: Shoring up the integrity and independence of bodies like the Justice Department election administration and civil service to withstand political pressure. Civic education: Improving public understanding of democratic processes and values to build resilience against anti-democratic messaging. Media literacy: Equipping citizens with the tools to critically evaluate information sources and resist disinformation. Bipartisan coalition building: Forging alliances between Democrats and non-MAGA Republicans to present a united front in defense of democratic norms. Economic policy: Addressing the legitimate economic grievances that fuel support for the movement through inclusive growth policies. Legal accountability: Ensuring that violations of law and democratic norms face appropriate consequences regardless of political affiliation. Depolarization efforts: Investing in initiatives that bridge partisan divides and rebuild social cohesion at the community level. Election reform: Implementing reforms to increase faith in election integrity while expanding access to voting. Countering extremism: Providing off-ramps and support for those at risk of radicalization into anti-democratic ideologies. Conclusion  The MAGA movement represents one of the most significant challenges to American democracy in generations. Its potent mix of grievance politics personality cult dynamics and anti-democratic tendencies poses a multifaceted threat to the stability and functioning of the country‚Äôs political system.  While the movement taps into some legitimate frustrations with the status quo its proposed solutions and tactics risk undermining the very foundations of constitutional governance. The normalization of political violence erosion of truth and delegitimization of democratic institutions create a volatile situation with the potential for severe instability.   Responding effectively to this threat will require a clear-eyed understanding of the movement‚Äôs appeal and tactics coupled with proactive efforts to strengthen democratic guardrails and rebuild civic cohesion. The future of American democracy may well hinge on the ability to successfully navigate this challenge in the years to come.   Ultimately preserving a healthy democracy requires constant vigilance and renewal. The MAGA movement serves as a stark reminder that even long-established democracies are not immune to authoritarian impulses. By understanding the nature of this threat Americans across the political spectrum can work to uphold the principles of democratic self-governance for future generations.,2024-07-13 14:30:23 GMT

Today as leader of a national immigrants‚Äô rights advocacy organization I am again horrified as Democrats ignore the lessons of that colossal moral and policy failure and double down on a misguided political strategy to outdo Republican extremism on immigration.  Democrats would be wise to avoid their past mistakes. Instead President Joe Biden and his Senate counterparts recently adopted Republicans‚Äô ‚Äútough on immigration‚Äù rhetoric in a failed bid to pass a sweeping border bill that would upend long-established asylum protections and resembles some of the worst government sanctioned cruelties we saw under former President Donald Trump.  Fortunately it was always clear this bill would fail a second time when Democrats put it up for a vote again in May. Still some of its worst provisions were implemented with President Biden‚Äôs subsequent asylum executive order. The long-term consequences of the Democratic Party embracing this cruel approach for political expediency could cause lasting damage for decades.  The Clinton-era crime bill‚Äîchampioned in Congress by then-Senator Joe Biden‚Äîshould offer Democrats a clear warning about legislating out of fear for a perceived political gain. Billed as an answer for a society grappling with addiction poverty and inequality it instead devastated Black and brown communities helping to drive mass incarceration with no significant reduction in crime. Thirty years after the bill‚Äôs passage policymakers across the political spectrum have disavowed the bill‚Äôs punitive approach. Many of these unlikely partners have become allies on many justice reform issues including Trump‚Äôs First Step Act.  Like the crime bill we know that the bipartisan border bill‚Äôs ‚Äútough‚Äù measures are not real solutions to our overwhelmed and severely outdated immigration system. We know this because the U.S. has already squandered billions of taxpayer dollars in the pursuit of deadly deterrence strategies and bolstering border enforcement. After decades of misdirecting investments into hardening the border including four dystopian years of chaos under Trump the data shows that this approach does not work.  While this border bill would not help solve our problems its consequences‚Äîeven of just propping it up with its accompanying anti-immigrant rhetoric‚Äîwill almost certainly fall disproportionately on Black and brown people. Democrats are once again showing that they are willing to sell out communities of color to look ‚Äútough.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs not forget that Biden and Democrats won in 2020 with the largest multiracial multigenerational coalition this country has ever seen. And yet just like in the ‚Äò90s Democrats are selling out this coalition trading perceived short-term gains for the long-term suffering of the very communities that mobilized to put them in power.  History will not be kind to such choices.,2024-07-13 13:44:02 GMT
22,Joe Biden,['politics'  'donald trump'  'potus'  'scotus'  'heritage foundation'  'trump'  'democracy'  'democrats'  'republicans'  'maga'  'maga morons'],ngdrb,The Growing Dangers of the MAGA Movement The ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù (MAGA) movement spearheaded by former President Donald Trump has become a prominent political force in the United States. While its supporters claim it champions patriotism and traditional American values the movement has increasingly been associated with extremist ideologies posing significant threats to American democracy social cohesion and national stability.  Core Beliefs and Goals At its core the MAGA movement promotes a narrow exclusionary vision of American identity rooted in nativism white Christian nationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment. It espouses a nostalgic longing for an idealized past when America was supposedly ‚Äúgreat‚Äù often interpreted as a time of unchallenged white Christian dominance. The movement‚Äôs rhetoric frequently portrays immigrants racial and religious minorities and progressive values as existential threats to this perceived traditional American way of life.  One of the movement‚Äôs central goals is to reshape the American political landscape by dismantling established norms institutions and checks and balances. This includes undermining the independence of the judiciary weakening the separation of powers and eroding the integrity of democratic processes such as free and fair elections. The movement has consistently sought to consolidate power and marginalize dissenting voices often through the perpetuation of conspiracy theories and the demonization of perceived enemies.  Ties to Extremist Ideologies While the MAGA movement claims to reject extremism its rhetoric and actions have increasingly aligned with far-right white nationalist and anti-democratic ideologies. The movement has provided a mainstream platform for individuals and groups that espouse hateful discriminatory and often violent beliefs.  The overlap between the MAGA movement and extremist groups has become increasingly apparent with many prominent figures within the movement embracing or failing to condemn racist xenophobic and anti-Semitic ideologies. This normalization of extremist ideologies has contributed to the mainstreaming of hate speech conspiracy theories and the vilification of marginalized communities.  Moreover the movement‚Äôs unwavering support for former President Trump even in the face of his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results has further solidified its ties to anti-democratic forces. The events of January 6th 2021 when MAGA supporters violently stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power highlighted the movement‚Äôs potential for inciting violence and undermining the foundations of American democracy.  Impact on American Democracy The MAGA movement‚Äôs assault on democratic norms and institutions poses grave threats to the integrity of American democracy. Its efforts to undermine the credibility of elections the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the press have eroded public trust in the very pillars that uphold the nation‚Äôs democratic system.  The movement‚Äôs embrace of conspiracy theories and disinformation has fueled a profound erosion of shared reality making it increasingly difficult to engage in constructive political discourse and find common ground. This polarization has paralyzed meaningful policymaking and exacerbated societal divisions hindering the nation‚Äôs ability to address pressing challenges effectively.  Furthermore the movement‚Äôs rhetoric and actions have contributed to a toxic political climate where dissent is often met with hostility intimidation and threats of violence. This chilling effect on free speech and open debate undermines the principles of a vibrant democracy and risks silencing legitimate voices and perspectives.  Threats to Social Cohesion and National Stability The MAGA movement‚Äôs divisive and exclusionary rhetoric has profound implications for social cohesion and national stability. Its vilification of marginalized communities and promotion of tribalism has fueled a resurgence of hate crimes discrimination and societal tensions eroding the nation‚Äôs diversity and unity.  The movement‚Äôs embrace of conspiracy theories and disinformation has also contributed to the erosion of trust in public institutions mainstream media and established sources of information. This has created an environment where misinformation and disinformation can thrive making it increasingly difficult to address complex societal challenges based on facts and evidence.  Moreover the movement‚Äôs glorification of violence and its resistance to peaceful transfers of power pose direct threats to national stability. The events of January 6th 2021 demonstrated the potential for the MAGA movement‚Äôs rhetoric and actions to incite civil unrest and undermine the foundations of the nation‚Äôs democratic system.  Conclusion The MAGA movement while purporting to champion patriotism and traditional American values has become increasingly associated with extremist ideologies anti-democratic tendencies and threats to social cohesion and national stability. Its narrow exclusionary vision of American identity promotion of conspiracy theories and embrace of divisive rhetoric have eroded democratic norms fueled societal tensions and undermined the nation‚Äôs ability to address pressing challenges effectively.  As the movement continues to gain momentum and influence it is imperative for all Americans to recognize the grave dangers it poses and to actively defend the principles of democracy pluralism and the rule of law.

Throughout his presidency President Biden has pursued an ambitious agenda aimed at addressing these pressing issues and advancing key policy priorities. In this essay we will examine some of the notable accomplishments of Joe Biden during his time in office and the impact of his leadership on the nation.  One of the most significant accomplishments of President Biden during his presidency has been his administration‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon taking office President Biden made the pandemic a top priority and swiftly implemented a national strategy to combat the spread of the virus and accelerate the vaccination campaign.  Under his leadership the administration successfully exceeded its initial goal of administering 100 million vaccine doses within the first 100 days ultimately surpassing 200 million doses. This aggressive vaccination effort has been instrumental in curbing the spread of the virus and has contributed to a significant reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths across the country.    In addition to his focus on public health President Biden has made substantial strides in revitalizing the American economy in the wake of the pandemic. The administration‚Äôs American Rescue Plan a comprehensive COVID-19 relief package provided much-needed financial assistance to individuals families and businesses impacted by the economic downturn. The plan included direct stimulus payments to Americans extended unemployment benefits support for small businesses and funding for vaccine distribution and testing.   President Biden‚Äôs economic agenda has also centered on job creation and infrastructure investment culminating in the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law a historic legislation that allocates substantial funding for modernizing the nation‚Äôs infrastructure creating millions of jobs and bolstering economic growth. Furthermore President Biden has been a vocal advocate for advancing racial equity and social justice in the United States. His administration has taken concrete steps to address systemic inequalities and promote inclusivity including the signing of executive orders to combat discrimination promote fair housing and strengthen tribal sovereignty.   Additionally President Biden signed into law the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act establishing Juneteenth as a federal holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the United States. These actions underscore the administration‚Äôs commitment to confronting the legacy of racism and fostering a more equitable society for all Americans.    Moreover President Biden has demonstrated a strong commitment to combating climate change and advancing environmental sustainability.    His administration rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change signaling a renewed dedication to global cooperation in addressing the climate crisis. In November 2021 President Biden convened a virtual Leaders Summit on Climate bringing together world leaders to discuss ambitious measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the transition to clean energy.   Additionally the administration has unveiled a comprehensive plan to invest in clean energy infrastructure promote energy efficiency and prioritize environmental justice aiming to position the United States as a global leader in the fight against climate change.   In the realm of foreign policy President Biden has sought to reassert American leadership on the world stage and rebuild alliances with international partners. His administration has prioritized diplomacy and multilateral engagement working to address global challenges such as nuclear proliferation cybersecurity threats and human rights abuses.   President Biden has reaffirmed the United States‚Äô commitment to NATO and other key alliances signaling a departure from the isolationist policies of the previous administration. His approach to foreign affairs has emphasized the importance of collaboration and collective action in tackling shared global concerns fostering a more cohesive and cooperative international order. Furthermore   President Biden has been a steadfast proponent of expanding access to affordable healthcare and strengthening the Affordable Care Act. His administration has taken steps to bolster the ACA including increasing enrollment outreach expanding coverage options and lowering healthcare costs for millions of Americans.   President Biden has also championed efforts to address mental health challenges and substance abuse disorders recognizing the critical importance of mental and behavioral health in overall well-being.   In conclusion President Joe Biden has achieved a range of significant accomplishments during his tenure in office from his swift and effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic to his ambitious efforts to revitalize the economy promote racial equity combat climate change and reinvigorate America‚Äôs role in global affairs.   His leadership has been marked by a steadfast commitment to addressing pressing domestic and international challenges and advancing a progressive policy agenda aimed at fostering a more equitable resilient and prosperous future for the nation. As his presidency continues to unfold the enduring impact of his accomplishments is likely to shape the trajectory of the United States for years to come leaving a lasting imprint on the fabric of American society and the global community.,2024-07-13 15:49:48 GMT

14,Joe Biden,['us politics'  'vote'],tiggymalvern,Nobody I know wanted Biden to run again. Nobody wanted a Biden-Trump rematch and all the polls said so a year ago or more. Biden should have declared two years ago that he would be a one term President the Dems should have held primaries for his replacement and we should have been bigging up our new candidate all this time. Chances are we would have got someone like Gavin Newsom.  But Biden didn‚Äôt. And now it is quite simply too late. There are four months left until the election. All the funds that Biden has been raising all this time for his campaign cannot simply be transferred to a new candidate. That would be illegal. There is not time for a new candidate to be chosen raise funds and run. It is impossible to win that way. So we‚Äôre stuck with Biden even if the chances of him winning are shrinking by the day.  There would barely be time to replace Biden with Kamala by default even if we announced that today and a lot of Dems dislike Kamala. Plus I have serious concerns that a large enough percentage of the American public simply will not vote for a woman for that to tip the balance. Even if only 2 or 3% of Independents are misogynistic enough for that to be a factor those are the margins this election will be won on. I honestly believe that was a factor in Hillary losing in 2016 along with the fact that people just didn‚Äôt like her. Kamala is also a woman who is not considered ‚Äòlikeable‚Äô.  Dems need to STOP calling for Biden to stand down. Anyone publicly stating that he needs to be replaced is just doing Trump‚Äôs work for him. We need to put up shut up hold our noses and vote for goddamn Biden even if he is going senile or has Parkinson‚Äôs. There are plans in place for that. This is why we have a Veep and an entire Presidential staff - because there are plans for a sick or dead President. There are no plans to stop an authoritarian President who has been given immunity in advance for anything he might do.,2024-07-13 14:40:57 GMT

What began as a catchy campaign slogan has evolved into a broad ideological movement with tens of millions of devoted adherents.   While supporters view it as a patriotic effort to restore traditional American values and strength critics see the MAGA movement as an existential threat to democracy pluralism and the rule of law in the United States. This essay will examine the origins and evolution of the MAGA movement analyze its core ideological tenets and tactics and explore the various ways in which it poses growing dangers to American democratic institutions and social cohesion.   By synthesizing research expert analysis and recent events we can better understand the nature of this movement and the challenges it presents.  Origins and Evolution of the MAGA Movement   The roots of the MAGA movement can be traced back to long-standing currents of populism nativism and anti-establishment sentiment in American politics. However it was Donald Trump who managed to coalesce these disparate threads into a potent political force during his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump‚Äôs promise to ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù resonated with millions of Americans who felt left behind by globalization demographic changes and shifting cultural norms.  His brash outsider persona and willingness to buck political correctness attracted those who were disillusioned with conventional politicians. Trump tapped into feelings of economic anxiety cultural displacement and resentment toward coastal elites to build a devoted base of support.   After his surprise victory in 2016 the MAGA slogan transformed from a campaign catchphrase into a full-fledged movement and identity. Trump supporters eagerly adopted the MAGA label proudly wearing red hats and using the hashtag online. The movement took on a life of its own with Trump as its figurehead but extending well beyond just one man.   Throughout Trump‚Äôs presidency the MAGA movement continued to evolve and radicalize. As Trump faced investigations impeachment proceedings and constant media scrutiny his base became increasingly defensive and hostile toward perceived enemies.   Conspiracy theories like QAnon found fertile ground among MAGA adherents. The movement adopted an increasingly apocalyptic and militant tone portraying itself as the last line of defense against sinister forces trying to destroy America.   The movement reached a crescendo - and a dangerous breaking point - on January 6 2021 when thousands of Trump supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. This event crystallized the growing extremism within the MAGA movement and its willingness to subvert democratic processes. Even after Trump left office the MAGA movement has endured as a powerful force in American politics. It has reshaped the Republican Party in Trump‚Äôs image and continues to exert enormous influence through primaries fundraising and setting the terms of political debate on the right.   Core Tenets and Ideology  While the MAGA movement encompasses a range of views several core ideological tenets have emerged as central to its worldview:  America First Nationalism: The movement advocates an ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù foreign and economic policy rejecting globalism in favor of national sovereignty and protectionism. Anti-immigration: Restricting both legal and illegal immigration is a top priority often couched in nativist rhetoric about preserving American culture. Cultural traditionalism: MAGA adherents push back against progressive social changes championing traditional gender roles religious values and a nostalgic view of America‚Äôs past. Deep state paranoia: The movement is deeply distrustful of government institutions mainstream media and other power centers believing them to be corrupt and working against the interests of everyday Americans. Cult of personality: Loyalty to Donald Trump personally is a defining feature with the movement portraying him as a messianic figure fighting dark forces. Anti-‚Äúwokeness‚Äù: The MAGA movement positions itself in staunch opposition to progressive ideas about systemic racism LGBTQ+ rights and other social justice causes. Election denialism: Following Trump‚Äôs lead much of the movement refuses to accept the legitimacy of the 2020 election results pushing baseless fraud claims. Conspiratorial thinking: The movement is prone to embracing and amplifying conspiracy theories that support its worldview from QAnon to COVID-19 misinformation. These ideological pillars form the foundation of the MAGA movement‚Äôs grievance-fueled politics and its antagonistic stance toward democratic institutions and norms.   Tactics and Strategies   The MAGA movement employs a range of tactics to advance its goals and expand its influence:  Social media mobilization: Savvy use of platforms like Twitter Facebook and newer alt-tech sites allows rapid dissemination of messaging and coordination of grassroots action. Alternative media ecosystem: A network of right-wing news outlets podcasts and influencers creates an insular information bubble for supporters. Intimidation and threats: Movement figures often use violent rhetoric and veiled threats to intimidate opponents and critics. Litigation and legal challenges: An army of pro-Trump lawyers file dubious lawsuits to challenge election results and other perceived slights. Primary challenges: The movement targets ‚Äúdisloyal‚Äù Republicans with primary opponents to enforce ideological conformity. Propaganda and disinformation: Coordinated campaigns spread misleading narratives and outright falsehoods to shape public opinion. Protests and rallies: Mass gatherings serve to energize the base and project a show of force. Infiltration of local offices: The movement has pushed supporters to take over low-level government positions like election boards and school boards. These tactics have proven effective at solidifying the movement‚Äôs power within the Republican Party and exerting outsized influence on the national political conversation.Growing Dangers to DemocracyThe MAGA movement poses several interconnected threats to the stability and functioning of American democracy:  Undermining faith in elections Perhaps the most immediate danger is the movement‚Äôs persistent efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of U.S. elections. By pushing baseless claims of widespread voter fraud and refusing to accept unfavorable results MAGA leaders are actively eroding public trust in the democratic process.This delegitimization of elections has several alarming consequences. It provides justification for new voting restrictions that disproportionately impact minority communities. It increases the risk of political violence as we saw on January 6th when MAGA supporters felt empowered to use force to ‚Äústop the steal.‚Äù And it creates a permission structure for future attempts to overturn legitimate election results.If a large segment of the population no longer believes in the basic mechanics of democracy it becomes nearly impossible to have peaceful transfers of power or to solve problems through normal political channels.  2.Assault on the rule of law  The MAGA movement has shown a troubling willingness to disregard the rule of law when it conflicts with their goals. This manifests in several ways:  Refusing to comply with lawful subpoenas and oversight efforts Pardoning political allies convicted of crimes Interfering in ongoing investigations for political purposes Calling for the imprisonment of political opponents without due process Flouting ethics rules and profiting from public office By treating the law as optional or applicable only to their enemies MAGA leaders set a dangerous precedent that threatens the foundations of constitutional governance.  3.Embracing political violence  While not universal among supporters there is a strong current of militancy within the MAGA movement that views violence as a legitimate political tool. This mindset has led to increased threats against public officials journalists and even fellow Republicans deemed insufficiently loyal.The events of January 6th represented a shocking escalation demonstrating that a significant portion of the movement is willing to use force to achieve its ends. Even more concerning is the way many MAGA leaders have subsequently downplayed or justified the Capitol attack.This normalization of political violence profoundly destabilizes democracy and makes peaceful resolution of differences far more difficult  4.Undermining truth and shared reality  The MAGA movement‚Äôs loose relationship with factual reality represents another serious threat to functional democracy. By embracing conspiracy theories rejecting scientific expertise and creating alternative information ecosystems the movement erodes the possibility of having good-faith debates based on a shared set of facts.When a large segment of the population lives in a completely different epistemic reality it becomes nearly impossible to find common ground or craft effective policy solutions. This rejection of truth and expertise also leaves followers vulnerable to manipulation and extreme ideas.  5.Weakening of democratic institutions  MAGA leaders have waged a sustained assault on the legitimacy of key democratic institutions like the justice system intelligence agencies the press and career civil servants. By portraying these entities as part of a nefarious ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù working against the people the movement weakens public trust in the very institutions needed for democracy to function.This institutional erosion creates a vicious cycle as weakened institutions are less able to serve as a check on abuses of power leading to further deterioration.6.  Personality cult dynamics  The MAGA movement‚Äôs intense devotion to Donald Trump personally introduces instability and irrationality into the political system. When loyalty to an individual trumps commitment to principles or the national interest it opens the door to significant abuses of power.The personalization of politics around Trump also makes it more difficult to resolve political differences through normal democratic means. Policy debates get reduced to whether one supports or opposes Trump as an individual.  7.Minority rule tendencies  There are strong anti-democratic currents within the MAGA movement that seek to entrench minority rule through a variety of mechanisms:  Extreme gerrymandering Voter suppression targeting Democratic-leaning groups Exploiting the electoral college and Senate‚Äôs rural bias Court packing to lock in a conservative judiciary Calls to repeal the 17th Amendment (direct election of Senators) These efforts to insulate MAGA power from the will of the majority represent a fundamental threat to the principle of popular sovereignty.  8.Scapegoating and demonitiization  The MAGA movement‚Äôs rhetoric often seeks to divide Americans into ‚Äúreal‚Äù patriots versus dangerous ‚Äúothers‚Äù - whether immigrants racial minorities liberals or the nebulous ‚Äúelite.‚Äù This deliberate ‚Äúus vs. them‚Äù framing corrodes social cohesion and paints political opponents as existential enemies rather than fellow citizens with differing views.Taken to extremes this dehumanization of the opposition can be used to justify anti-democratic actions or even violence in the name of defending the ‚Äúreal America.  Potential Future Trajectories  Looking ahead there are several potential paths the MAGA movement could take each with significant implications for American democracy:  Moderation and reintegration: In this optimistic scenario the movement gradually moderates its views and tactics allowing for its reintegration into normal democratic politics. This would likely require new leadership and a rejection of its most extreme elements. Continued radicalization: The movement could continue down the path of escalating extremism embracing more conspiratorial thinking and explicit calls for anti-democratic action. This risks further political violence and democratic backsliding. Splintering: Internal divisions could cause the movement to fragment into competing factions potentially diminishing its overall influence but also creating space for even more radical offshoots. Institutional capture: The movement could succeed in taking over the Republican Party entirely and gaining control of key government institutions allowing for the implementation of its agenda through official channels. Authoritarian takeover: In a worst-case scenario MAGA leaders could leverage a crisis or electoral victory to rapidly dismantle democratic guardrails and institute authoritarian rule similar to what has occurred in countries like Hungary. The trajectory the movement takes will depend on a variety of factors including the actions of MAGA leaders the response of democratic institutions economic conditions and unforeseen events that could reshape the political landscape. Responding to the Threat Given the serious dangers posed by the MAGA movement a robust democratic response is necessary. Some potential strategies include:  Strengthening democratic institutions: Shoring up the integrity and independence of bodies like the Justice Department election administration and civil service to withstand political pressure. Civic education: Improving public understanding of democratic processes and values to build resilience against anti-democratic messaging. Media literacy: Equipping citizens with the tools to critically evaluate information sources and resist disinformation. Bipartisan coalition building: Forging alliances between Democrats and non-MAGA Republicans to present a united front in defense of democratic norms. Economic policy: Addressing the legitimate economic grievances that fuel support for the movement through inclusive growth policies. Legal accountability: Ensuring that violations of law and democratic norms face appropriate consequences regardless of political affiliation. Depolarization efforts: Investing in initiatives that bridge partisan divides and rebuild social cohesion at the community level. Election reform: Implementing reforms to increase faith in election integrity while expanding access to voting. Countering extremism: Providing off-ramps and support for those at risk of radicalization into anti-democratic ideologies. Conclusion  The MAGA movement represents one of the most significant challenges to American democracy in generations. Its potent mix of grievance politics personality cult dynamics and anti-democratic tendencies poses a multifaceted threat to the stability and functioning of the country‚Äôs political system.  While the movement taps into some legitimate frustrations with the status quo its proposed solutions and tactics risk undermining the very foundations of constitutional governance. The normalization of political violence erosion of truth and delegitimization of democratic institutions create a volatile situation with the potential for severe instability.   Responding effectively to this threat will require a clear-eyed understanding of the movement‚Äôs appeal and tactics coupled with proactive efforts to strengthen democratic guardrails and rebuild civic cohesion. The future of American democracy may well hinge on the ability to successfully navigate this challenge in the years to come.   Ultimately preserving a healthy democracy requires constant vigilance and renewal. The MAGA movement serves as a stark reminder that even long-established democracies are not immune to authoritarian impulses. By understanding the nature of this threat Americans across the political spectrum can work to uphold the principles of democratic self-governance for future generations.,2024-07-13 14:30:23 GMT

Today as leader of a national immigrants‚Äô rights advocacy organization I am again horrified as Democrats ignore the lessons of that colossal moral and policy failure and double down on a misguided political strategy to outdo Republican extremism on immigration.  Democrats would be wise to avoid their past mistakes. Instead President Joe Biden and his Senate counterparts recently adopted Republicans‚Äô ‚Äútough on immigration‚Äù rhetoric in a failed bid to pass a sweeping border bill that would upend long-established asylum protections and resembles some of the worst government sanctioned cruelties we saw under former President Donald Trump.  Fortunately it was always clear this bill would fail a second time when Democrats put it up for a vote again in May. Still some of its worst provisions were implemented with President Biden‚Äôs subsequent asylum executive order. The long-term consequences of the Democratic Party embracing this cruel approach for political expediency could cause lasting damage for decades.  The Clinton-era crime bill‚Äîchampioned in Congress by then-Senator Joe Biden‚Äîshould offer Democrats a clear warning about legislating out of fear for a perceived political gain. Billed as an answer for a society grappling with addiction poverty and inequality it instead devastated Black and brown communities helping to drive mass incarceration with no significant reduction in crime. Thirty years after the bill‚Äôs passage policymakers across the political spectrum have disavowed the bill‚Äôs punitive approach. Many of these unlikely partners have become allies on many justice reform issues including Trump‚Äôs First Step Act.  Like the crime bill we know that the bipartisan border bill‚Äôs ‚Äútough‚Äù measures are not real solutions to our overwhelmed and severely outdated immigration system. We know this because the U.S. has already squandered billions of taxpayer dollars in the pursuit of deadly deterrence strategies and bolstering border enforcement. After decades of misdirecting investments into hardening the border including four dystopian years of chaos under Trump the data shows that this approach does not work.  While this border bill would not help solve our problems its consequences‚Äîeven of just propping it up with its accompanying anti-immigrant rhetoric‚Äîwill almost certainly fall disproportionately on Black and brown people. Democrats are once again showing that they are willing to sell out communities of color to look ‚Äútough.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs not forget that Biden and Democrats won in 2020 with the largest multiracial multigenerational coalition this country has ever seen. And yet just like in the ‚Äò90s Democrats are selling out this coalition trading perceived short-term gains for the long-term suffering of the very communities that mobilized to put them in power.  History will not be kind to such choices.,2024-07-13 13:44:02 GMT
22,Joe Biden,['politics'  'donald trump'  'potus'  'scotus'  'heritage foundation'  'trump'  'democracy'  'democrats'  'republicans'  'maga'  'maga morons'],ngdrb,The Growing Dangers of the MAGA Movement The ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù (MAGA) movement spearheaded by former President Donald Trump has become a prominent political force in the United States. While its supporters claim it champions patriotism and traditional American values the movement has increasingly been associated with extremist ideologies posing significant threats to American democracy social cohesion and national stability.  Core Beliefs and Goals At its core the MAGA movement promotes a narrow exclusionary vision of American identity rooted in nativism white Christian nationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment. It espouses a nostalgic longing for an idealized past when America was supposedly ‚Äúgreat‚Äù often interpreted as a time of unchallenged white Christian dominance. The movement‚Äôs rhetoric frequently portrays immigrants racial and religious minorities and progressive values as existential threats to this perceived traditional American way of life.  One of the movement‚Äôs central goals is to reshape the American political landscape by dismantling established norms institutions and checks and balances. This includes undermining the independence of the judiciary weakening the separation of powers and eroding the integrity of democratic processes such as free and fair elections. The movement has consistently sought to consolidate power and marginalize dissenting voices often through the perpetuation of conspiracy theories and the demonization of perceived enemies.  Ties to Extremist Ideologies While the MAGA movement claims to reject extremism its rhetoric and actions have increasingly aligned with far-right white nationalist and anti-democratic ideologies. The movement has provided a mainstream platform for individuals and groups that espouse hateful discriminatory and often violent beliefs.  The overlap between the MAGA movement and extremist groups has become increasingly apparent with many prominent figures within the movement embracing or failing to condemn racist xenophobic and anti-Semitic ideologies. This normalization of extremist ideologies has contributed to the mainstreaming of hate speech conspiracy theories and the vilification of marginalized communities.  Moreover the movement‚Äôs unwavering support for former President Trump even in the face of his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results has further solidified its ties to anti-democratic forces. The events of January 6th 2021 when MAGA supporters violently stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power highlighted the movement‚Äôs potential for inciting violence and undermining the foundations of American democracy.  Impact on American Democracy The MAGA movement‚Äôs assault on democratic norms and institutions poses grave threats to the integrity of American democracy. Its efforts to undermine the credibility of elections the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the press have eroded public trust in the very pillars that uphold the nation‚Äôs democratic system.  The movement‚Äôs embrace of conspiracy theories and disinformation has fueled a profound erosion of shared reality making it increasingly difficult to engage in constructive political discourse and find common ground. This polarization has paralyzed meaningful policymaking and exacerbated societal divisions hindering the nation‚Äôs ability to address pressing challenges effectively.  Furthermore the movement‚Äôs rhetoric and actions have contributed to a toxic political climate where dissent is often met with hostility intimidation and threats of violence. This chilling effect on free speech and open debate undermines the principles of a vibrant democracy and risks silencing legitimate voices and perspectives.  Threats to Social Cohesion and National Stability The MAGA movement‚Äôs divisive and exclusionary rhetoric has profound implications for social cohesion and national stability. Its vilification of marginalized communities and promotion of tribalism has fueled a resurgence of hate crimes discrimination and societal tensions eroding the nation‚Äôs diversity and unity.  The movement‚Äôs embrace of conspiracy theories and disinformation has also contributed to the erosion of trust in public institutions mainstream media and established sources of information. This has created an environment where misinformation and disinformation can thrive making it increasingly difficult to address complex societal challenges based on facts and evidence.  Moreover the movement‚Äôs glorification of violence and its resistance to peaceful transfers of power pose direct threats to national stability. The events of January 6th 2021 demonstrated the potential for the MAGA movement‚Äôs rhetoric and actions to incite civil unrest and undermine the foundations of the nation‚Äôs democratic system.  Conclusion The MAGA movement while purporting to champion patriotism and traditional American values has become increasingly associated with extremist ideologies anti-democratic tendencies and threats to social cohesion and national stability. Its narrow exclusionary vision of American identity promotion of conspiracy theories and embrace of divisive rhetoric have eroded democratic norms fueled societal tensions and undermined the nation‚Äôs ability to address pressing challenges effectively.  As the movement continues to gain momentum and influence it is imperative for all Americans to recognize the grave dangers it poses and to actively defend the principles of democracy pluralism and the rule of law. Failure to address the underlying issues that have given rise to the MAGA movement‚Äôs appeal and to counter its extremist tendencies risks further polarization civil unrest and the erosion of the democratic foundations that have sustained the United States for over two centuries.,2024-07-13 13:31:54 GMT

14,Joe Biden,['us politics'  'vote'],tiggymalvern,Nobody I know wanted Biden to run again. Nobody wanted a Biden-Trump rematch and all the polls said so a year ago or more. Biden should have declared two years ago that he would be a one term President the Dems should have held primaries for his replacement and we should have been bigging up our new candidate all this time. Chances are we would have got someone like Gavin Newsom.  But Biden didn‚Äôt. And now it is quite simply too late. There are four months left until the election. All the funds that Biden has been raising all this time for his campaign cannot simply be transferred to a new candidate. That would be illegal. There is not time for a new candidate to be chosen raise funds and run. It is impossible to win that way. So we‚Äôre stuck with Biden even if the chances of him winning are shrinking by the day.  There would barely be time to replace Biden with Kamala by default even if we announced that today and a lot of Dems dislike Kamala. Plus I have serious concerns that a large enough percentage of the American public simply will not vote for a woman for that to tip the balance. Even if only 2 or 3% of Independents are misogynistic enough for that to be a factor those are the margins this election will be won on. I honestly believe that was a factor in Hillary losing in 2016 along with the fact that people just didn‚Äôt like her. Kamala is also a woman who is not considered ‚Äòlikeable‚Äô.  Dems need to STOP calling for Biden to stand down. Anyone publicly stating that he needs to be replaced is just doing Trump‚Äôs work for him. We need to put up shut up hold our noses and vote for goddamn Biden even if he is going senile or has Parkinson‚Äôs. There are plans in place for that. This is why we have a Veep and an entire Presidential staff - because there are plans for a sick or dead President. There are no plans to stop an authoritarian President who has been given immunity in advance for anything he might do.,2024-07-13 14:40:57 GMT

What began as a catchy campaign slogan has evolved into a broad ideological movement with tens of millions of devoted adherents.   While supporters view it as a patriotic effort to restore traditional American values and strength critics see the MAGA movement as an existential threat to democracy pluralism and the rule of law in the United States. This essay will examine the origins and evolution of the MAGA movement analyze its core ideological tenets and tactics and explore the various ways in which it poses growing dangers to American democratic institutions and social cohesion.   By synthesizing research expert analysis and recent events we can better understand the nature of this movement and the challenges it presents.  Origins and Evolution of the MAGA Movement   The roots of the MAGA movement can be traced back to long-standing currents of populism nativism and anti-establishment sentiment in American politics. However it was Donald Trump who managed to coalesce these disparate threads into a potent political force during his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump‚Äôs promise to ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù resonated with millions of Americans who felt left behind by globalization demographic changes and shifting cultural norms.  His brash outsider persona and willingness to buck political correctness attracted those who were disillusioned with conventional politicians. Trump tapped into feelings of economic anxiety cultural displacement and resentment toward coastal elites to build a devoted base of support.   After his surprise victory in 2016 the MAGA slogan transformed from a campaign catchphrase into a full-fledged movement and identity. Trump supporters eagerly adopted the MAGA label proudly wearing red hats and using the hashtag online. The movement took on a life of its own with Trump as its figurehead but extending well beyond just one man.   Throughout Trump‚Äôs presidency the MAGA movement continued to evolve and radicalize. As Trump faced investigations impeachment proceedings and constant media scrutiny his base became increasingly defensive and hostile toward perceived enemies.   Conspiracy theories like QAnon found fertile ground among MAGA adherents. The movement adopted an increasingly apocalyptic and militant tone portraying itself as the last line of defense against sinister forces trying to destroy America.   The movement reached a crescendo - and a dangerous breaking point - on January 6 2021 when thousands of Trump supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. This event crystallized the growing extremism within the MAGA movement and its willingness to subvert democratic processes. Even after Trump left office the MAGA movement has endured as a powerful force in American politics. It has reshaped the Republican Party in Trump‚Äôs image and continues to exert enormous influence through primaries fundraising and setting the terms of political debate on the right.   Core Tenets and Ideology  While the MAGA movement encompasses a range of views several core ideological tenets have emerged as central to its worldview:  America First Nationalism: The movement advocates an ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù foreign and economic policy rejecting globalism in favor of national sovereignty and protectionism. Anti-immigration: Restricting both legal and illegal immigration is a top priority often couched in nativist rhetoric about preserving American culture. Cultural traditionalism: MAGA adherents push back against progressive social changes championing traditional gender roles religious values and a nostalgic view of America‚Äôs past. Deep state paranoia: The movement is deeply distrustful of government institutions mainstream media and other power centers believing them to be corrupt and working against the interests of everyday Americans. Cult of personality: Loyalty to Donald Trump personally is a defining feature with the movement portraying him as a messianic figure fighting dark forces. Anti-‚Äúwokeness‚Äù: The MAGA movement positions itself in staunch opposition to progressive ideas about systemic racism LGBTQ+ rights and other social justice causes. Election denialism: Following Trump‚Äôs lead much of the movement refuses to accept the legitimacy of the 2020 election results pushing baseless fraud claims. Conspiratorial thinking: The movement is prone to embracing and amplifying conspiracy theories that support its worldview from QAnon to COVID-19 misinformation. These ideological pillars form the foundation of the MAGA movement‚Äôs grievance-fueled politics and its antagonistic stance toward democratic institutions and norms.   Tactics and Strategies   The MAGA movement employs a range of tactics to advance its goals and expand its influence:  Social media mobilization: Savvy use of platforms like Twitter Facebook and newer alt-tech sites allows rapid dissemination of messaging and coordination of grassroots action. Alternative media ecosystem: A network of right-wing news outlets podcasts and influencers creates an insular information bubble for supporters. Intimidation and threats: Movement figures often use violent rhetoric and veiled threats to intimidate opponents and critics. Litigation and legal challenges: An army of pro-Trump lawyers file dubious lawsuits to challenge election results and other perceived slights. Primary challenges: The movement targets ‚Äúdisloyal‚Äù Republicans with primary opponents to enforce ideological conformity. Propaganda and disinformation: Coordinated campaigns spread misleading narratives and outright falsehoods to shape public opinion. Protests and rallies: Mass gatherings serve to energize the base and project a show of force. Infiltration of local offices: The movement has pushed supporters to take over low-level government positions like election boards and school boards. These tactics have proven effective at solidifying the movement‚Äôs power within the Republican Party and exerting outsized influence on the national political conversation.Growing Dangers to DemocracyThe MAGA movement poses several interconnected threats to the stability and functioning of American democracy:  Undermining faith in elections Perhaps the most immediate danger is the movement‚Äôs persistent efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of U.S. elections. By pushing baseless claims of widespread voter fraud and refusing to accept unfavorable results MAGA leaders are actively eroding public trust in the democratic process.This delegitimization of elections has several alarming consequences. It provides justification for new voting restrictions that disproportionately impact minority communities. It increases the risk of political violence as we saw on January 6th when MAGA supporters felt empowered to use force to ‚Äústop the steal.‚Äù And it creates a permission structure for future attempts to overturn legitimate election results.If a large segment of the population no longer believes in the basic mechanics of democracy it becomes nearly impossible to have peaceful transfers of power or to solve problems through normal political channels.  2.Assault on the rule of law  The MAGA movement has shown a troubling willingness to disregard the rule of law when it conflicts with their goals. This manifests in several ways:  Refusing to comply with lawful subpoenas and oversight efforts Pardoning political allies convicted of crimes Interfering in ongoing investigations for political purposes Calling for the imprisonment of political opponents without due process Flouting ethics rules and profiting from public office By treating the law as optional or applicable only to their enemies MAGA leaders set a dangerous precedent that threatens the foundations of constitutional governance.  3.Embracing political violence  While not universal among supporters there is a strong current of militancy within the MAGA movement that views violence as a legitimate political tool. This mindset has led to increased threats against public officials journalists and even fellow Republicans deemed insufficiently loyal.The events of January 6th represented a shocking escalation demonstrating that a significant portion of the movement is willing to use force to achieve its ends. Even more concerning is the way many MAGA leaders have subsequently downplayed or justified the Capitol attack.This normalization of political violence profoundly destabilizes democracy and makes peaceful resolution of differences far more difficult  4.Undermining truth and shared reality  The MAGA movement‚Äôs loose relationship with factual reality represents another serious threat to functional democracy. By embracing conspiracy theories rejecting scientific expertise and creating alternative information ecosystems the movement erodes the possibility of having good-faith debates based on a shared set of facts.When a large segment of the population lives in a completely different epistemic reality it becomes nearly impossible to find common ground or craft effective policy solutions. This rejection of truth and expertise also leaves followers vulnerable to manipulation and extreme ideas.  5.Weakening of democratic institutions  MAGA leaders have waged a sustained assault on the legitimacy of key democratic institutions like the justice system intelligence agencies the press and career civil servants. By portraying these entities as part of a nefarious ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù working against the people the movement weakens public trust in the very institutions needed for democracy to function.This institutional erosion creates a vicious cycle as weakened institutions are less able to serve as a check on abuses of power leading to further deterioration.6.  Personality cult dynamics  The MAGA movement‚Äôs intense devotion to Donald Trump personally introduces instability and irrationality into the political system. When loyalty to an individual trumps commitment to principles or the national interest it opens the door to significant abuses of power.The personalization of politics around Trump also makes it more difficult to resolve political differences through normal democratic means. Policy debates get reduced to whether one supports or opposes Trump as an individual.  7.Minority rule tendencies  There are strong anti-democratic currents within the MAGA movement that seek to entrench minority rule through a variety of mechanisms:  Extreme gerrymandering Voter suppression targeting Democratic-leaning groups Exploiting the electoral college and Senate‚Äôs rural bias Court packing to lock in a conservative judiciary Calls to repeal the 17th Amendment (direct election of Senators) These efforts to insulate MAGA power from the will of the majority represent a fundamental threat to the principle of popular sovereignty.  8.Scapegoating and demonitiization  The MAGA movement‚Äôs rhetoric often seeks to divide Americans into ‚Äúreal‚Äù patriots versus dangerous ‚Äúothers‚Äù - whether immigrants racial minorities liberals or the nebulous ‚Äúelite.‚Äù This deliberate ‚Äúus vs. them‚Äù framing corrodes social cohesion and paints political opponents as existential enemies rather than fellow citizens with differing views.Taken to extremes this dehumanization of the opposition can be used to justify anti-democratic actions or even violence in the name of defending the ‚Äúreal America.  Potential Future Trajectories  Looking ahead there are several potential paths the MAGA movement could take each with significant implications for American democracy:  Moderation and reintegration: In this optimistic scenario the movement gradually moderates its views and tactics allowing for its reintegration into normal democratic politics. This would likely require new leadership and a rejection of its most extreme elements. Continued radicalization: The movement could continue down the path of escalating extremism embracing more conspiratorial thinking and explicit calls for anti-democratic action. This risks further political violence and democratic backsliding. Splintering: Internal divisions could cause the movement to fragment into competing factions potentially diminishing its overall influence but also creating space for even more radical offshoots. Institutional capture: The movement could succeed in taking over the Republican Party entirely and gaining control of key government institutions allowing for the implementation of its agenda through official channels. Authoritarian takeover: In a worst-case scenario MAGA leaders could leverage a crisis or electoral victory to rapidly dismantle democratic guardrails and institute authoritarian rule similar to what has occurred in countries like Hungary. The trajectory the movement takes will depend on a variety of factors including the actions of MAGA leaders the response of democratic institutions economic conditions and unforeseen events that could reshape the political landscape. Responding to the Threat Given the serious dangers posed by the MAGA movement a robust democratic response is necessary. Some potential strategies include:  Strengthening democratic institutions: Shoring up the integrity and independence of bodies like the Justice Department election administration and civil service to withstand political pressure. Civic education: Improving public understanding of democratic processes and values to build resilience against anti-democratic messaging. Media literacy: Equipping citizens with the tools to critically evaluate information sources and resist disinformation. Bipartisan coalition building: Forging alliances between Democrats and non-MAGA Republicans to present a united front in defense of democratic norms. Economic policy: Addressing the legitimate economic grievances that fuel support for the movement through inclusive growth policies. Legal accountability: Ensuring that violations of law and democratic norms face appropriate consequences regardless of political affiliation. Depolarization efforts: Investing in initiatives that bridge partisan divides and rebuild social cohesion at the community level. Election reform: Implementing reforms to increase faith in election integrity while expanding access to voting. Countering extremism: Providing off-ramps and support for those at risk of radicalization into anti-democratic ideologies. Conclusion  The MAGA movement represents one of the most significant challenges to American democracy in generations. Its potent mix of grievance politics personality cult dynamics and anti-democratic tendencies poses a multifaceted threat to the stability and functioning of the country‚Äôs political system.  While the movement taps into some legitimate frustrations with the status quo its proposed solutions and tactics risk undermining the very foundations of constitutional governance. The normalization of political violence erosion of truth and delegitimization of democratic institutions create a volatile situation with the potential for severe instability.   Responding effectively to this threat will require a clear-eyed understanding of the movement‚Äôs appeal and tactics coupled with proactive efforts to strengthen democratic guardrails and rebuild civic cohesion. The future of American democracy may well hinge on the ability to successfully navigate this challenge in the years to come.   Ultimately preserving a healthy democracy requires constant vigilance and renewal. The MAGA movement serves as a stark reminder that even long-established democracies are not immune to authoritarian impulses. By understanding the nature of this threat Americans across the political spectrum can work to uphold the principles of democratic self-governance for future generations.,2024-07-13 14:30:23 GMT

Today as leader of a national immigrants‚Äô rights advocacy organization I am again horrified as Democrats ignore the lessons of that colossal moral and policy failure and double down on a misguided political strategy to outdo Republican extremism on immigration.  Democrats would be wise to avoid their past mistakes. Instead President Joe Biden and his Senate counterparts recently adopted Republicans‚Äô ‚Äútough on immigration‚Äù rhetoric in a failed bid to pass a sweeping border bill that would upend long-established asylum protections and resembles some of the worst government sanctioned cruelties we saw under former President Donald Trump.  Fortunately it was always clear this bill would fail a second time when Democrats put it up for a vote again in May. Still some of its worst provisions were implemented with President Biden‚Äôs subsequent asylum executive order. The long-term consequences of the Democratic Party embracing this cruel approach for political expediency could cause lasting damage for decades.  The Clinton-era crime bill‚Äîchampioned in Congress by then-Senator Joe Biden‚Äîshould offer Democrats a clear warning about legislating out of fear for a perceived political gain. Billed as an answer for a society grappling with addiction poverty and inequality it instead devastated Black and brown communities helping to drive mass incarceration with no significant reduction in crime. Thirty years after the bill‚Äôs passage policymakers across the political spectrum have disavowed the bill‚Äôs punitive approach. Many of these unlikely partners have become allies on many justice reform issues including Trump‚Äôs First Step Act.  Like the crime bill we know that the bipartisan border bill‚Äôs ‚Äútough‚Äù measures are not real solutions to our overwhelmed and severely outdated immigration system. We know this because the U.S. has already squandered billions of taxpayer dollars in the pursuit of deadly deterrence strategies and bolstering border enforcement. After decades of misdirecting investments into hardening the border including four dystopian years of chaos under Trump the data shows that this approach does not work.  While this border bill would not help solve our problems its consequences‚Äîeven of just propping it up with its accompanying anti-immigrant rhetoric‚Äîwill almost certainly fall disproportionately on Black and brown people. Democrats are once again showing that they are willing to sell out communities of color to look ‚Äútough.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs not forget that Biden and Democrats won in 2020 with the largest multiracial multigenerational coalition this country has ever seen. And yet just like in the ‚Äò90s Democrats are selling out this coalition trading perceived short-term gains for the long-term suffering of the very communities that mobilized to put them in power.  History will not be kind to such choices.,2024-07-13 13:44:02 GMT

Throughout his presidency President Biden has pursued an ambitious agenda aimed at addressing these pressing issues and advancing key policy priorities. In this essay we will examine some of the notable accomplishments of Joe Biden during his time in office and the impact of his leadership on the nation.  One of the most significant accomplishments of President Biden during his presidency has been his administration‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon taking office President Biden made the pandemic a top priority and swiftly implemented a national strategy to combat the spread of the virus and accelerate the vaccination campaign.  Under his leadership the administration successfully exceeded its initial goal of administering 100 million vaccine doses within the first 100 days ultimately surpassing 200 million doses. This aggressive vaccination effort has been instrumental in curbing the spread of the virus and has contributed to a significant reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths across the country.    In addition to his focus on public health President Biden has made substantial strides in revitalizing the American economy in the wake of the pandemic. The administration‚Äôs American Rescue Plan a comprehensive COVID-19 relief package provided much-needed financial assistance to individuals families and businesses impacted by the economic downturn. The plan included direct stimulus payments to Americans extended unemployment benefits support for small businesses and funding for vaccine distribution and testing.   President Biden‚Äôs economic agenda has also centered on job creation and infrastructure investment culminating in the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law a historic legislation that allocates substantial funding for modernizing the nation‚Äôs infrastructure creating millions of jobs and bolstering economic growth. Furthermore President Biden has been a vocal advocate for advancing racial equity and social justice in the United States. His administration has taken concrete steps to address systemic inequalities and promote inclusivity including the signing of executive orders to combat discrimination promote fair housing and strengthen tribal sovereignty.   Additionally President Biden signed into law the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act establishing Juneteenth as a federal holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the United States. These actions underscore the administration‚Äôs commitment to confronting the legacy of racism and fostering a more equitable society for all Americans.    Moreover President Biden has demonstrated a strong commitment to combating climate change and advancing environmental sustainability.    His administration rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change signaling a renewed dedication to global cooperation in addressing the climate crisis. In November 2021 President Biden convened a virtual Leaders Summit on Climate bringing together world leaders to discuss ambitious measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the transition to clean energy.   Additionally the administration has unveiled a comprehensive plan to invest in clean energy infrastructure promote energy efficiency and prioritize environmental justice aiming to position the United States as a global leader in the fight against climate change.   In the realm of foreign policy President Biden has sought to reassert American leadership on the world stage and rebuild alliances with international partners. His administration has prioritized diplomacy and multilateral engagement working to address global challenges such as nuclear proliferation cybersecurity threats and human rights abuses.   President Biden has reaffirmed the United States‚Äô commitment to NATO and other key alliances signaling a departure from the isolationist policies of the previous administration. His approach to foreign affairs has emphasized the importance of collaboration and collective action in tackling shared global concerns fostering a more cohesive and cooperative international order. Furthermore   President Biden has been a steadfast proponent of expanding access to affordable healthcare and strengthening the Affordable Care Act. His administration has taken steps to bolster the ACA including increasing enrollment outreach expanding coverage options and lowering healthcare costs for millions of Americans.   President Biden has also championed efforts to address mental health challenges and substance abuse disorders recognizing the critical importance of mental and behavioral health in overall well-being.   In conclusion President Joe Biden has achieved a range of significant accomplishments during his tenure in office from his swift and effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic to his ambitious efforts to revitalize the economy promote racial equity combat climate change and reinvigorate America‚Äôs role in global affairs.   His leadership has been marked by a steadfast commitment to addressing pressing domestic and international challenges and advancing a progressive policy agenda aimed at fostering a more equitable resilient and prosperous future for the nation.

14,Joe Biden,['us politics'  'vote'],tiggymalvern,Nobody I know wanted Biden to run again. Nobody wanted a Biden-Trump rematch and all the polls said so a year ago or more. Biden should have declared two years ago that he would be a one term President the Dems should have held primaries for his replacement and we should have been bigging up our new candidate all this time. Chances are we would have got someone like Gavin Newsom.  But Biden didn‚Äôt. And now it is quite simply too late. There are four months left until the election. All the funds that Biden has been raising all this time for his campaign cannot simply be transferred to a new candidate. That would be illegal. There is not time for a new candidate to be chosen raise funds and run. It is impossible to win that way. So we‚Äôre stuck with Biden even if the chances of him winning are shrinking by the day.  There would barely be time to replace Biden with Kamala by default even if we announced that today and a lot of Dems dislike Kamala. Plus I have serious concerns that a large enough percentage of the American public simply will not vote for a woman for that to tip the balance. Even if only 2 or 3% of Independents are misogynistic enough for that to be a factor those are the margins this election will be won on. I honestly believe that was a factor in Hillary losing in 2016 along with the fact that people just didn‚Äôt like her. Kamala is also a woman who is not considered ‚Äòlikeable‚Äô.  Dems need to STOP calling for Biden to stand down. Anyone publicly stating that he needs to be replaced is just doing Trump‚Äôs work for him. We need to put up shut up hold our noses and vote for goddamn Biden even if he is going senile or has Parkinson‚Äôs. There are plans in place for that. This is why we have a Veep and an entire Presidential staff - because there are plans for a sick or dead President. There are no plans to stop an authoritarian President who has been given immunity in advance for anything he might do.,2024-07-13 14:40:57 GMT

And as a physician writing on The Times‚Äô op-ed page makes clear the Biden administration isn‚Äôt helping.  The numbers of new infections and hospital admissions are sobering: Wastewater data indicate that the JN.1 variant of COVID-19 is infecting about 2 million Americans every day making this surge second in prevalence only to the Omicron wave that hit in 2021 and 2022. Thanks to vaccines the Omicron peak was less deadly than the wave that hit in late 2020 and early 2021 when mask mandates and social distancing were still our primary weapons against COVID-19 and inoculation was only beginning.  Even though the Omicron wave for most people marks the beginning of the ‚Äúliving with this disease‚Äù phase of COVID ‚Äî where we forgo mitigation and accept the risks of infection by a survivable virus ‚Äî large groups of people fared worse than ever. You know who did really poorly? Cancer patients who died at a higher rate than during any previous surge. With compromised immune systems they benefit more from mitigation measures such as masking than vaccination but by the time Omicron rolled around many of us had grown tired of covering our faces and keeping our distance.  For most people the price of an Omicron infection was mild illness and possibly long COVID; for cancer patients it was a higher likelihood of dying.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; As for long COVID ‚Äî when crippling symptoms persist for months or even years after infection ‚Äî it‚Äôs hard to quantify the price to society from millions of people walking around with brain fog and fatigue for interminable periods not to mention the increased risk of heart disease and stroke long after infection. Deciding to live with COVID doesn‚Äôt mean any of this goes away if by ‚Äúliving with COVID‚Äù you mean refusing to wear a high-quality mask.  Writing on our op-ed page Dr. Eric J. Topol ‚Äî whose work communicating the risks of unfettered virus circulation I consider indispensable ‚Äî reminds us of the damage this JN.1 surge does to people without fully functioning immune systems and the need of the government to continue developing vaccines that deliver better protection from COVID variants. He ends his piece appropriately by criticizing the Biden administration‚Äôs complacency:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crickets from the White House on COVID now with no messaging on getting the updated booster or masking. The Biden administration has done far too little to accelerate research on effective treatments for long COVID.  ‚ÄúThis passivity reinforces the illusion that the pandemic is behind us when it‚Äôs actually raging. And this season will be followed by a more quiescent period which will once again lull us into thinking the pandemic is over. But there is no getting over it until we recognize reality and double down on the research that will allow us to block infections and virus spread and achieve lasting variant-proof immunity.‚Äù     As we head towards this year‚Äôs election remember just how much pain and suffering Biden‚Äôs inaction on covid has caused and continues to cause. There are several candidates running whose covid policy is light years away from Biden‚Äôs. Vote for what you believe in not out of fear. Do everything you can to make a better future instead of stifling better for maybe perhaps kinda not as bad (for you personally based on vibes).,2024-07-13 18:57:53 GMT

Let‚Äôs break down the details for better understanding.‚Äù  The Republican Party in the United States is facing significant intellectual challenges particularly from within its ranks. The rise of the so-called ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù (Make America Great Again) movement spearheaded by former President Donald Trump and his ardent supporters has brought to the forefront a concerning trend of anti-intellectualism conspiracy theories and a disregard for empirical evidence.  The MAGA Movement: A Departure from Reason  The MAGA movement which has gained a strong foothold within the Republican Party represents a departure from traditional conservative principles rooted in reason logic and intellectual discourse. Instead it has embraced a brand of populism that often rejects expertise dismisses inconvenient facts and promotes a cult-like devotion to its figurehead Donald Trump.  Prominent MAGA supporters such as Marjorie Taylor Greene Donald Trump Jr. J.D. Vance Ron Johnson Lauren Boebert Matt Gaetz Elise Stefanik Scott Perry Kari Lake Greg Abbott and Ted Cruz have been at the forefront of propagating conspiracy theories spreading disinformation and undermining faith in democratic institutions.  The Denial of Reality  One of the most concerning aspects of the MAGA movement is its blatant denial of reality and its dismissal of empirical evidence. The refusal to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election despite overwhelming evidence of its legitimacy is a prime example of this dangerous trend.  Members of the MAGA movement have perpetuated the baseless claim of widespread voter fraud even in the face of numerous court rulings audits and investigations that have found no evidence to support their allegations. This willful disregard for facts and the rule of law undermines the very foundations of American democracy.  The Erosion of Intellectual Discourse  The MAGA movement has also contributed to the erosion of intellectual discourse within the Republican Party. Instead of engaging in substantive debates and reasoned arguments its adherents often resort to ad hominem attacks whataboutism and the demonization of those who dare to challenge their beliefs.  This hostility towards intellectual rigor and critical thinking has alienated many conservative thinkers and academicians further exacerbating the party‚Äôs intellectual challenges. The result is a political environment where emotionally charged rhetoric and conspiracy theories take precedence over evidence-based policymaking and rational debate  Threats to Social Cohesion and National Stability  The intellectual challenges within the Republican Party fueled by the MAGA movement pose significant threats to social cohesion and national stability. The promotion of divisive rhetoric the demonization of perceived ‚Äúenemies‚Äù and the rejection of established facts and institutions can lead to a further polarization of society and a breakdown of shared values and trust in democratic processes.  Moreover the embrace of conspiracy theories and the normalization of disinformation can erode the foundations of an informed citizenry which is essential for the proper functioning of a democratic society. When truth and reality are subjugated to partisan interests and personal agendas the ability to engage in constructive dialogue and find common ground becomes increasingly difficult.  The Way Forward: Embracing Intellectual Integrity  To address these intellectual challenges the Republican Party must recommit itself to the principles of reason evidence-based policymaking and respect for democratic institutions. This requires a willingness to reject conspiracy theories disinformation and the demonization of political opponents.  Additionally the party must foster an environment that values intellectual discourse welcomes diverse perspectives and encourages critical thinking. This means embracing dissenting voices engaging in substantive debates and rejecting the notion that loyalty to a particular individual or ideology supersedes the pursuit of truth and the common good.  Ultimately the path forward for the Republican Party lies in reclaiming its intellectual integrity and recommitting itself to the principles of reason evidence and democratic values. Only by doing so can it address the contemporary intellectual challenges it faces and restore its credibility as a party of serious thinkers and policymakers.,2024-07-13 19:48:58 GMT

And as a physician writing on The Times‚Äô op-ed page makes clear the Biden administration isn‚Äôt helping.  The numbers of new infections and hospital admissions are sobering: Wastewater data indicate that the JN.1 variant of COVID-19 is infecting about 2 million Americans every day making this surge second in prevalence only to the Omicron wave that hit in 2021 and 2022. Thanks to vaccines the Omicron peak was less deadly than the wave that hit in late 2020 and early 2021 when mask mandates and social distancing were still our primary weapons against COVID-19 and inoculation was only beginning.  Even though the Omicron wave for most people marks the beginning of the ‚Äúliving with this disease‚Äù phase of COVID ‚Äî where we forgo mitigation and accept the risks of infection by a survivable virus ‚Äî large groups of people fared worse than ever. You know who did really poorly? Cancer patients who died at a higher rate than during any previous surge. With compromised immune systems they benefit more from mitigation measures such as masking than vaccination but by the time Omicron rolled around many of us had grown tired of covering our faces and keeping our distance.  For most people the price of an Omicron infection was mild illness and possibly long COVID; for cancer patients it was a higher likelihood of dying.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; As for long COVID ‚Äî when crippling symptoms persist for months or even years after infection ‚Äî it‚Äôs hard to quantify the price to society from millions of people walking around with brain fog and fatigue for interminable periods not to mention the increased risk of heart disease and stroke long after infection. Deciding to live with COVID doesn‚Äôt mean any of this goes away if by ‚Äúliving with COVID‚Äù you mean refusing to wear a high-quality mask.  Writing on our op-ed page Dr. Eric J. Topol ‚Äî whose work communicating the risks of unfettered virus circulation I consider indispensable ‚Äî reminds us of the damage this JN.1 surge does to people without fully functioning immune systems and the need of the government to continue developing vaccines that deliver better protection from COVID variants. He ends his piece appropriately by criticizing the Biden administration‚Äôs complacency:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crickets from the White House on COVID now with no messaging on getting the updated booster or masking. The Biden administration has done far too little to accelerate research on effective treatments for long COVID.  ‚ÄúThis passivity reinforces the illusion that the pandemic is behind us when it‚Äôs actually raging. And this season will be followed by a more quiescent period which will once again lull us into thinking the pandemic is over. But there is no getting over it until we recognize reality and double down on the research that will allow us to block infections and virus spread and achieve lasting variant-proof immunity.‚Äù     As we head towards this year‚Äôs election remember just how much pain and suffering Biden‚Äôs inaction on covid has caused and continues to cause. There are several candidates running whose covid policy is light years away from Biden‚Äôs. Vote for what you believe in not out of fear. Do everything you can to make a better future instead of stifling better for maybe perhaps kinda not as bad (for you personally based on vibes).,2024-07-13 18:57:53 GMT

Members of the MAGA movement have perpetuated the baseless claim of widespread voter fraud even in the face of numerous court rulings audits and investigations that have found no evidence to support their allegations. This willful disregard for facts and the rule of law undermines the very foundations of American democracy.  The Erosion of Intellectual Discourse  The MAGA movement has also contributed to the erosion of intellectual discourse within the Republican Party. Instead of engaging in substantive debates and reasoned arguments its adherents often resort to ad hominem attacks whataboutism and the demonization of those who dare to challenge their beliefs.  This hostility towards intellectual rigor and critical thinking has alienated many conservative thinkers and academicians further exacerbating the party‚Äôs intellectual challenges. The result is a political environment where emotionally charged rhetoric and conspiracy theories take precedence over evidence-based policymaking and rational debate  Threats to Social Cohesion and National Stability  The intellectual challenges within the Republican Party fueled by the MAGA movement pose significant threats to social cohesion and national stability. The promotion of divisive rhetoric the demonization of perceived ‚Äúenemies‚Äù and the rejection of established facts and institutions can lead to a further polarization of society and a breakdown of shared values and trust in democratic processes.  Moreover the embrace of conspiracy theories and the normalization of disinformation can erode the foundations of an informed citizenry which is essential for the proper functioning of a democratic society. When truth and reality are subjugated to partisan interests and personal agendas the ability to engage in constructive dialogue and find common ground becomes increasingly difficult.  The Way Forward: Embracing Intellectual Integrity  To address these intellectual challenges the Republican Party must recommit itself to the principles of reason evidence-based policymaking and respect for democratic institutions. This requires a willingness to reject conspiracy theories disinformation and the demonization of political opponents.  Additionally the party must foster an environment that values intellectual discourse welcomes diverse perspectives and encourages critical thinking. This means embracing dissenting voices engaging in substantive debates and rejecting the notion that loyalty to a particular individual or ideology supersedes the pursuit of truth and the common good.  Ultimately the path forward for the Republican Party lies in reclaiming its intellectual integrity and recommitting itself to the principles of reason evidence and democratic values. Only by doing so can it address the contemporary intellectual challenges it faces and restore its credibility as a party of serious thinkers and policymakers.,2024-07-13 19:48:58 GMT

And as a physician writing on The Times‚Äô op-ed page makes clear the Biden administration isn‚Äôt helping.  The numbers of new infections and hospital admissions are sobering: Wastewater data indicate that the JN.1 variant of COVID-19 is infecting about 2 million Americans every day making this surge second in prevalence only to the Omicron wave that hit in 2021 and 2022. Thanks to vaccines the Omicron peak was less deadly than the wave that hit in late 2020 and early 2021 when mask mandates and social distancing were still our primary weapons against COVID-19 and inoculation was only beginning.  Even though the Omicron wave for most people marks the beginning of the ‚Äúliving with this disease‚Äù phase of COVID ‚Äî where we forgo mitigation and accept the risks of infection by a survivable virus ‚Äî large groups of people fared worse than ever. You know who did really poorly? Cancer patients who died at a higher rate than during any previous surge. With compromised immune systems they benefit more from mitigation measures such as masking than vaccination but by the time Omicron rolled around many of us had grown tired of covering our faces and keeping our distance.  For most people the price of an Omicron infection was mild illness and possibly long COVID; for cancer patients it was a higher likelihood of dying.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; As for long COVID ‚Äî when crippling symptoms persist for months or even years after infection ‚Äî it‚Äôs hard to quantify the price to society from millions of people walking around with brain fog and fatigue for interminable periods not to mention the increased risk of heart disease and stroke long after infection. Deciding to live with COVID doesn‚Äôt mean any of this goes away if by ‚Äúliving with COVID‚Äù you mean refusing to wear a high-quality mask.  Writing on our op-ed page Dr. Eric J. Topol ‚Äî whose work communicating the risks of unfettered virus circulation I consider indispensable ‚Äî reminds us of the damage this JN.1 surge does to people without fully functioning immune systems and the need of the government to continue developing vaccines that deliver better protection from COVID variants. He ends his piece appropriately by criticizing the Biden administration‚Äôs complacency:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crickets from the White House on COVID now with no messaging on getting the updated booster or masking. The Biden administration has done far too little to accelerate research on effective treatments for long COVID.  ‚ÄúThis passivity reinforces the illusion that the pandemic is behind us when it‚Äôs actually raging. And this season will be followed by a more quiescent period which will once again lull us into thinking the pandemic is over. But there is no getting over it until we recognize reality and double down on the research that will allow us to block infections and virus spread and achieve lasting variant-proof immunity.‚Äù     As we head towards this year‚Äôs election remember just how much pain and suffering Biden‚Äôs inaction on covid has caused and continues to cause. There are several candidates running whose covid policy is light years away from Biden‚Äôs. Vote for what you believe in not out of fear.

The rise of the so-called ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù (Make America Great Again) movement spearheaded by former President Donald Trump and his ardent supporters has brought to the forefront a concerning trend of anti-intellectualism conspiracy theories and a disregard for empirical evidence.  The MAGA Movement: A Departure from Reason  The MAGA movement which has gained a strong foothold within the Republican Party represents a departure from traditional conservative principles rooted in reason logic and intellectual discourse. Instead it has embraced a brand of populism that often rejects expertise dismisses inconvenient facts and promotes a cult-like devotion to its figurehead Donald Trump.  Prominent MAGA supporters such as Marjorie Taylor Greene Donald Trump Jr. J.D.

Let‚Äôs break down the details for better understanding.‚Äù  The Republican Party in the United States is facing significant intellectual challenges particularly from within its ranks. The rise of the so-called ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù (Make America Great Again) movement spearheaded by former President Donald Trump and his ardent supporters has brought to the forefront a concerning trend of anti-intellectualism conspiracy theories and a disregard for empirical evidence.  The MAGA Movement: A Departure from Reason  The MAGA movement which has gained a strong foothold within the Republican Party represents a departure from traditional conservative principles rooted in reason logic and intellectual discourse. Instead it has embraced a brand of populism that often rejects expertise dismisses inconvenient facts and promotes a cult-like devotion to its figurehead Donald Trump.  Prominent MAGA supporters such as Marjorie Taylor Greene Donald Trump Jr. J.D. Vance Ron Johnson Lauren Boebert Matt Gaetz Elise Stefanik Scott Perry Kari Lake Greg Abbott and Ted Cruz have been at the forefront of propagating conspiracy theories spreading disinformation and undermining faith in democratic institutions.  The Denial of Reality  One of the most concerning aspects of the MAGA movement is its blatant denial of reality and its dismissal of empirical evidence. The refusal to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election despite overwhelming evidence of its legitimacy is a prime example of this dangerous trend.  Members of the MAGA movement have perpetuated the baseless claim of widespread voter fraud even in the face of numerous court rulings audits and investigations that have found no evidence to support their allegations. This willful disregard for facts and the rule of law undermines the very foundations of American democracy.  The Erosion of Intellectual Discourse  The MAGA movement has also contributed to the erosion of intellectual discourse within the Republican Party. Instead of engaging in substantive debates and reasoned arguments its adherents often resort to ad hominem attacks whataboutism and the demonization of those who dare to challenge their beliefs.  This hostility towards intellectual rigor and critical thinking has alienated many conservative thinkers and academicians further exacerbating the party‚Äôs intellectual challenges. The result is a political environment where emotionally charged rhetoric and conspiracy theories take precedence over evidence-based policymaking and rational debate  Threats to Social Cohesion and National Stability  The intellectual challenges within the Republican Party fueled by the MAGA movement pose significant threats to social cohesion and national stability. The promotion of divisive rhetoric the demonization of perceived ‚Äúenemies‚Äù and the rejection of established facts and institutions can lead to a further polarization of society and a breakdown of shared values and trust in democratic processes.  Moreover the embrace of conspiracy theories and the normalization of disinformation can erode the foundations of an informed citizenry which is essential for the proper functioning of a democratic society. When truth and reality are subjugated to partisan interests and personal agendas the ability to engage in constructive dialogue and find common ground becomes increasingly difficult.  The Way Forward: Embracing Intellectual Integrity  To address these intellectual challenges the Republican Party must recommit itself to the principles of reason evidence-based policymaking and respect for democratic institutions. This requires a willingness to reject conspiracy theories disinformation and the demonization of political opponents.  Additionally the party must foster an environment that values intellectual discourse welcomes diverse perspectives and encourages critical thinking. This means embracing dissenting voices engaging in substantive debates and rejecting the notion that loyalty to a particular individual or ideology supersedes the pursuit of truth and the common good.  Ultimately the path forward for the Republican Party lies in reclaiming its intellectual integrity and recommitting itself to the principles of reason evidence and democratic values. Only by doing so can it address the contemporary intellectual challenges it faces and restore its credibility as a party of serious thinkers and policymakers.,2024-07-13 19:48:58 GMT

And as a physician writing on The Times‚Äô op-ed page makes clear the Biden administration isn‚Äôt helping.  The numbers of new infections and hospital admissions are sobering: Wastewater data indicate that the JN.1 variant of COVID-19 is infecting about 2 million Americans every day making this surge second in prevalence only to the Omicron wave that hit in 2021 and 2022. Thanks to vaccines the Omicron peak was less deadly than the wave that hit in late 2020 and early 2021 when mask mandates and social distancing were still our primary weapons against COVID-19 and inoculation was only beginning.  Even though the Omicron wave for most people marks the beginning of the ‚Äúliving with this disease‚Äù phase of COVID ‚Äî where we forgo mitigation and accept the risks of infection by a survivable virus ‚Äî large groups of people fared worse than ever. You know who did really poorly? Cancer patients who died at a higher rate than during any previous surge. With compromised immune systems they benefit more from mitigation measures such as masking than vaccination but by the time Omicron rolled around many of us had grown tired of covering our faces and keeping our distance.  For most people the price of an Omicron infection was mild illness and possibly long COVID; for cancer patients it was a higher likelihood of dying.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; As for long COVID ‚Äî when crippling symptoms persist for months or even years after infection ‚Äî it‚Äôs hard to quantify the price to society from millions of people walking around with brain fog and fatigue for interminable periods not to mention the increased risk of heart disease and stroke long after infection. Deciding to live with COVID doesn‚Äôt mean any of this goes away if by ‚Äúliving with COVID‚Äù you mean refusing to wear a high-quality mask.  Writing on our op-ed page Dr. Eric J. Topol ‚Äî whose work communicating the risks of unfettered virus circulation I consider indispensable ‚Äî reminds us of the damage this JN.1 surge does to people without fully functioning immune systems and the need of the government to continue developing vaccines that deliver better protection from COVID variants. He ends his piece appropriately by criticizing the Biden administration‚Äôs complacency:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crickets from the White House on COVID now with no messaging on getting the updated booster or masking. The Biden administration has done far too little to accelerate research on effective treatments for long COVID.  ‚ÄúThis passivity reinforces the illusion that the pandemic is behind us when it‚Äôs actually raging. And this season will be followed by a more quiescent period which will once again lull us into thinking the pandemic is over. But there is no getting over it until we recognize reality and double down on the research that will allow us to block infections and virus spread and achieve lasting variant-proof immunity.‚Äù     As we head towards this year‚Äôs election remember just how much pain and suffering Biden‚Äôs inaction on covid has caused and continues to cause. There are several candidates running whose covid policy is light years away from Biden‚Äôs. Vote for what you believe in not out of fear. Do everything you can to make a better future instead of stifling better for maybe perhaps kinda not as bad (for you personally based on vibes).,2024-07-13 18:57:53 GMT

Do you think Trump won‚Äôt do the same? Do you think Trump won‚Äôt do worse?   ‚ÄúVote for a third party they‚Äôre both awful‚Äù you might say. Come on be realistic. This is about holding the line against fascism. It is going to be way WAY easier to change the system when you‚Äôre up against milk toast Joe than an actual dictator.

This event will do two things for the election. One it will galvanize Trump supporters and make him more sympathetic to moderates. Two it will make liberals less likely to vote and moderates harder on liberal candidates.  I hope that we don‚Äôt see Trump in office again but I am now afraid in a way I wasn‚Äôt several hours ago. If Trump gets re-elected the people who will be most hurt are going to be BIPOC Queer Immigrant Religious Minorities Disabled and importantly both Ukranians and Palestinians.   If you are part of any of these groups I urge you to find support networks to help you survive however that might look. If you aren‚Äôt a US American please encourage your political bodies to pressure the US government to maintain and improve on human rights and environmental protections as well as being willing to get targeted groups and people ojt of the US if it becomes necessary.  If you are a US American please vote and encourage everyone else to vote as well. Push your representatives to become more active in supporting protections for marginalized groups the environment and protection for Palestinians and Ukraine.  Importantly don‚Äôt lose hope. It is dark I will not lie or obfuscate on that but do not let your fear make you inactive.

Edit 2: the same stands for Harris. While I feel she is a better candidate than Biden I still hold the same criticisms of her positions on Israel and Palestine in spite of her acknowledgment of the carnage.

0,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'donaldtrump'],intriguingpeoplebyangelafloyd,DONALD TRUMP  DONALD TRUMP  July 2024  I woke up this morning to hear about the assassination attempt against Donald Trump and the death of Richard Simmons. I‚Äôm upset that we lost Richard Simmons because I had so much admiration of him.  Trump was shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania the bullet hit his ear which would have caused a shit load of pain but he survived. The perpetrator is no longer with us thankfully. Sad news is an innocent bystander was killed.  Joe Biden has come out to say that he is against the assassination attempt against Trump and he said that he is ‚Äòsick of violence‚Äô. Biden is pretty decent to come out and be supportive of Trump after the assassination attempt whether it‚Äôs for political reasons or not.  America is a violent country and there‚Äôs definitely a gun problem in the US. Abraham Lincoln and JFK were both killed from assassination attempts and Robert Reagan was also a target of an assassination attempt - he survived.  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you like someone or not the whole gun culture in American is a problem. Too many people getting killed especially children. Hopefully this incident will change Trump‚Äôs mind about gun control. Barack Obama served two terms as President but did very little when it came to gun control and the problem still persists. If Obama didn‚Äôt do anything about gun control I highly doubt Trump or Biden will have the balls (or the common sense) to do something about it.  Biden is elderly and many believe he is to old to be President. I was in the doctors waiting room and there was an old man in the waiting room and he was talking about that Biden is too old to be president and that America needs a younger president.  Notice how Trumps security guards made a circle around him to protect him? I have admiration for anybody that works in security as they are putting their own lives at risk to save other people‚Äôs lives. Many security guards lose their lives due to the jobs they work in. It‚Äôs a ballsy job to have. Gotta give credit to them.  #donaldtrump#joebiden,2024-07-14 03:28:45 GMT

As a non-usamerican as someone who is pro Palestine as an anarchist: I am begging you with every fibre of my being to go to the fucking polls this fall and  VOTE. Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt live in the united states and I never have and I probably never will. I can never truly understand what it‚Äôs like to be a usamerican and I‚Äôm not going to pretend like i could. I fully expect to get called a fascist or some shit for saying your should exercise your right to vote but at this point I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm scared we‚Äôre all scared and news like we‚Äôve just gotten tonight is only going to compound the fear and chaos and conspiracy thought and fearmongering and hopelesspilled doomerism we‚Äôre all dealing with rn. I don‚Äôt want to make anyone‚Äôs day worse. I‚Äôm not looking to debate you. I just want to say some things that i‚Äôve been thinking about for a long time now while a couple people might actually stop to listen.  The united states of america is the most powerful country in the world.  What happens in the united states government this fall will affect every single person on the planet in some way for better or worse.  You aren‚Äôt just voting blue to avoid trump turning the united states into an alt-right theocratic dictatorship (which on its own is bad enough). You‚Äôre also voting to avoid the right from gaining power (where they haven‚Äôt already) in of other powerful democratic countries. You‚Äôre voting to stop Palestine (and let‚Äôs be real probably a handful of other places) from being wiped off the face of the planet with nuclear bombs. You‚Äôre potentially voting to avoid a third world war. I‚Äôm not saying this to spread fear of these things happening. I‚Äôm saying this because if you‚Äôre not already aware of how huge the scope is here: you‚Äôre not voting to save your country you‚Äôre very likely voting to save the entire world.  I can‚Äôt speak to how people feel everywhere (if you‚Äôre also a non-usamerican please feel free to share how this is/has/will affect your country in the notes) but I want to speak to my own for a bit. I can confidently say that what happens in america heavily affects the political and social situation here in canada. We would not have had a convoy of thousands of people drive across the country (which takes days to do) to occupy our capital city for a month and halt almost $4 billion in trade to protest i kid you not wearing a mask during covid if trump supporters hadn‚Äôt paved the way (and directly influenced canadians to follow in their footsteps). We wouldn‚Äôt have had ‚Äúconcerned parents‚Äù protesting against sex-ed and LGBTQ+ inclusivity in schools (protests full of armed+mounted police which they brought their young children to during school hours) if trump supporters hadn‚Äôt paved the way. There are people waving flags and signs around on street corners along major roads every single week everywhere from the largest city in our country to small towns of under 5000 people. I‚Äôve heard of people who‚Äôve spiraled into such severe conspiracy rabbitholes that their entire lives and personalities have changed in just a few years. Despite being canadian nationalists these people and their patterns of behaviour are all a direct result of donald j trump and his followers. And no matter your political leaning pretty much everyone hates our current prime minister our economy is bad even people with decent incomes can‚Äôt afford to eat and everyone is frothing at the mouth for something to happen. If america votes trump this fall I see very little hope that our country won‚Äôt vote conservative (our main right-wing party). They will backpedal decades of LGBTQ+ rights and Indigenous peoples‚Äô rights and climate action funding and children‚Äôs education and a whole pile of other important stuff. They have made it very clear that they will follow the exact same path as right wing america and there are a scary amount of people here who want that. And even if canada remains centre/left while sharing the largest land border in the world with a trump dictatorship‚Ä¶.well I for one can‚Äôt see that going over very well either.  And that‚Äôs just my country. I know a lot of other countries have been battling a similar spike in alt-right groups and conservative ideologies following the last trump presidency. I don‚Äôt think any of us are truly prepared for what will happen in the event of another one.  Look. I hate biden too. In general I disagree with the very concept of colonial government and money and the division of countries/states/etc and the legal/carceral system and a whole whack of other shit that we have to live with right now. Someone‚Äôs said this before but if any of us thought that telling you guys to blow up a walmart would save your country from a fascist dictatorship I for one would encourage it. But none of us are actually going to blow up a walmart and it wouldn‚Äôt solve anything at this point anyways. We all have to take action in whatever ways we actually can and will. Voting is one of many small simple steps you can take should take fucking better be taking. It‚Äôs easy it‚Äôs legal if you mail in you don‚Äôt even have to go to the polling station and if you really can‚Äôt vote for whatever reason encourage everyone you know who can to do so. Hell if I could vote on november 5th I would crawl my ass over the border on my hands and knees to do it. I‚Äôm sorry that the two options are a fascist police state and an even worse fascist police state run by a man who thinks he‚Äôs a god but not voting won‚Äôt fix that problem. You‚Äôre not going to establish a revolution by purposefully not taking part in social change and encouraging others not to either. Not voting against trump = voting for trump. If you don‚Äôt vote and that orange nukefucker takes over your country it is your fault. And we‚Äôre all going to pay for your inaction especially the people in places like Palestine who will be in significantly more danger than they already are if trump gets his fake tanned hands on the situation.  Anyways. Keep fighting. Stay safe. Do what you can. Don‚Äôt give up. There is always hope for a better future. And for fucks sake go vote.  Oh and if we do end up in the worst timeline this november and I see you anti-voting fuckers making ‚Äúlmao time to move to canada‚Äù jokes‚Ä¶count your fucking days.  -  TLDR: usamerica is not the only place in the world affected by the actions of usamerica. If you‚Äôre still railing against voting at this point you‚Äôre pro-trump lmao.,2024-07-14 07:06:53 GMT

7,Joe Biden,['us politics'  'donald trump'],gayleonofcuy,The attempt itself may not be enough to win the election but Trump will enter next week with 2 extremely significant advantages. First the Republican convention starts next monday. It was already threatening to be a festival of nationalism but now *decorum* means that Democrats will offer only the most restrained and tepid responses instead of the vigorous denunciation it deserves. Second one of the biggest reasons trump won the 2016 election was the live broadcasts of his rallies by every tv network. Some stopped after he won (and lots of criticism) but as of now that‚Äôs probably all off. News channels are probably going to start covering his rallies live for at least for the next few weeks. This is millions of dollars worth of free advertising right before the election. And yes *that* image is just the icing on the cake.,2024-07-14 08:47:28 GMT

11,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'e. jean carroll'  'carroll v. trump'  'rape'  'donald trump rape allegations'  'donald trump rape scandal'  'biden rallies'  'lewis kaplan'],justinspoliticalcorner,Biden is right: Trump is a rapist and it‚Äôs long past time the media use that word!  Dean Obeidallah at The Dean‚Äôs Report:  President Biden is not playing. He came out Friday and delivered what even the awful NY Times dubbed a ‚Äúfiery‚Äù speech before a boisterous crowd in Michigan where thousands cheered: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you quit!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got your back!‚Äù The audience laughed at Biden‚Äôs barbs about Trump‚Äôs failed businesses declaring Trump ‚Äúeven went bankrupt running a casino ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt think that was even possible. Doesn‚Äôt the house always win in a casino?!‚Äù And when Biden touched on Trump being a convicted felon the crowd organically chanted ‚ÄúLock him up!‚Äù   But it was Biden‚Äôs line rightfully calling Trump a ‚Äúrapist‚Äù that needs to be repeated by Democrats to force the media to cover this fact so that it becomes a visible part of the 2024 election. And that was Biden‚Äôs very point as he called out the corporate media‚Äôs failure to cover so much about Trump while instead dissecting every syllable uttered by the President.  As Biden correctly told the excited crowd the media has been holding him to a different standard by ignoring Trump‚Äôs crimes etc. But Biden defiantly declared that was going to end now: ‚ÄúNo more free passes!‚Äù Biden continued ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôre going to shine a spotlight on Donald Trump. We‚Äôre going to do what the press so far hasn‚Äôt‚Äù adding ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to say who he is.‚Äù   That is when Biden leaned into Trump being found liable for rape in the civil case brought by journalist E. Jean Carroll. Biden told his throngs of supporters: ‚ÄúDonald Trump was found liable for sexual assault by a judge who told us not to be fooled by Trump brushing it off.‚Äù The President continued ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what the judge wrote. Quote the judge in that case wrote quote ‚ÄòMr. Trump attempted to minimize sexual abuse finding it frivolous. Mr. Trump raped her.‚Äô That‚Äôs the judge‚Äôs language not mine.‚Äù Adding ‚ÄúRaped her as many people understand the word rape.‚Äù   That is correct and it deserves far more coverage. Donald Trump is a rapist as a federal judge determined after reviewing the evidence and jury verdict.  As a quick reminder E. Jean Carroll had stated that Trump had sexually assaulted her in 1996 while she was in a dressing room in an upscale department store. Carroll sued Trump in this case for both the attack and for defamation because he called her a liar publicly ridiculed her as making up the story to sell books and more causing damage to her reputation and inflicting emotional distress.   In May 2023 a federal jury unanimously found that Trump‚Äîwho was represented by well-known lawyers in the trial‚Äîhad ‚Äúsexually abused‚Äù Carroll and did defame her thus awarding her $5 million. The jury did not however find that Trump had ‚Äúraped‚Äù her in the narrow definition of the NY Penal law but this was not a criminal trial only a civil one seeking damages. (You can read the actual jury verdict form here.)  What Biden was referring to as Trump being adjudicated a rapist comes from what the federal judge presiding over the case Lewis A. Kaplan ruled in July 2023 in response to Trump‚Äôs motion to set aside the verdict. Judge Kaplan wrote in his decision (which you can read here) that what Trump did was in fact rape as commonly understood.   As the judge explained ‚ÄúCarroll failed to prove that she was ‚Äúraped‚Äù within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‚Äúraped‚Äù her as many people commonly understand the word ‚Äúrape.‚Äù Indeed as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.‚Äù     President Biden is right to call Donald Trump a rapist.,2024-07-14 09:31:28 GMT

7,Joe Biden,['us politics'  'donald trump'],gayleonofcuy,The attempt itself may not be enough to win the election but Trump will enter next week with 2 extremely significant advantages. First the Republican convention starts next monday. It was already threatening to be a festival of nationalism but now *decorum* means that Democrats will offer only the most restrained and tepid responses instead of the vigorous denunciation it deserves. Second one of the biggest reasons trump won the 2016 election was the live broadcasts of his rallies by every tv network. Some stopped after he won (and lots of criticism) but as of now that‚Äôs probably all off. News channels are probably going to start covering his rallies live for at least for the next few weeks. This is millions of dollars worth of free advertising right before the election. And yes *that* image is just the icing on the cake.,2024-07-14 08:47:28 GMT

23,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'us politics'  'i love all of you'  'i truly believe we can do this'  'democrats'],darkskyatnight,I‚Äôve been trying to think about what to say for a few hours now.  People are freaked. Understandably. The orange tumour nearly getting domed has put the conservatives in an utter manic frenzy and it feels darker than ever.  And yet still I see people whining about Biden.  I want people to come down to base level for a moment. This is addressed to the people not voting. I want you to think of the last person you sat next to. Maybe it was your partner. Your mom your dad. The person on the bus next to you.  I want you to think of the small family who runs the convenience store down the road from you every day without fail. The old man who works at the post office who‚Äôs always kind to you. The old lady who believes a little too much in astrology but is always there to say ‚ÄòYou CAN do this you will be able to do whatever you set your mind to.‚Äô  If the orange tumour gets back into power what happens to them? The old man lives alone struggles to get to work every day. He has people who can help him thanks to social programs but the orange tumour gets in those social programs are GONE.  The old lady who believes that little bit too much in astrology could be dismissed as batshit crazy hysterical by some anti-science nutcase and can snitch on her. She‚Äôd be taken to a mental health hospital and could never be seen again for all you know.  That small family who runs the convenience store? Could have their shop shut down because the Republicans torched it. They were ran out of town and are now struggling just to make ten dollars to feed their kids. Hard-working people of the land burned by geriatric fucks who want to commit treason.  The person on the bus next to you is a queer teenager not out to their parents yet. They live in a blue state now but the orange tumour gets back in and that state goes red IMMEDIATELY. Their teachers snitch to their parents and they get beaten until they land in hospital.  There is an inherent horror in participating in this system. There is an inherent horror in the violence it inflicts on ordinary working class people and if the orange tumour gets back in he will affect the WORLD.  The Republicans bitch and moan about duty about service. Duty and service isn‚Äôt joining the military to raid some poor Arab town for oil money. It‚Äôs looking at the person across from you day after day and knowing you have a duty even if unspoken to lift them up and to help them. Assistance is the base form of humanity and I believe that with all my heart. But you must commit to it.  Duty is not a thing you can half-ass and I have no tolerance for incompetency. It‚Äôs all well and good us chatting shit on the internet but will you put your money where your mouth is? If you don‚Äôt wanna vote fine go sit in the corner and let the adults do the work because you are behaving like a CHILD. A petulant child who is only thinking of themselves and how to keep the blood off of their hands.  Well I got news for you. Everyone who participates in this system has blood on their hands whether they like it or not. What matters is what you do to wipe that red from your ledger. One single person one single vote right now on the precipice on the literal cliff‚Äôs edge there is hope. You can make that change you can vote.  You have a right to have your say. There is a saying: ‚ÄúIn the dark is where light shines the most.‚Äù I love that quote. Truly I do. I spent years with no hope thinking there was no way out of that tunnel. Connecting with people on a human level taught me that to get out you have to have a fire. Something you burn into your core and that you stick to because the moment you let go of it you fall. It‚Äôs the rock you cling to so you don‚Äôt die a bloody death.  I want all of you to think about just what kind of fire you got in you. Is it a candle meant for keeping the ones you love warm or is it an inferno a powerful force of nature that can change a landscape for generations paving the way for the future?  In your travels I want you to connect with people. We cannot keep arguing like this we just can‚Äôt. Every single time we fracture we lose another battle. We need a common goal we need empathy we need discipline. Right now right here is the time to tie ourselves together or not at all.  On November 5th you‚Äôre gonna walk into your voting booth. If someone tries to stop you you think of all those lives you can save and you push past them. You walk into that booth and you cast your say I don‚Äôt care for who. But you vote. That is ALL I ask of you.,2024-07-14 10:34:30 GMT

0,Joe Biden,['blacklivesmatter'  'blackvotersmatters'  'donald trump'  'naacp'  'blackmediamatters'  'blackvotersmatter'  'news'  'ados'  'youtube'],rauthschild,We are officially over the target and catching the flak; this past two weeks has seen an unprecedented effort by agencies and quasi-military personnel to promote slander and other harassments aimed at discrediting Federation officers and personnel.   This is no doubt the result of our view of the activities of our unlawfully converted military and both of their corporate presidential candidates and our objection to their continued hegemony apart from civilian oversight and also our direct objection to their plan to substitute a British Territorial ‚ÄúRepublic‚Äù for the American Republic we are owed.   We don‚Äôt pander for the simple reason that there has been more than enough of that. Plain-speaking and truth is what is required to overcome the criminality that Corporate Feudalism bankers dishonest clergy politicians and mercenary armies have made of this world.   We also object to and disapprove of spraying the Earth with incendiary waste products from various industries as chemtrails exploding shells full of used but still highly radioactive nuclear wastes promoting outlawed biological and chemical warfare phony vaccines and pandemics.   We even object to and protest their loathsome practice of incubating screw worms and broadcasting millions of maggots over countries like Argentina and Panama ‚Äî introducing an alien species of flesh and blood eating flies to infect and feed upon domestic livestock and human beings in countries that have traditionally been friends of ours.   We objected to the insane invasion of Libya for the ‚Äúcrime‚Äù of advocating an African Union similar to our own and the use of gold-backed currency among the Union members. We think it is obvious who the criminals were in this matter and it wasn‚Äôt Gaddafi.   We object to the monopolization of the money transfer system SWIFT the imposition of non-negotiable legal tender such as EUROS and FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES and the many instances of failed legalization of regulations and acts of legislation which are criminal in nature and were never remedied by providing access to exemptions debt swaps and other means to legalize them.   Yes we object to all of this and more.   We object to the existence of arbitrarily imposed and illegal and criminally misused ‚ÄúState Trusts‚Äù which have been used to latch onto American assets and misuse them as Slush Funds for politicians and as collateral for foreign debts ‚Äî we especially object to foreign war debts and wars for profit being waged using our people as cheap mercenaries and our assets being used as the collateral funding it and our good names being slandered in the process.   Yes we object. We disapprove. We protest. We are not at all pleased with this insane misuse and abuse of our assets by purported ‚Äúcustodians and trustees‚Äù we never appointed to these duties and impositions made upon us based on the completely false idea that we were ‚Äúabsent‚Äù or adopting foreign citizenship obligations.   By what possible ‚Äúauthority‚Äù do these corporations continue to carry out actions like these ‚Äúin the name of‚Äù our government?   These are not acts of war or anything politically motivated; these are acts of genocide both in actuality and on paper with commercial advantages being sought‚Äì crimes in other words.   Even the recent U.S. Supreme Court actions allowing the British Territorial State Trusts to use our Autochthonous gold reserves to mint gold coinage for their own use is a violation of our property rights and contracts; our contracts with the actual States of the Union require that we ‚Äì not they ‚Äì provide a National Coinage and Currency for the use of all the States.   They and everyone else in the world can see that we are here and doing our job.   We have served due process and notice and record of our actions over the course of three decades; we have published our lineage treaties and identified ourselves and recorded and cured and published our claims. There can be no doubt that we are native to America and to our specific States of the Union. And there can be no doubt that any claims otherwise based on undisclosed ‚Äúregistrations‚Äù of American babies are unconscionable and illegal and self-interested.   We have resumed operations in spite of all this British hokum and are in General Assembly in all fifty (50) States of the Union.   We have taken care of housekeeping such as enrolling all the incipient Territorial ‚ÄúStates‚Äù as States of the Union and completing the process mandated by the Northwest Ordinance.  We have published the first Public Law in decades outlawing claims by patent holders seeking to enslave people by undisclosed injection of patented mRNA or DNA materials.   We are here presenting ourselves. And their response? Do they yield as required by their employment contracts to the remaining civilian authority of the actual American Government?  Will they continue to pretend that the ‚Äúabsence‚Äù of a lackey organization wielding delegated power somehow overcomes the right of the delegator to exercise their own powers directly?   Obviously these men are not reading their contract nor are they listening to their employers and they have continued to engage in criminal acts including fraudulently misrepresenting their corporate elections as public elections.   A recent expose on the website of the Comptroller of the Currency shows their preparations for a ‚Äúglobal reset‚Äù of currency values without however facing the basic questions of ownership representation and resources.   We have reclaimed the assets of the State Trusts and they have been fully informed that the living progeny of the victims whose property was cashiered illegally by the British Territorial Raj are here to collect their birthright assets that our purported custodians socked away ‚Äúfor‚Äù us and then taxed us for the use of our own land and our own credit.   These are the acts and thoughts of criminals engaged in illegal booty and prize salvaging. These are the acts and thoughts of Executors de Son Tort.   In Law there is no excuse for the continued pretenses and obstructions that these foreign Principals and their corporations masquerading as governments have made.   They know that we are owed an immediate and unquestioned liquidation of these State Trusts in our favor.   They also know that even though they have acted as corporations when they seized upon and copyrighted our Given Names in order to create corporate franchises for their own benefit they acted as Public Usufructs to legalize this action.   As such they owe us the Usufructuary Duty to hold us harmless from all charges and injuries accruing from their action.   That means that their Principals are responsible for paying all bills all charges all penalties all fees all taxes all insurances related to their franchises and to hold us harmless ‚Äî but have they?   No they have not.   They have pretended that their franchise taxes are our taxes that their franchise‚Äôs citizenship obligations are our obligations and so far worked to confuse the identity of the living man with the En Legis &quot;person&quot; they named after us that most of the world including the victims have been fooled by this chicanery.   They have claimed a repugnant ownership interest in their imaginary franchises named after us taken out insurance policies on these franchises and on their franchises‚Äô purported property assets used them as collateral backing their own debts and then not even had the decency to use the life insurance to pay off the debts still owed by these ‚Äúfranchises‚Äù when they die.   The $950 Trillion in ‚ÄúLife Force Value Annuities‚Äù ‚Äî another pot of insurance premiums ‚Äì that Prince Philip received in April 2017 from the GOVERNOR OF OTTAWA ‚Äì should have been used to pay off a substantial part of the world debt.   Instead it disappeared while the insurmountable debt being amassed on the clueless victims of these scam artists continued to climb and to devalue the entire world financial system.   It‚Äôs time for all the purloined assets to be returned and for this to be accomplished in an honest and transparent fashion.   First in America all title right and interest in land seized upon illegally and without full disclosure in the 1860s and again in the 1930‚Äôs and placed in State Trusts must be returned to the living heirs still living on and possessing title to such land.   You may begin with all lands and land assets held in the Wisconsin State Trust in the name of Julius Alfred Schnur and Alfred Julius Schnur their heirs and assigns ‚Äì to be returned together with all cadastral surveys patents plat numbers and titles to Anna Maria Riezinger at our Fiduciary Office address listed below.   This is a lawful demand for liquidation of illegally seized-upon Wisconsin State Trust Assets via return to the rightful owner. Proof of life and identity have already been provided.   Second bank liens and security interests based on fraudulent misrepresentation and the practice of loaning the victim his own credit must be released.   Third all property taxes assigned or collected on the basis of this fraudulent salvage operation must be credited to the rightful owner(s).   Fourth the profits gained from these unlawful illegal and immoral activities must be seized upon and used to provide restitution to the victims.   We are not interested in an artificial ‚ÄúGreat Reset‚Äù that does nothing but victimize the victims again while building yet another financial edifice on fraud and sand.,2024-07-14 10:26:27 GMT

11,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'e. jean carroll'  'carroll v. trump'  'rape'  'donald trump rape allegations'  'donald trump rape scandal'  'biden rallies'  'lewis kaplan'],justinspoliticalcorner,Biden is right: Trump is a rapist and it‚Äôs long past time the media use that word!  Dean Obeidallah at The Dean‚Äôs Report:  President Biden is not playing. He came out Friday and delivered what even the awful NY Times dubbed a ‚Äúfiery‚Äù speech before a boisterous crowd in Michigan where thousands cheered: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you quit!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got your back!‚Äù The audience laughed at Biden‚Äôs barbs about Trump‚Äôs failed businesses declaring Trump ‚Äúeven went bankrupt running a casino ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt think that was even possible. Doesn‚Äôt the house always win in a casino?!‚Äù And when Biden touched on Trump being a convicted felon the crowd organically chanted ‚ÄúLock him up!‚Äù   But it was Biden‚Äôs line rightfully calling Trump a ‚Äúrapist‚Äù that needs to be repeated by Democrats to force the media to cover this fact so that it becomes a visible part of the 2024 election. And that was Biden‚Äôs very point as he called out the corporate media‚Äôs failure to cover so much about Trump while instead dissecting every syllable uttered by the President.  As Biden correctly told the excited crowd the media has been holding him to a different standard by ignoring Trump‚Äôs crimes etc. But Biden defiantly declared that was going to end now: ‚ÄúNo more free passes!‚Äù Biden continued ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôre going to shine a spotlight on Donald Trump. We‚Äôre going to do what the press so far hasn‚Äôt‚Äù adding ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to say who he is.‚Äù   That is when Biden leaned into Trump being found liable for rape in the civil case brought by journalist E. Jean Carroll. Biden told his throngs of supporters: ‚ÄúDonald Trump was found liable for sexual assault by a judge who told us not to be fooled by Trump brushing it off.‚Äù The President continued ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what the judge wrote. Quote the judge in that case wrote quote ‚ÄòMr. Trump attempted to minimize sexual abuse finding it frivolous. Mr. Trump raped her.‚Äô That‚Äôs the judge‚Äôs language not mine.‚Äù Adding ‚ÄúRaped her as many people understand the word rape.‚Äù   That is correct and it deserves far more coverage. Donald Trump is a rapist as a federal judge determined after reviewing the evidence and jury verdict.  As a quick reminder E. Jean Carroll had stated that Trump had sexually assaulted her in 1996 while she was in a dressing room in an upscale department store. Carroll sued Trump in this case for both the attack and for defamation because he called her a liar publicly ridiculed her as making up the story to sell books and more causing damage to her reputation and inflicting emotional distress.   In May 2023 a federal jury unanimously found that Trump‚Äîwho was represented by well-known lawyers in the trial‚Äîhad ‚Äúsexually abused‚Äù Carroll and did defame her thus awarding her $5 million. The jury did not however find that Trump had ‚Äúraped‚Äù her in the narrow definition of the NY Penal law but this was not a criminal trial only a civil one seeking damages. (You can read the actual jury verdict form here.)  What Biden was referring to as Trump being adjudicated a rapist comes from what the federal judge presiding over the case Lewis A. Kaplan ruled in July 2023 in response to Trump‚Äôs motion to set aside the verdict. Judge Kaplan wrote in his decision (which you can read here) that what Trump did was in fact rape as commonly understood.   As the judge explained ‚ÄúCarroll failed to prove that she was ‚Äúraped‚Äù within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‚Äúraped‚Äù her as many people commonly understand the word ‚Äúrape.‚Äù Indeed as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.‚Äù     President Biden is right to call Donald Trump a rapist.,2024-07-14 09:31:28 GMT

7,Joe Biden,['us politics'  'donald trump'],gayleonofcuy,The attempt itself may not be enough to win the election but Trump will enter next week with 2 extremely significant advantages. First the Republican convention starts next monday. It was already threatening to be a festival of nationalism but now *decorum* means that Democrats will offer only the most restrained and tepid responses instead of the vigorous denunciation it deserves. Second one of the biggest reasons trump won the 2016 election was the live broadcasts of his rallies by every tv network. Some stopped after he won (and lots of criticism) but as of now that‚Äôs probably all off. News channels are probably going to start covering his rallies live for at least for the next few weeks. This is millions of dollars worth of free advertising right before the election. And yes *that* image is just the icing on the cake.,2024-07-14 08:47:28 GMT

There is a saying: ‚ÄúIn the dark is where light shines the most.‚Äù I love that quote. Truly I do. I spent years with no hope thinking there was no way out of that tunnel. Connecting with people on a human level taught me that to get out you have to have a fire. Something you burn into your core and that you stick to because the moment you let go of it you fall. It‚Äôs the rock you cling to so you don‚Äôt die a bloody death.  I want all of you to think about just what kind of fire you got in you. Is it a candle meant for keeping the ones you love warm or is it an inferno a powerful force of nature that can change a landscape for generations paving the way for the future?  In your travels I want you to connect with people. We cannot keep arguing like this we just can‚Äôt. Every single time we fracture we lose another battle. We need a common goal we need empathy we need discipline. Right now right here is the time to tie ourselves together or not at all.  On November 5th you‚Äôre gonna walk into your voting booth. If someone tries to stop you you think of all those lives you can save and you push past them. You walk into that booth and you cast your say I don‚Äôt care for who. But you vote. That is ALL I ask of you.,2024-07-14 10:34:30 GMT

0,Joe Biden,['blacklivesmatter'  'blackvotersmatters'  'donald trump'  'naacp'  'blackmediamatters'  'blackvotersmatter'  'news'  'ados'  'youtube'],rauthschild,We are officially over the target and catching the flak; this past two weeks has seen an unprecedented effort by agencies and quasi-military personnel to promote slander and other harassments aimed at discrediting Federation officers and personnel.   This is no doubt the result of our view of the activities of our unlawfully converted military and both of their corporate presidential candidates and our objection to their continued hegemony apart from civilian oversight and also our direct objection to their plan to substitute a British Territorial ‚ÄúRepublic‚Äù for the American Republic we are owed.   We don‚Äôt pander for the simple reason that there has been more than enough of that. Plain-speaking and truth is what is required to overcome the criminality that Corporate Feudalism bankers dishonest clergy politicians and mercenary armies have made of this world.   We also object to and disapprove of spraying the Earth with incendiary waste products from various industries as chemtrails exploding shells full of used but still highly radioactive nuclear wastes promoting outlawed biological and chemical warfare phony vaccines and pandemics.   We even object to and protest their loathsome practice of incubating screw worms and broadcasting millions of maggots over countries like Argentina and Panama ‚Äî introducing an alien species of flesh and blood eating flies to infect and feed upon domestic livestock and human beings in countries that have traditionally been friends of ours.   We objected to the insane invasion of Libya for the ‚Äúcrime‚Äù of advocating an African Union similar to our own and the use of gold-backed currency among the Union members. We think it is obvious who the criminals were in this matter and it wasn‚Äôt Gaddafi.   We object to the monopolization of the money transfer system SWIFT the imposition of non-negotiable legal tender such as EUROS and FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES and the many instances of failed legalization of regulations and acts of legislation which are criminal in nature and were never remedied by providing access to exemptions debt swaps and other means to legalize them.   Yes we object to all of this and more.   We object to the existence of arbitrarily imposed and illegal and criminally misused ‚ÄúState Trusts‚Äù which have been used to latch onto American assets and misuse them as Slush Funds for politicians and as collateral for foreign debts ‚Äî we especially object to foreign war debts and wars for profit being waged using our people as cheap mercenaries and our assets being used as the collateral funding it and our good names being slandered in the process.   Yes we object. We disapprove. We protest. We are not at all pleased with this insane misuse and abuse of our assets by purported ‚Äúcustodians and trustees‚Äù we never appointed to these duties and impositions made upon us based on the completely false idea that we were ‚Äúabsent‚Äù or adopting foreign citizenship obligations.   By what possible ‚Äúauthority‚Äù do these corporations continue to carry out actions like these ‚Äúin the name of‚Äù our government?   These are not acts of war or anything politically motivated; these are acts of genocide both in actuality and on paper with commercial advantages being sought‚Äì crimes in other words.   Even the recent U.S. Supreme Court actions allowing the British Territorial State Trusts to use our Autochthonous gold reserves to mint gold coinage for their own use is a violation of our property rights and contracts; our contracts with the actual States of the Union require that we ‚Äì not they ‚Äì provide a National Coinage and Currency for the use of all the States.   They and everyone else in the world can see that we are here and doing our job.   We have served due process and notice and record of our actions over the course of three decades; we have published our lineage treaties and identified ourselves and recorded and cured and published our claims. There can be no doubt that we are native to America and to our specific States of the Union. And there can be no doubt that any claims otherwise based on undisclosed ‚Äúregistrations‚Äù of American babies are unconscionable and illegal and self-interested.   We have resumed operations in spite of all this British hokum and are in General Assembly in all fifty (50) States of the Union.   We have taken care of housekeeping such as enrolling all the incipient Territorial ‚ÄúStates‚Äù as States of the Union and completing the process mandated by the Northwest Ordinance.  We have published the first Public Law in decades outlawing claims by patent holders seeking to enslave people by undisclosed injection of patented mRNA or DNA materials.   We are here presenting ourselves. And their response? Do they yield as required by their employment contracts to the remaining civilian authority of the actual American Government?  Will they continue to pretend that the ‚Äúabsence‚Äù of a lackey organization wielding delegated power somehow overcomes the right of the delegator to exercise their own powers directly?   Obviously these men are not reading their contract nor are they listening to their employers and they have continued to engage in criminal acts including fraudulently misrepresenting their corporate elections as public elections.   A recent expose on the website of the Comptroller of the Currency shows their preparations for a ‚Äúglobal reset‚Äù of currency values without however facing the basic questions of ownership representation and resources.   We have reclaimed the assets of the State Trusts and they have been fully informed that the living progeny of the victims whose property was cashiered illegally by the British Territorial Raj are here to collect their birthright assets that our purported custodians socked away ‚Äúfor‚Äù us and then taxed us for the use of our own land and our own credit.   These are the acts and thoughts of criminals engaged in illegal booty and prize salvaging. These are the acts and thoughts of Executors de Son Tort.   In Law there is no excuse for the continued pretenses and obstructions that these foreign Principals and their corporations masquerading as governments have made.   They know that we are owed an immediate and unquestioned liquidation of these State Trusts in our favor.   They also know that even though they have acted as corporations when they seized upon and copyrighted our Given Names in order to create corporate franchises for their own benefit they acted as Public Usufructs to legalize this action.   As such they owe us the Usufructuary Duty to hold us harmless from all charges and injuries accruing from their action.   That means that their Principals are responsible for paying all bills all charges all penalties all fees all taxes all insurances related to their franchises and to hold us harmless ‚Äî but have they?   No they have not.   They have pretended that their franchise taxes are our taxes that their franchise‚Äôs citizenship obligations are our obligations and so far worked to confuse the identity of the living man with the En Legis &quot;person&quot; they named after us that most of the world including the victims have been fooled by this chicanery.   They have claimed a repugnant ownership interest in their imaginary franchises named after us taken out insurance policies on these franchises and on their franchises‚Äô purported property assets used them as collateral backing their own debts and then not even had the decency to use the life insurance to pay off the debts still owed by these ‚Äúfranchises‚Äù when they die.   The $950 Trillion in ‚ÄúLife Force Value Annuities‚Äù ‚Äî another pot of insurance premiums ‚Äì that Prince Philip received in April 2017 from the GOVERNOR OF OTTAWA ‚Äì should have been used to pay off a substantial part of the world debt.   Instead it disappeared while the insurmountable debt being amassed on the clueless victims of these scam artists continued to climb and to devalue the entire world financial system.   It‚Äôs time for all the purloined assets to be returned and for this to be accomplished in an honest and transparent fashion.   First in America all title right and interest in land seized upon illegally and without full disclosure in the 1860s and again in the 1930‚Äôs and placed in State Trusts must be returned to the living heirs still living on and possessing title to such land.   You may begin with all lands and land assets held in the Wisconsin State Trust in the name of Julius Alfred Schnur and Alfred Julius Schnur their heirs and assigns ‚Äì to be returned together with all cadastral surveys patents plat numbers and titles to Anna Maria Riezinger at our Fiduciary Office address listed below.   This is a lawful demand for liquidation of illegally seized-upon Wisconsin State Trust Assets via return to the rightful owner. Proof of life and identity have already been provided.   Second bank liens and security interests based on fraudulent misrepresentation and the practice of loaning the victim his own credit must be released.   Third all property taxes assigned or collected on the basis of this fraudulent salvage operation must be credited to the rightful owner(s).   Fourth the profits gained from these unlawful illegal and immoral activities must be seized upon and used to provide restitution to the victims.   We are not interested in an artificial ‚ÄúGreat Reset‚Äù that does nothing but victimize the victims again while building yet another financial edifice on fraud and sand.,2024-07-14 10:26:27 GMT

11,Joe Biden,['donald trump'  'e. jean carroll'  'carroll v. trump'  'rape'  'donald trump rape allegations'  'donald trump rape scandal'  'biden rallies'  'lewis kaplan'],justinspoliticalcorner,Biden is right: Trump is a rapist and it‚Äôs long past time the media use that word!  Dean Obeidallah at The Dean‚Äôs Report:  President Biden is not playing. He came out Friday and delivered what even the awful NY Times dubbed a ‚Äúfiery‚Äù speech before a boisterous crowd in Michigan where thousands cheered: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you quit!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got your back!‚Äù The audience laughed at Biden‚Äôs barbs about Trump‚Äôs failed businesses declaring Trump ‚Äúeven went bankrupt running a casino ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt think that was even possible. Doesn‚Äôt the house always win in a casino?!‚Äù And when Biden touched on Trump being a convicted felon the crowd organically chanted ‚ÄúLock him up!‚Äù   But it was Biden‚Äôs line rightfully calling Trump a ‚Äúrapist‚Äù that needs to be repeated by Democrats to force the media to cover this fact so that it becomes a visible part of the 2024 election. And that was Biden‚Äôs very point as he called out the corporate media‚Äôs failure to cover so much about Trump while instead dissecting every syllable uttered by the President.  As Biden correctly told the excited crowd the media has been holding him to a different standard by ignoring Trump‚Äôs crimes etc. But Biden defiantly declared that was going to end now: ‚ÄúNo more free passes!‚Äù Biden continued ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôre going to shine a spotlight on Donald Trump. We‚Äôre going to do what the press so far hasn‚Äôt‚Äù adding ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to say who he is.‚Äù   That is when Biden leaned into Trump being found liable for rape in the civil case brought by journalist E. Jean Carroll. Biden told his throngs of supporters: ‚ÄúDonald Trump was found liable for sexual assault by a judge who told us not to be fooled by Trump brushing it off.‚Äù The President continued ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what the judge wrote. Quote the judge in that case wrote quote ‚ÄòMr. Trump attempted to minimize sexual abuse finding it frivolous. Mr. Trump raped her.‚Äô That‚Äôs the judge‚Äôs language not mine.‚Äù Adding ‚ÄúRaped her as many people understand the word rape.‚Äù   That is correct and it deserves far more coverage. Donald Trump is a rapist as a federal judge determined after reviewing the evidence and jury verdict.  As a quick reminder E. Jean Carroll had stated that Trump had sexually assaulted her in 1996 while she was in a dressing room in an upscale department store. Carroll sued Trump in this case for both the attack and for defamation because he called her a liar publicly ridiculed her as making up the story to sell books and more causing damage to her reputation and inflicting emotional distress.   In May 2023 a federal jury unanimously found that Trump‚Äîwho was represented by well-known lawyers in the trial‚Äîhad ‚Äúsexually abused‚Äù Carroll and did defame her thus awarding her $5 million. The jury did not however find that Trump had ‚Äúraped‚Äù her in the narrow definition of the NY Penal law but this was not a criminal trial only a civil one seeking damages. (You can read the actual jury verdict form here.)  What Biden was referring to as Trump being adjudicated a rapist comes from what the federal judge presiding over the case Lewis A. Kaplan ruled in July 2023 in response to Trump‚Äôs motion to set aside the verdict. Judge Kaplan wrote in his decision (which you can read here) that what Trump did was in fact rape as commonly understood.   As the judge explained ‚ÄúCarroll failed to prove that she was ‚Äúraped‚Äù within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‚Äúraped‚Äù her as many people commonly understand the word ‚Äúrape.‚Äù Indeed as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.‚Äù     President Biden is right to call Donald Trump a rapist.,2024-07-14 09:31:28 GMT

83,Joe Biden,['vote blue no matter who'  'vote blue'  'vote biden'  'donald trump'],walks-the-ages,If I see one more post about ‚Äútrump almost getting assassinated means its the end of the world he‚Äôs guaranteed to win the election now‚Äù I‚Äôm going to scream.   First of all stop doomposting. Get your head out of that mindset and if you can‚Äôt get out of that mindset not filling your dash with doom will genuinely help.   Second of all Trump was already almost guaranteed to win. If you‚Äôre anywhere that is not on Tumblr Biden‚Äôs polling numbers are atrocious for individual states as well as nation-wide.   ~60% of Americans disapprove of Biden.   ~67% of Americans want Biden to step down and let another candidate run.   Instead of spending your time crying about how everyone needs to   ‚ÄúVote for Biden because even though he‚Äôs actively commiting genocide right now at least he promises that he will protect abortion rights and trans rights if he‚Äôs elected into power for another four years!‚Äù   aka   ‚ÄúVote for Hitler because while he may not like other people at least he promises to not take away the rights of Germans here in our country!‚Äù   Instead of supporting a genocide (voting for Biden and trying to convince people to vote for him which is the opposite of beating a dead horse) and thinking the world is going to end if Trump gets elected you should be   1) Research your other candidate options for November. It takes a single google search of ‚ÄúPresidential election candidates‚Äù and it‚Äôll come up with countless polls and articles about who all of the independent and third party candidates are.   2) Organizing within your local community or at the very least just. Get out there and get to know people. Get to know your neighbors your cashiers at the local grocery store join a local gardening Facebook group and start a small food garden in the ground or in containers. Make some community connections so if shit hits the fan you have a local support network and can help each other.   3) Listen to Palestinians. Listen to Indigenous people. Listen to Black activists. Listen to the marginalized groups who have been begging for years decades for people to see that there is no ‚ÄúLesser Evil‚Äù if the side wearing blue hat continues to commit genocide murders minorities puts kids in cages continues to put unlawful embargos on entire nations and continues to commit war crimes and attempt to topple the governments of other nations.   Project 2025 has been the Republican plan for when they get elected for the last 40 years they just so happen to have a fancy PDF to fear monger with this year.   The entire world is not going to end if Donald Trump gets elected and if you truly do think it is instead of attempting to convince people to vote for a man committing genocide that more than half the country disapproves of how about you spend your energy on convincing BIDEN to halt all military aid to Israel and to use the troops HE stationed in Israel to actually give aid and prevent more war crimes?   Oh wait. He can‚Äôt do that he‚Äôs already committed so many war crimes. they already dressed up as aid workers and slaughtered 300 innocent people for the ‚Äúsake‚Äù of 2 hostages that Israel has refused all actual negotiations to return them because Israel literally doesn‚Äôt care about hostages it just wants all of Gaza gone and under Israeli control.   You don‚Äôt fucking bomb the place you think hostages are in you don‚Äôt go around slaughtering innocent people if you care about hostages including slaughtering your own people you‚Äôre supposedly there to rescue.   Biden literally said that if there were no Israel America would have to invent its own. His opinion has not changed one bit and you can see it every time he and his group call college students protesting genocide ‚Äúoutside actors‚Äù when he further militarizes the police so they can shoot beat and maim peaceful protestors. When he claims to have seen photographs of beheaded babies that don‚Äôt exist and continues to spout claims long -debunked about October 7th.   ‚Äúviolence does not belong in our politics but only when it doesn‚Äôt involve me sadistically supporting crimes against humanity and genocide‚Äù   Anyways this post is long and rambling.   Tldr: stop acting like its the end of the world if Trump gets elected. Instead of screaming people need to vote for Genocide Joe focus your attention on getting him to step down so another candidate can take his place in August. Look up third party candidates and organize in your local community.  And don‚Äôt forget your daily clicks!      Help Palestinian refugees with a Click,2024-07-14 15:02:38 GMT

Hate how ineffective the democrats have been in general?      Wanna know the solution? Go vote. Seriously. One of 4 options happens when we all vote.   Scenario 1: Not enough of us vote Trump wins and congress gets a red wave and controls both the senate and house. This is the worst possible outcome. This is the most likely to happen if people don‚Äôt vote.     Scenario 2: Not enough of us vote Trump wins but enough of us vote blue down the ballot and congress gets a blue wave and controls both the senate and house. This is the second worst possible outcome but is the best outcome for Trump winning the presidency. It also requires people to go vote. This still means another Trump presidency and that will 100% have extremely bad downstream effects. But the same way that the republicans keep being a thorn in Democrat presidents‚Äô sides the democrats can absolutely be a major thorn in Trump‚Äôs side and limit those effects.      Scenario 3: Enough of us vote Biden wins but we get a red wave in congress. This is very possible if we vote. Its not the best outcome because it would mean 4 years of an extremely ineffective government that keeps undermining everything we need to do but it would at least have some things mitigated.      Scenario 4: Enough of us vote Biden wins we get a blue wave in congress. This is the least likely to happen but it can ONLY happen if we all go vote. Yes it means a walking corpse will be president for another 4 years but at least that walking corpse doesn‚Äôt have a god complex supported by white supremacist nationalists. This is the best outcome we can possibly hope for but requires you to actually go vote.     Please please go vote. Even scenario 2 is better than scenario 1.,2024-07-14 16:55:08 GMT

38,Joe Biden,['us politics'  'elections'  'donald trump'  'my posts'],bug-swarm,Hey is Trump being even more likely to win the election now a scary concept for you? Hate how ineffective the democrats have been in general?      Wanna know the solution? Go vote. Seriously. One of 4 options happens when we all vote.   Scenario 1: Not enough of us vote Trump wins and congress gets a red wave and controls both the senate and house. This is the worst possible outcome. This is the most likely to happen if people don‚Äôt vote.     Scenario 2: Not enough of us vote Trump wins but enough of us vote blue down the ballot and congress gets a blue wave and controls both the senate and house. This is the second worst possible outcome but is the best outcome for Trump winning the presidency. It also requires people to go vote. This still means another Trump presidency and that will 100% have extremely bad downstream effects. But the same way that the republicans keep being a thorn in Democrat presidents‚Äô sides the democrats can absolutely be a major thorn in Trump‚Äôs side and limit those effects.      Scenario 3: Enough of us vote Biden wins but we get a red wave in congress. This is very possible if we vote. Its not the best outcome because it would mean 4 years of an extremely ineffective government that keeps undermining everything we need to do but it would at least have some things mitigated.      Scenario 4: Enough of us vote Biden wins we get a blue wave in congress. This is the least likely to happen but it can ONLY happen if we all go vote. Yes it means a walking corpse will be president for another 4 years but at least that walking corpse doesn‚Äôt have a god complex supported by white supremacist nationalists. This is the best outcome we can possibly hope for but requires you to actually go vote.     Please please go vote. Even scenario 2 is better than scenario 1.,2024-07-14 16:55:08 GMT

7,Joe Biden,['this is just my thought so it might not be that accurate'  'usa politics'  'usa'  'donald trump'  'mine'],i-merani,Thinking more about this the question is ‚Äúwhat now?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat does this action achieve? Does it help Trump or not? (Does it help Biden?)‚Äù Let‚Äôs say this assassination attempt was real let‚Äôs say this was done by an extreme conservative for whom even Trump was not conservative enough (he did say after all that he wouldn‚Äôt ban abortion for example). In this case it isn‚Äôt Trump who had any agency it was some heretic acting on his own a lone wolf. In this case Trump is blameless he is a ‚Äúvictim‚Äù and obviously he can use this to his advantage. ‚ÄúThe chosen one‚Äù is targeted ‚Äúthey‚Äù want to get rid of him proving how he really is the only one who is worthy to be the president of the USA. And the conservative christians will eat this up. So I think whether this attack was staged or not it will benefit Trump. This action especially helps him to rally his supporters to actually go and vote. So what we are getting probably is more votes for Trump. This is the result of this attack.   I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much for Biden in this situation except yet another example of why gun control laws must be stricter but I don‚Äôt think Biden can get more votes because of this situation. Americans are accustomed to unregulated gun control laws public shootings are not new. It is true that Biden can focus on the need for stricter gun control laws and highlighting how Trump wouldn‚Äôt work on this but again this is self evident it won‚Äôt give Biden more votes. What Biden has to do now is figure out how to get more people to vote for him. Even though this is impossible the only thing saving Biden for now is stopping aid for Israel. Liberals don‚Äôt want their country to participate in genocide (and many conservatives too) and conservatives dont want their taxpayer money going to foreign war (same with many liberals). This action would get more people to actually go and vote for him as stakes will be higher.,2024-07-14 20:10:27 GMT
