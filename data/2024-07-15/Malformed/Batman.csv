35,Batman,['the batman'  'bruce wayne'  'the batfamily'  'batman and co'],assassin-in-a-hoodie2015,My own personal head canon is that Batman does not just ‚Äúghost‚Äù or ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù on people cuz he thinks it cool and it‚Äôs a power move.   No   Remember this fully grown man is the world‚Äôs greatest detective. There is an 9/10 possibly this man already knows what you are going to say. So in other words Brucie Wayne is just an impatient man who has no time for ‚Äúgood bye‚Äù or ‚Äúokay let‚Äôs go.‚Äù Man would rather just Irish Goodbye someone than listen to everything you got to say.   Wanna torture Bruce Wayne into giving you everything you want ? Sit him down in a chair and make him listen to a ‚Äúlong story short‚Äù conversation for all its entirety. 30 seconds into it and he‚Äôs telling you his bank card number.,2024-07-07 20:50:59 GMT

Personally Batman the animated series was my first legit introduction to batman and by proxy the batfamily and Tim Drake. For me BTAS Tim will always be my version of Tim even though he was really just Jason in everything but name sort of. However I have come up with a solution since main Canon Tim is also still my favorite batfam member.  I have mashed the two together  No hear me out ya‚Äôll-  Tim is like 4 or 5 when his parents get a divorce. His dad is broke as fuck without his suger mommy and over the course of two-three years he ends up moving into Crime Alley. Meanwhile Janet Drake is still rich living the high society Gotham life. This leaves Tim in the weirdest place possible. One week he‚Äôs living up with the best of the best eating high end meals and walking around in a suit more expensive than the average persons yearly cost of living staying in an empty house cleaned top to bottom spot less. The next week he‚Äôs crawling around in a garbage bin outside looking for something half way edible wearing a dubiously thrifted shirt and ripped up pants with more patches and holes in them that Gotham has rouges sitting in a rat infested apartment with non-stop noise outside his window dirt and grime practically melted into every surface imaginable.  Neither one of his parents cares enough about him to really fight for custody or even remember to trade Tim off consistently. People barley even know there was a divorce to begin with and neither wants to draw more attention to themselves. So Tim continues living like this back and fourth until one day when he‚Äôs 10 and his mom just. Never picks him up again. Never gets seen in Gotham again. Disappears off the face of the earth. His dad tries to drop him off at the empty mansion his mom tried to pass off as a home a few times but there‚Äôs no food or water or anything and Tim can‚Äôt live like that alone at the age of 10. Like Crime Alley was any better but at least there he had his dad.  Sometimes  He dies  Robin dies  Tim‚Äôs Robin  Nothing makes a lot of sense anymore  This AU is very important to me and has in fact become my go to version of Tim when writing anything for the batfamily. There‚Äôs just so much potential,2024-07-07 22:38:44 GMT

Maybe a little stressful when you are worried about stepping on the toes of your partner but amazing and maybe a little somber from an outside perspective.

Personally Batman the animated series was my first legit introduction to batman and by proxy the batfamily and Tim Drake. For me BTAS Tim will always be my version of Tim even though he was really just Jason in everything but name sort of. However I have come up with a solution since main Canon Tim is also still my favorite batfam member.  I have mashed the two together  No hear me out ya‚Äôll-  Tim is like 4 or 5 when his parents get a divorce. His dad is broke as fuck without his suger mommy and over the course of two-three years he ends up moving into Crime Alley. Meanwhile Janet Drake is still rich living the high society Gotham life. This leaves Tim in the weirdest place possible. One week he‚Äôs living up with the best of the best eating high end meals and walking around in a suit more expensive than the average persons yearly cost of living staying in an empty house cleaned top to bottom spot less. The next week he‚Äôs crawling around in a garbage bin outside looking for something half way edible wearing a dubiously thrifted shirt and ripped up pants with more patches and holes in them that Gotham has rouges sitting in a rat infested apartment with non-stop noise outside his window dirt and grime practically melted into every surface imaginable.  Neither one of his parents cares enough about him to really fight for custody or even remember to trade Tim off consistently. People barley even know there was a divorce to begin with and neither wants to draw more attention to themselves. So Tim continues living like this back and fourth until one day when he‚Äôs 10 and his mom just. Never picks him up again. Never gets seen in Gotham again. Disappears off the face of the earth. His dad tries to drop him off at the empty mansion his mom tried to pass off as a home a few times but there‚Äôs no food or water or anything and Tim can‚Äôt live like that alone at the age of 10. Like Crime Alley was any better but at least there he had his dad.  Sometimes  He dies  Robin dies  Tim‚Äôs Robin  Nothing makes a lot of sense anymore  This AU is very important to me and has in fact become my go to version of Tim when writing anything for the batfamily. There‚Äôs just so much potential,2024-07-07 22:38:44 GMT

'eh its a problem for future me if i decide go make this an ongoing thing'],writing-on-eafv23,i have a lot of ideas for A/B/O stuff but i can‚Äôt deny myself fluffy Grandpa Bruce    INCLUDES: A/B/O there not really much of Danny in this because he‚Äôs sleeping but he is here! light Bruce x Minhkhoa implied Bruce x others (Selina Talia Harvey etc.) Danny is de-aged in this (up to your interpretation but i was writing this imagining Danny was like 5) Omega Bruce Beta Minhkhoa Jason is mentioned Omega Jason a few spelling and grammar mistakes It was late when I was writing this   &lt;!-- more --&gt;   ‚ÄúYou never told me you had a new puppy‚Äù The familiar voice of Khoa sounds from beside Bruce had he been any less distracted with trying to babyproof the hallway he would have noticed Khoa creeping up behind him with Danny in his arms bundled up in a blanket they all had scented. Danny‚Äôs lack of any scent even a personal scent had made their pack instincts go into a tizzy so they took turns rubbing a blanket against their scent glands so at the very least their scent would rub off on Danny while Jason was making a safer safehouse to raise his new puppy. Honestly if it were up to Bruce Jason and Danny would be locked in the manor where they can be properly cared for and doted on by the pack but Bruce knew better than to interfere with a very hormonal very broody first-time Omega parent. Bruce practically bristles at the sight of Minhkhoa someone who (although he does have a situationship with) is not part of their pack holding his new grandpup. All this earns from the Beta is a chuckle ignoring Bruce‚Äôs warning growls.   ‚ÄúAnd such a cute one too look at those little fangs‚Äù Khoa coos drawing attention to how the little pup was gnawing at Khoa‚Äôs fingers as he slept leaving little indents in the brown skin. It wasn‚Äôt often Khoa was soft. Even with his own adoptive son Phanton-One Khoa saw the boy more as a project and a way to one-up Bruce than an actual son. So to see Khoa genuinely coo over a pup was‚Ä¶ odd and Bruce ignored the way it made his heart flutter slightly. However Bruce‚Äôs growls return with twice the strength when Khoa sniffs at Danny‚Äôs scent gland or rather lack thereof. Minhkhoa quirks an eyebrow under his mask when he notices the lack of scent pulling his face back  ‚ÄúPup‚Äôs got a weird smell though where‚Äôd you pick this one up from Brucie?‚Äù  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me that‚Äù Bruce replies curtly returning to placing silicone protectors on the corner of the decorative table in the hallway trying and failing to ignore how Khoa was holding Danny so gently. ‚ÄúDanny was found wandering the streets at night. He has no records no documents no missing posters not even a birth certificate. And he‚Äôs my grandpup not my puppy‚Äù  ‚ÄúSo one of yours claimed the first orphan child they saw it seems your adoption habits are contagious‚Äù Khoa always did have him pinned though that‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôve been rivals with somebody for so long.  ‚ÄúHn.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ‚Äòhn‚Äô me. Tonight was supposed to be our date night!‚Äù Comes Khoas‚Äôs complaint his voice almost whiney though he quiets down when Danny whimpers in his sleep which prompts a deep growl from Bruce that makes the Beta snicker. ‚ÄúBut I GUESS since you are SO busy with the new grandpuppy we can reschedule‚Ä¶ but you owe me two dates next month‚Äù  ‚ÄúHmn.‚Äù It‚Äôs a fair ultimatum more time to get the new pup properly scented and used to the manor and then he gets to have two date nights Bruce just hopes the others won‚Äôt get jealous. It‚Äôs hard to juggle multiple situationships but Bruce (somehow) manages to make it work.  ‚ÄúGood‚Äù Khoa‚Äôs lips curl into that familiar grin and he transfers Danny from his arms and into Bruce‚Äôs not even bothering to hide his chuckle when Bruce begins to purr in that rumbly bass and nuzzle his cheek against the top of the pup‚Äôs head. Pressing a short kiss to Bruce‚Äôs lips Khoa quickly pulls away with a smirk earning a grumble from Bruce.  ‚Äúand don‚Äôt be so grumpy. Your pheromones will set the puppy off‚Äù,2024-07-08 00:43:58 GMT

'eh its a problem for future me if i decide go make this an ongoing thing'],writing-on-eafv23,i have a lot of ideas for A/B/O stuff but i can‚Äôt deny myself fluffy Grandpa Bruce    INCLUDES: A/B/O there not really much of Danny in this because he‚Äôs sleeping but he is here! light Bruce x Minhkhoa implied Bruce x others (Selina Talia Harvey etc.) Danny is de-aged in this (up to your interpretation but i was writing this imagining Danny was like 5) Omega Bruce Beta Minhkhoa Jason is mentioned Omega Jason a few spelling and grammar mistakes It was late when I was writing this   &lt;!-- more --&gt;   ‚ÄúYou never told me you had a new puppy‚Äù The familiar voice of Khoa sounds from beside Bruce had he been any less distracted with trying to babyproof the hallway he would have noticed Khoa creeping up behind him with Danny in his arms bundled up in a blanket they all had scented. Danny‚Äôs lack of any scent even a personal scent had made their pack instincts go into a tizzy so they took turns rubbing a blanket against their scent glands so at the very least their scent would rub off on Danny while Jason was making a safer safehouse to raise his new puppy. Honestly if it were up to Bruce Jason and Danny would be locked in the manor where they can be properly cared for and doted on by the pack but Bruce knew better than to interfere with a very hormonal very broody first-time Omega parent. Bruce practically bristles at the sight of Minhkhoa someone who (although he does have a situationship with) is not part of their pack holding his new grandpup. All this earns from the Beta is a chuckle ignoring Bruce‚Äôs warning growls.   ‚ÄúAnd such a cute one too look at those little fangs‚Äù Khoa coos drawing attention to how the little pup was gnawing at Khoa‚Äôs fingers as he slept leaving little indents in the brown skin. It wasn‚Äôt often Khoa was soft. Even with his own adoptive son Phanton-One Khoa saw the boy more as a project and a way to one-up Bruce than an actual son. So to see Khoa genuinely coo over a pup was‚Ä¶ odd and Bruce ignored the way it made his heart flutter slightly. However Bruce‚Äôs growls return with twice the strength when Khoa sniffs at Danny‚Äôs scent gland or rather lack thereof. Minhkhoa quirks an eyebrow under his mask when he notices the lack of scent pulling his face back  ‚ÄúPup‚Äôs got a weird smell though where‚Äôd you pick this one up from Brucie?‚Äù  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me that‚Äù Bruce replies curtly returning to placing silicone protectors on the corner of the decorative table in the hallway trying and failing to ignore how Khoa was holding Danny so gently. ‚ÄúDanny was found wandering the streets at night. He has no records no documents no missing posters not even a birth certificate. And he‚Äôs my grandpup not my puppy‚Äù  ‚ÄúSo one of yours claimed the first orphan child they saw it seems your adoption habits are contagious‚Äù Khoa always did have him pinned though that‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôve been rivals with somebody for so long.  ‚ÄúHn.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ‚Äòhn‚Äô me. Tonight was supposed to be our date night!‚Äù Comes Khoas‚Äôs complaint his voice almost whiney though he quiets down when Danny whimpers in his sleep which prompts a deep growl from Bruce that makes the Beta snicker. ‚ÄúBut I GUESS since you are SO busy with the new grandpuppy we can reschedule‚Ä¶ but you owe me two dates next month‚Äù  ‚ÄúHmn.‚Äù It‚Äôs a fair ultimatum more time to get the new pup properly scented and used to the manor and then he gets to have two date nights Bruce just hopes the others won‚Äôt get jealous. It‚Äôs hard to juggle multiple situationships but Bruce (somehow) manages to make it work.  ‚ÄúGood‚Äù Khoa‚Äôs lips curl into that familiar grin and he transfers Danny from his arms and into Bruce‚Äôs not even bothering to hide his chuckle when Bruce begins to purr in that rumbly bass and nuzzle his cheek against the top of the pup‚Äôs head. Pressing a short kiss to Bruce‚Äôs lips Khoa quickly pulls away with a smirk earning a grumble from Bruce.  ‚Äúand don‚Äôt be so grumpy. Your pheromones will set the puppy off‚Äù,2024-07-08 00:43:58 GMT

Word count: 14k  Requested? No.  General masterlist         Yandere!Batman who is very VERY extremely lonely touch starved and grim. He‚Äôs also very unlucky apparently.     &lt;!-- more --&gt; He never even met Dick. Sure he heard about what happened to The Flying Graysons investigated it even but he‚Äôs only seem him on pictures videos or in passing but he wasn‚Äôt there that night he never talked to him or maybe he did while stopping him from killing Zuko either way never adopted him our boy went straight to orphanage and was adopted shortly after by a normal and loving family.     Actually this universe‚Äôs Bruce never met nor connected with ANY of his children all he had was Alfred and yet‚Ä¶ Something happened and‚Ä¶     Safe to say it‚Äôs been long never ending harsh years.     The only thing this Bruce knows is pain loneliness and misery. Don‚Äôt talk to him about Alfred. Maybe he can‚Äôt even look at pictures. When he realized he couldn‚Äôt remember his voice anymore‚Ä¶ He WON‚ÄôT watch videos or listen to audio of him. Yes Alfred being gone was one more trauma to the list of traumas he will carry on his tense and burdened shoulders for the rest of his helpless existence.     This Bruce is a loser closer to madness than any version of Bruce (aside from Batman who laughs). His Gotham is nearing it‚Äôs doom. He didn‚Äôt join the Justice League because of his level of emotional masochism pride and lack of will to get back on his feet. He is so used to suffering he thinks it‚Äôs possible to die if he doesn‚Äôt have such bitter companion. Safe to say he is depressed. And hyperfocused on saving a city he‚Äôs been working in for decades too blind by his grieving to see that he is not doing the right things. There is no social projects on Wayne Enterprises or Wayne Foundation to help people he neglected the company decades ago. He is almost becoming Michael Keaton‚Äôs Batman in The Flash.     Somehow one day he is sent to another universe. It can be through some disaster like Crisis in Infinite Earths or some villain who wanted different variants of heros to fight amongst themselves to death doesn‚Äôt really matter here what‚Äôs important is that he (after years of being a hermit on his cave) interacts with people more specifically he interacts with himself.     Or definitely a lucky version of himself. Maybe the luckiest. He is jealous.     During the whole event they interact and imagine how he felt when he found out that this other Batman has an Alfred. And he is so successful that he is a billionaire who uses his money to help Gotham get better (or as good as we know Gotham can get). Oh and he has a spouse. And children. Plural. So many he lost count. And pets. Two dogs one cat a cow (?) a turkey (a what now?) and a fREAKING DRAGON BAT (WHAT THA FUCK IS EVEN THAT????!?!?????!).      He is also more put together (looks like he showers and doesn‚Äôt skip meals). And less temperamental.     Okay‚Ä¶     Bruce is confused. When he comes back to his universe with a spark of hope in his heart he does his research. He could start actually making effort on his company and thus helping Gotham maybe even be good enough as a vigilant that he could join the Justice League and make some friends (even if the other Bruce was just as stoic he was the only one who could see on his micro expressions while talking about them how fond he was of his colleagues and how much he thrusts them even with his trust issues).      He could find those damn kids and adopt them. Find the one who somehow managed to make him open up enough for a relationship.     (He could also just work on his company philanthropism do some therapy make some new organic connections or whatever).     He is VERY disappointed to find out that some of those so called kids and are already adults have lived their whole lives without him maybe some have been arrested or even dead they have their whole lives and families that have NOTHING to do with him. Some don‚Äôt even exist (the only explanation for not a single clue in months of research). And his partner Reader is either living their own life that doesn‚Äôt allow space for him or also dead. He lost his timing. He is old and lost his timing. He is alone. He shouldn‚Äôt have hoped so much that he got blind by the improbability of the small chance. The other Batman did mention that his family started growing decades ago.      He just lost another family. This one he never got to have. He wishes he never knew about them.     He hyperfocused on them for months for nothing (hey It was hard to find info on the ones that don‚Äôt live a very civilian legal life like Cassandra or the ones that never even existed like Damian or the ones that are dead ‚Äî again maybe Cassandra or perhaps Jason. Maybe Jason joined a gang just for survival or something like that life on the streets is harsh and he is not very lucky. And I‚Äôm not even being specific on what could have happened to every single one of the batfam. Also Tim is probably a CEO right now). No connection and family will come from all of that. Especially because he is greedy starved he doesn‚Äôt want bits and pieces he wants it ALL. He wants that other Bruce‚Äôs life.     Yandere!Batman is born. He drowns and gets drunk on the pit of his own madness and he can‚Äôt get out of it. Doesn‚Äôt want to.     He could‚Ä¶ He could get rid of the people on their lives brainwash them and make them a happy family. They aren‚Äôt vigilantes they don‚Äôt have his abilities they don‚Äôt have his intellect it won‚Äôt be hard.     Of course Batman doesn‚Äôt kill but this Batman is looking for a change.     But they aren‚Äôt what lucky-billionaire-put-together Bruce had.      Don‚Äôt get me wrong. He is not just petty and jealous nor resents Bruce for his privileges and better decisions or whatever.      Okay maybe a little. Why? Just why ones life was perfect (hello? Didn‚Äôt you hear the part where he told you his own problems? Not even about the DEAD RESURRECTED CRIME LORD SON?) while the others had to draw the short stick?     But majorly he is just desperate foaming at the mouth for a happy ending and projected all of that on that poor random bat.      Now enough brooding back to solutions.     He could clone them.     Could work. Not exactly easy but he could just hack onto Luthor archives until he found how he cloned Superman and made that Superboy Superman or whatever he goes by now.      Again not the same as the original ones. The ones he craves. The ones he wants.     Alfred is screaming in his grave about how Bruce please needs to realize that no one will fill the expectations he puts on them not even the ‚Äúoriginal ones‚Äù.     Another hard but better fitted solution is to‚Ä¶ Simply‚Ä¶ Find a way to go to that other universe or one similar enough stalk and study their whole lives until he can perfectly replicate ‚Äúlucky‚Äù Bruce‚Äôs persona and just‚Ä¶ Get rid of him and take his place. Hello Alfred hello honey hello kids daddy‚Äôs home.     Looks like he finally got luck on his side maybe the sun will rise tomorrow.     Yandere!Bruce won‚Äôt just brush aside that he is rusty and definitely not a better Batman then the other one but he‚Äôs got time. He will developt patience. But can he learn enough to trick his perfect vigilant kids though? Is he seriously thinking straight? I mean the batkids are dope though. They learned from the best. As a proud (wannabe) father he knows they will be better than him one day perhaps already are.     How much of watching their lives everything that he craves can he take until he snaps? How much of watching Bruce‚Äôs interactions with them can he take? He swears he won‚Äôt take them for granted when he has them he will take care of them protect them be a family be happy.     Can he really keep his distance?     Looks like another supervillain just arrived in Gotham for the batfamily to battle against he is quite persistent though.

She stood simply unbothered as Tim talked about the gag gift he had gotten for Bruce something to make fun of his age but still thoughtful enough to be considered a gift. On the surface she appeared unbothered laughing along with Tim about the gift but Damian could see that she was anxious and saddened. He however didn‚Äôt know why.    &quot;It is a decent Gift Tim&quot;  ‚ÄúDecent? It‚Äôs hilarious.‚Äù Tim says as he continues to wrap the gift   ‚ÄúYour Gray Ghost memorabilia was more thoughtful.&quot;   &quot;Jason‚Äôs Idea. I just chipped in and wrapped it.&quot;   &quot;We‚Äôll take our leave. I‚Äôll inform the other to stay out.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDont. Dick will come running in like a sneaky kid.‚Äù Tim said‚Äú I‚Äôd rather not fend off a grown man like a toddler.‚Äù  Asta laughed at that. Despite being the oldest Dick often acted like the youngest of Bruce‚Äôs kids. As endearing as it was it was also annoying.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre anxious‚Äù Damian said as they stepped out of the library leaving Tim. ‚Äú Care to tell me why?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean to project-‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt but I can still see it on your face body and silences.‚Äù He takes her hand in his squeezing it gently.‚Äú You‚Äôre unwell.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou all do a lot of gifts. I swear I counted two dozen under your tree already and you plan to put more down there.&quot;   They strolled down the hall stopping in front of a bay window. &quot;Well there are many of us and the things under the tree that aren‚Äôt just random. Some of it is things we need like new gear and weapons that we haven‚Äôt gotten for ourselves yet. Also Father likes to overcompensate for all his wrongdoings throughout the year. What is a gift if not to show how much one cares and pays attention? The perfect gift.‚Äù  Damian smiles as he remembers his father standing at the door trying to get all the packages before any of his children. And his secret trips to the stores. He‚Äôd be damn if the paparazzi spoiled his gifts.   ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything under your tree‚Äù he looked at her and continued ‚Äú I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù She pulled her hands away. ‚Äú Maybe I should go. Allow your family to have your holiday without me burdening you.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAsta‚Äù  ‚ÄúI can go to your apartment.&quot; Your apartment?  &quot;Asta‚Äù  ‚ÄúOr one of the centers to help out. They always need extra hands.‚Äù  ‚ÄúASTA. I want you here. I want to spend Christmas with you. This will be our first Christmas together.‚Äù He takes both her hands in his. ‚ÄúPlease stay?‚Äù  ‚ÄúDAMIAN&quot;   Suddenly her hands are gone and so is she. All that remains is a pile of clothing and the faint buzzing that fades away.   &quot;Hey Damian‚Äù Dick says as he places a hand on his shoulder ‚Äú Where did Asta go?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù  Dick put his hands up in surrender at the sound of anger in his voice.   ‚ÄúBruce wants us in the cave. Apparently someone has something played for the holidays; nothing good though.‚Äù  -  Damian was semi-paying attention but most of his thoughts were elsewhere on Asta. The debriefing was long but nonsense. More activities were happening at the docks including drug and weapons trafficking. Black Mask and Penguin were both involved but to which and to what extent was still a debate. They were all to watch the dock and the crime lords.   ‚ÄúMay I speak?‚Äù Damian spoke before anyone could leave; they all groaned but sat back down nonetheless. ‚ÄúI would like for us to tone down our celebration this year. Specifically the gift giving.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo presents why?‚Äù Stephanie asked in dramatic shock.   ‚ÄúNo I just want it to be toned down. Decrease the amount of gifts. You can pass the off individual on a later day.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Bruce asked confused as the others.   ‚ÄúAsta‚Äù he says softly. ‚Äú She has nothing to give-‚Äù  ‚ÄúThen take her shopping. I‚Äôm sure there is something she can get at the last minute. We don‚Äôt care.‚Äù Tim says offering a solution to the question so he can leave.  ‚Äú This is last minute. Christmas Eve is tomorrow. How did she not know?‚Äù Dick asked. The trees bright lights and Christmas carols  ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt celebrate the holidays. This will be her first official Christmas.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve known her how long? And this is her first official Christmas. What have you been doing?‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt like receiving gifts when she knows she can‚Äôt give anything in return. I usually bring her a plate of food and blankets and spend the day after Christmas with her.‚Äù Well at least they solved the mystery of the day after Christmas with Damian and extra food with Alfred.   ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt see you. Just don‚Äôt take her shopping‚Äù Tim says   ‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt take our money to buy us gifts. She won‚Äôt.‚Äù Jason Saw Tim opening his mouth again. ‚Äú She has no money no home hell the clothes currently on her back aren‚Äôt even hers. She already feels like she owes us.‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt -‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut she does. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs constantly helping Alfred always cleaning or tucking herself into the smallest corner or in Damian‚Äôs room when she can‚Äôt. You can take someone from nothing from the streets and expect them not to feel suspicious or like they owe you. On the streets everything is an exchange.‚Äù  Jason knows this. Jason lived this. He had been in her shoes at one point. He constantly worked and was on his best behavior just to stay in this manner fearing every action would have consequences. It wasn‚Äôt until his adoption that the fear disappeared. That he thought himself worth.   ‚ÄúI bet she saw a present or more with her name on it. The idea of presents won‚Äôt upset her but for her specifically and she had nothing to return. Yeah that would be upsetting.‚Äù It was moments like these where the family was reminded that Jason himself had spent time on their streets and that Jason himself had at one point been homeless. While Jason often took pride in being from Crime Alley he never really spoke of his time in its cold.   ‚ÄúNo gifts?‚Äù Cassandra asked   ‚ÄúTwo gifts each‚Äù was still a considerably large number‚Äú and all the gifts with Asta‚Äôs name on them should be removed. You can all exchange your other gifts at a later date.‚Äù Bruce gave the order and everyone began to move.  ‚ÄúJason‚Äù Damian called for him to stay back. The others left and Bruce stayed to work on the computer eavesdrop. ‚Äú Your gift can stay under the tree. It‚Äôs the one thing I know she‚Äôll appreciate.  -  Early Christmas morning   3 am   She was jealous you Damian could sleep so peacefully while she couldn‚Äôt even close her eyes. She lay awake listening to the silences and watching time go by. Eventually she could not take anymore so she shifted into a serpent and slipped from Damian‚Äôs hold slithering to the door and underneath. She turned human in the hall and made her way to the nearest window. Cracking it home she slipped out and took flight as a snow owl. Hoping the clouds would clear her mind.   Hours later Asta returns. Upon her return she finds the kitchen light on. Being polite she knocks on the kitchen door before opening it and sticks her head in it.   ‚Äù It‚Äôs a bit early and cold to be outside no?‚Äú Alfred asked as he looked at the clock hanging on the wall which read 6:17 am.  &quot;I couldn‚Äôt sleep so I took a flight‚Äù Asta said as she stepped into the kitchen closing the door tightly behind her and stopping the cold from getting in. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing up so early? &quot;   &quot;Cooking‚Äù Alfred said as he pulled more ingredients out of the fridge.   ‚ÄúDo they have an early morning?‚Äù she stepped to the counter seeing everything splayed about.  ‚ÄúNo but it is Christmas and dinner tends to be more special during the holidays so more prep and time is needed. Plus Breakfast and Lunch in between.‚Äù Alfred explained as he checked one of the ovens that held the Ham.   ‚ÄúDo you do this all by yourself?‚Äù she asked as she found a bookmarked with dozens of recipes on the counter.   ‚ÄúJason will assist with after breakfast.&quot; Jason was the only other person Alfred trusted in the kitchen. He had no bad history of burning or breaking anything. But he also needed his rest after patrolling so he only accepted assistance after breakfast giving him time to rest.   &quot;Can I help?‚Äù Asta asked shyly. ‚ÄúI would ‚Ä¶ I would like to help you make your family dinner.‚Äù After all they had given and done for her it was the least she could do. She could never give them gifts but the least she could make their family dinner. Gift them a warm meal just like Damian had for her every year since.   ‚ÄúOur family‚Äù she looked at him confused. ‚Äú Our family dinner.&quot; Alfred pulls out something from a drawer and hands it to her. It is a long dark blue apron dress. It is then Asta remembers that she is naked. Before she can even apologize Alfred shakes his head (Damian has already explained her displeasure with clothes. And while he understands he will not allow her to cook in the nude).  ‚Äù You can start with the chopping.‚Äú a cutting board and knife were placed on the counter.   &quot;Thank you‚Äù it was a load of thanks but they weren‚Äôt going to unpack. He knew what she meant and what she was grateful for. He knew. He always knew.,2024-07-08 02:08:23 GMT

Word count: 14k  Requested? No.  General masterlist         Yandere!Batman who is very VERY extremely lonely touch starved and grim. He‚Äôs also very unlucky apparently.     &lt;!-- more --&gt; He never even met Dick. Sure he heard about what happened to The Flying Graysons investigated it even but he‚Äôs only seem him on pictures videos or in passing but he wasn‚Äôt there that night he never talked to him or maybe he did while stopping him from killing Zuko either way never adopted him our boy went straight to orphanage and was adopted shortly after by a normal and loving family.     Actually this universe‚Äôs Bruce never met nor connected with ANY of his children all he had was Alfred and yet‚Ä¶ Something happened and‚Ä¶     Safe to say it‚Äôs been long never ending harsh years.     The only thing this Bruce knows is pain loneliness and misery. Don‚Äôt talk to him about Alfred. Maybe he can‚Äôt even look at pictures. When he realized he couldn‚Äôt remember his voice anymore‚Ä¶ He WON‚ÄôT watch videos or listen to audio of him. Yes Alfred being gone was one more trauma to the list of traumas he will carry on his tense and burdened shoulders for the rest of his helpless existence.     This Bruce is a loser closer to madness than any version of Bruce (aside from Batman who laughs). His Gotham is nearing it‚Äôs doom. He didn‚Äôt join the Justice League because of his level of emotional masochism pride and lack of will to get back on his feet. He is so used to suffering he thinks it‚Äôs possible to die if he doesn‚Äôt have such bitter companion. Safe to say he is depressed. And hyperfocused on saving a city he‚Äôs been working in for decades too blind by his grieving to see that he is not doing the right things. There is no social projects on Wayne Enterprises or Wayne Foundation to help people he neglected the company decades ago. He is almost becoming Michael Keaton‚Äôs Batman in The Flash.     Somehow one day he is sent to another universe. It can be through some disaster like Crisis in Infinite Earths or some villain who wanted different variants of heros to fight amongst themselves to death doesn‚Äôt really matter here what‚Äôs important is that he (after years of being a hermit on his cave) interacts with people more specifically he interacts with himself.     Or definitely a lucky version of himself. Maybe the luckiest. He is jealous.     During the whole event they interact and imagine how he felt when he found out that this other Batman has an Alfred. And he is so successful that he is a billionaire who uses his money to help Gotham get better (or as good as we know Gotham can get). Oh and he has a spouse. And children. Plural. So many he lost count. And pets. Two dogs one cat a cow (?) a turkey (a what now?) and a fREAKING DRAGON BAT (WHAT THA FUCK IS EVEN THAT????!?!?????!).      He is also more put together (looks like he showers and doesn‚Äôt skip meals). And less temperamental.     Okay‚Ä¶     Bruce is confused. When he comes back to his universe with a spark of hope in his heart he does his research. He could start actually making effort on his company and thus helping Gotham maybe even be good enough as a vigilant that he could join the Justice League and make some friends (even if the other Bruce was just as stoic he was the only one who could see on his micro expressions while talking about them how fond he was of his colleagues and how much he thrusts them even with his trust issues).      He could find those damn kids and adopt them. Find the one who somehow managed to make him open up enough for a relationship.     (He could also just work on his company philanthropism do some therapy make some new organic connections or whatever).     He is VERY disappointed to find out that some of those so called kids and are already adults have lived their whole lives without him maybe some have been arrested or even dead they have their whole lives and families that have NOTHING to do with him. Some don‚Äôt even exist (the only explanation for not a single clue in months of research). And his partner Reader is either living their own life that doesn‚Äôt allow space for him or also dead. He lost his timing. He is old and lost his timing. He is alone. He shouldn‚Äôt have hoped so much that he got blind by the improbability of the small chance. The other Batman did mention that his family started growing decades ago.      He just lost another family. This one he never got to have. He wishes he never knew about them.     He hyperfocused on them for months for nothing (hey It was hard to find info on the ones that don‚Äôt live a very civilian legal life like Cassandra or the ones that never even existed like Damian or the ones that are dead ‚Äî again maybe Cassandra or perhaps Jason. Maybe Jason joined a gang just for survival or something like that life on the streets is harsh and he is not very lucky. And I‚Äôm not even being specific on what could have happened to every single one of the batfam. Also Tim is probably a CEO right now). No connection and family will come from all of that. Especially because he is greedy starved he doesn‚Äôt want bits and pieces he wants it ALL. He wants that other Bruce‚Äôs life.     Yandere!Batman is born. He drowns and gets drunk on the pit of his own madness and he can‚Äôt get out of it. Doesn‚Äôt want to.     He could‚Ä¶ He could get rid of the people on their lives brainwash them and make them a happy family. They aren‚Äôt vigilantes they don‚Äôt have his abilities they don‚Äôt have his intellect it won‚Äôt be hard.     Of course Batman doesn‚Äôt kill but this Batman is looking for a change.     But they aren‚Äôt what lucky-billionaire-put-together Bruce had.      Don‚Äôt get me wrong. He is not just petty and jealous nor resents Bruce for his privileges and better decisions or whatever.      Okay maybe a little. Why? Just why ones life was perfect (hello? Didn‚Äôt you hear the part where he told you his own problems? Not even about the DEAD RESURRECTED CRIME LORD SON?) while the others had to draw the short stick?     But majorly he is just desperate foaming at the mouth for a happy ending and projected all of that on that poor random bat.      Now enough brooding back to solutions.     He could clone them.     Could work. Not exactly easy but he could just hack onto Luthor archives until he found how he cloned Superman and made that Superboy Superman or whatever he goes by now.      Again not the same as the original ones. The ones he craves. The ones he wants.     Alfred is screaming in his grave about how Bruce please needs to realize that no one will fill the expectations he puts on them not even the ‚Äúoriginal ones‚Äù.     Another hard but better fitted solution is to‚Ä¶ Simply‚Ä¶ Find a way to go to that other universe or one similar enough stalk and study their whole lives until he can perfectly replicate ‚Äúlucky‚Äù Bruce‚Äôs persona and just‚Ä¶ Get rid of him and take his place. Hello Alfred hello honey hello kids daddy‚Äôs home.     Looks like he finally got luck on his side maybe the sun will rise tomorrow.     Yandere!Bruce won‚Äôt just brush aside that he is rusty and definitely not a better Batman then the other one but he‚Äôs got time. He will developt patience. But can he learn enough to trick his perfect vigilant kids though? Is he seriously thinking straight? I mean the batkids are dope though. They learned from the best. As a proud (wannabe) father he knows they will be better than him one day perhaps already are.     How much of watching their lives everything that he craves can he take until he snaps? How much of watching Bruce‚Äôs interactions with them can he take? He swears he won‚Äôt take them for granted when he has them he will take care of them protect them be a family be happy.     Can he really keep his distance?     Looks like another supervillain just arrived in Gotham for the batfamily to battle against he is quite persistent though.

Maybe he was still that punk kid who didn‚Äôt even know if he was gonna make it through high school. Yet here he was a gargoyle on a skyscraper. Neo-Gotham was a multicolored maze from his perch. Everything had happened so fast. Somehow the metropolis below him had become his responsibility. Somehow he was here and he was Batman.  ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù He hadn‚Äôt heard anyone else on the rooftop until she spoke but the deep voice came from directly behind. It was sudden and curt. Part of him was terrified.  Terry whirled around. He first saw the bright yellow bat on her chest. The suit itself was almost identical to his despite the change in color although a midnight cape waved from her shoulders blotting out the bright lights of the city. He had heard of her. He wasn‚Äôt sure she was real. Granted the fact that Terry was wearing his own batsuit should have probably clued him in.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the Bat‚Äù Terry said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre real.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù she barked. ‚ÄúHow did you get Cardinal‚Äôs suit?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWho are you?!‚Äù she snapped.  He shifted back slightly at her sharp words a knot forming in his throat.  Suddenly Mr. Wayne‚Äôs voice rang through his ears ‚ÄúTell her that Bruce Wayne gave you the suit.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Terry whispered. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI need you to trust me McGinnis. Trust that I trust her.‚Äù  Terry cleared his throat slightly. ‚ÄúUh okay um Bruce Wayne gave the suit to me.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù The Bat looked off as though in thought. ‚ÄúBruce gave it to him.‚Äù She paused. ‚ÄúYou think I know?‚Äù Her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúCardinal?‚Äù Her gaze snapped back to Terry trapping his eyes in hers. ‚ÄúGive back the suit and leave this alone. This is not your city or business.‚Äù She turned her back to him ready to leave.  ‚ÄúWhat about Derek Powers?‚Äù Terry asked. ‚ÄúIs he your business? Because last I checked you aren‚Äôt doing anything about him.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù  She whirled around her cape whipping in the wind her presence towering over Terry. ‚ÄúYou are a child in a broken suit that Bruce should have never let leave the cave. Go home. Live.‚Äù  She was gone before he could reply a bat in the winds of Neo-Gotham. She was gone and Terry was left alone on the quiet rooftop.  After an eternity of silence Terry finally spoke ‚ÄúMr. Wayne should I come back to the cave?‚Äù There was no response. ‚ÄúMr. Wayne?‚Äù,2024-07-08 04:44:38 GMT

She‚Äôs been ALL IN since day one. She‚Äôs shown the most interest of any of Bruce‚Äôs kids and IS Batman in one future.   idk if they retconned that in the‚Ä¶not even reboot. Whatever we‚Äôre calling it. But her and Damian are the two that are into it and I‚Äôd argue Damian was basically groomed to want to inherit the mantle. I think left to his own devices he‚Äôd probably want something different. He seems to thrive when he can be his own person.   I know everyone including DC staff hyper focus on how Tim or Damian are mini Bruce‚Äôs and that‚Äôs not wrong but so is Cass. Just in a different way but she‚Äôs by far more married to Bruce‚Äôs ideals and morals than anyone else and she was already thinking that way before she even met the bat family. She really is his natural successor.   I know it‚Äôs not easy to see what with writers not knowing what to do with a female character that isn‚Äôt there to be sexy or manic pixie dreamgirl but I‚Äôd recommend looking at her old run. It‚Äôs got problems too but I think her character is fleshed out MUCH better. Some of it doesn‚Äôt hold up (like ‚Äúfixing‚Äù her disability etc.) but skimming for moments of characterization and back story and specifically her feelings about what Batman represents really makes it clear she‚Äôs Bruce‚Äôs successor if Batman has one.   For all we know mainline Bruce Batman might live forever *coughcough*  Edit: Sparrow brought up a great scene in the tags where Cass is professing her affinity for the Batman symbol-everything the bat represents-not Bruce or Babs specifically (they have a whole stupid conflict in the og run that I hate but the point is Cass is interested in making a positive difference not being loyal to a person).

Ok this might have spoilers so be careful if you haven‚Äôt read the chapter yet.  I won‚Äôt do these kind of post to often but when reading this chapter urgh.  Hi everyone  Sorry I am late to the game so here are my thoughts on the latest chapter. ^.^  Un-constructive thoughts:  ARRRRRGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! This chapter Oh My God!!!!!!!!! So much drama!!!!!! (*cries of anguish*)  I can already tell that the next few chapters are going to have my heart smashed!!!!!  First of all yay Duke is ok (he is still alive) but good grief he is hurting bad!  But I want to redirect to the main issue here: Bruce‚Ä¶. let the kids and Barbara help!!! Even if it‚Äôs recon on finding the location of Joker!!!!!  Kids! Don‚Äôt do anything crazy!!  Jason!!! Don‚Äôt do anything crazy!!!! I know you‚Äôre the loose cannon and that doesn‚Äôt follow the rules but don‚Äôt go off by yourself!!!!! Especially with Joker running around!!!!  Now more constructive thoughts:  These are idle thoughts that immediately came to mind when I read the chapter so I can be wrong and this is me trying to organize my thoughts. I can be wrong about this so please don‚Äôt take this too seriously please.  One thing that Tim brought up how the frick did Joker escape Arkham without setting off the alarms? Joker‚Äôs MO is normally a parade of chaos out the front door. He wants Bats to know he is out and chaos is raining down upon Gotham. Joker is not a quiet villain.  A few thoughts have come to mind:  Joker had a inside man letting him loose. This was a planned escape by an outside 3 party to distract Batman This may be a fake or decoy Joker. These are just a few thoughts that have come to mind I have been watching videos of Joker lately and one of the clips I‚Äôve seen that Joker has his own sidekick that is going to take the mantle of Joker (I am talking about Batman the Brave and the Bold).  We haven‚Äôt seen the design of Joker in this series so I am leaning more on 1. He had an inside man to get him out of there quietly.  This could be a henchman or he could have something on one of the doctors or guards.,2024-07-08 05:15:16 GMT

12,Batman,['cassandra cain'  'terry mcginnis'  'fanfic'  'batman beyond'],27-squirrels-in-a-trenchcoat,The Bat and her Cardinal (introduction) The red bat on Terry‚Äôs chest was the symbol of a legend a legacy that he wasn‚Äôt sure if he deserved. Maybe he was still that punk kid who didn‚Äôt even know if he was gonna make it through high school. Yet here he was a gargoyle on a skyscraper. Neo-Gotham was a multicolored maze from his perch. Everything had happened so fast. Somehow the metropolis below him had become his responsibility. Somehow he was here and he was Batman.  ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù He hadn‚Äôt heard anyone else on the rooftop until she spoke but the deep voice came from directly behind. It was sudden and curt. Part of him was terrified.  Terry whirled around. He first saw the bright yellow bat on her chest. The suit itself was almost identical to his despite the change in color although a midnight cape waved from her shoulders blotting out the bright lights of the city. He had heard of her. He wasn‚Äôt sure she was real. Granted the fact that Terry was wearing his own batsuit should have probably clued him in.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the Bat‚Äù Terry said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre real.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù she barked. ‚ÄúHow did you get Cardinal‚Äôs suit?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWho are you?!‚Äù she snapped.  He shifted back slightly at her sharp words a knot forming in his throat.  Suddenly Mr. Wayne‚Äôs voice rang through his ears ‚ÄúTell her that Bruce Wayne gave you the suit.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Terry whispered. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI need you to trust me McGinnis. Trust that I trust her.‚Äù  Terry cleared his throat slightly. ‚ÄúUh okay um Bruce Wayne gave the suit to me.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù The Bat looked off as though in thought. ‚ÄúBruce gave it to him.‚Äù She paused. ‚ÄúYou think I know?‚Äù Her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúCardinal?‚Äù Her gaze snapped back to Terry trapping his eyes in hers. ‚ÄúGive back the suit and leave this alone. This is not your city or business.‚Äù She turned her back to him ready to leave.  ‚ÄúWhat about Derek Powers?‚Äù Terry asked. ‚ÄúIs he your business? Because last I checked you aren‚Äôt doing anything about him.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù  She whirled around her cape whipping in the wind her presence towering over Terry. ‚ÄúYou are a child in a broken suit that Bruce should have never let leave the cave. Go home. Live.‚Äù  She was gone before he could reply a bat in the winds of Neo-Gotham. She was gone and Terry was left alone on the quiet rooftop.  After an eternity of silence Terry finally spoke ‚ÄúMr. Wayne should I come back to the cave?‚Äù There was no response. ‚ÄúMr. Wayne?‚Äù,2024-07-08 04:44:38 GMT

21,Batman,['cassandra wayne'  'cassandra cain'  'i mean let‚Äôs be real batman will never actually be anyone else long term in the mainline comic'  'and he even becomes an immortal god with diana and clark in one universe'  'but i stand by cass as batman'  'i think damian will stay involved as will tim and the others but they won‚Äôt be the bat'],laughterbynight,I‚Äôm so confused   why do people suddenly think Cass doesn‚Äôt want to be Batman? She‚Äôs been ALL IN since day one. She‚Äôs shown the most interest of any of Bruce‚Äôs kids and IS Batman in one future.   idk if they retconned that in the‚Ä¶not even reboot. Whatever we‚Äôre calling it. But her and Damian are the two that are into it and I‚Äôd argue Damian was basically groomed to want to inherit the mantle. I think left to his own devices he‚Äôd probably want something different. He seems to thrive when he can be his own person.   I know everyone including DC staff hyper focus on how Tim or Damian are mini Bruce‚Äôs and that‚Äôs not wrong but so is Cass. Just in a different way but she‚Äôs by far more married to Bruce‚Äôs ideals and morals than anyone else and she was already thinking that way before she even met the bat family. She really is his natural successor.   I know it‚Äôs not easy to see what with writers not knowing what to do with a female character that isn‚Äôt there to be sexy or manic pixie dreamgirl but I‚Äôd recommend looking at her old run. It‚Äôs got problems too but I think her character is fleshed out MUCH better. Some of it doesn‚Äôt hold up (like ‚Äúfixing‚Äù her disability etc.) but skimming for moments of characterization and back story and specifically her feelings about what Batman represents really makes it clear she‚Äôs Bruce‚Äôs successor if Batman has one.   For all we know mainline Bruce Batman might live forever *coughcough*  Edit: Sparrow brought up a great scene in the tags where Cass is professing her affinity for the Batman symbol-everything the bat represents-not Bruce or Babs specifically (they have a whole stupid conflict in the og run that I hate but the point is Cass is interested in making a positive difference not being loyal to a person).  Also she‚Äôs been a daddy‚Äôs girl since the moment they met let‚Äôs be real. Bruce is such a girl dad too.,2024-07-08 05:44:19 GMT

At least now.   The redhead nods ‚ÄúSure ask away I‚Äôll answer everything I can.‚Äù Then she notices Batman reaching to touch the green shield and makes a soft warning noise ‚ÄúAh sorry please don‚Äôt touch it. I can show how it works later but it‚Äôs not meant to keep you out. It‚Äôs to keep everything else in.‚Äù  Batman reluctantly puts his head down and turns to her.   ‚ÄúElaborate.‚Äù  The sci-fi ship in the air makes a loud hissing sound like compressed air being released and the bottom part of it slides open. Jazz nods in the direction of the now open ship.   ‚ÄúYou know what they say it‚Äôs better to see it once than to hear it ten times.‚Äù  There are three humanoid figures standing in there. All of them are mostly monochrome black and white clothes starkling white hair. They look like one adult and two children but it‚Äôs one of the kids who raises his hands to his mouth and yells so loud everyone in three miles radius is able to hear him:  ‚ÄúStep away from the shield please shit‚Äôs about to get real!‚Äù   None of the heroes move but Jazz does take a few steps away. Wonder Woman after a moment of hesitation follows her example.   A mechanical voice comes from the ship itself ‚ÄúCountdown to the breach. Five‚Ä¶ Four‚Ä¶‚Äù  On ‚Äòthree‚Äô all three of the monochrome figures step out from the ship. But before any of the heroes have time to worry they all float in the air undeterred by gravity and the ship door closes behind them.   The countdown reaches &#x27;one‚Äô. And in the next moment it looks like the hell breaks loose.   Countless giant vines shoot out from the portal up reaching for the ship. True to what the red hoverboarder said they are very much toothy every vine splitting in two and attempting to bite the ship like some twisted idea of scissors.   None of them reach it.   The oldest of three kids claps his hands and a wall of raging fire descends on the vines throwing them off. In the next moment the trio falls apart flying through the lovecraftian mess of carnivorous plants with practiced ease the younger ones using what looks like icicles and little storms.   ‚ÄúWho are they?‚Äù Batman asks Jazz following the youngest one‚Äôs - the only girl among the three - movements as she creates a strong gust of wind with a wave of her hand. None of the vines or attacks get past the shield though.   ‚ÄúMy siblings‚Äù the girl answers pointing her hand at the oldest one ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Dan. He‚Äôs the most violent. One time he destroyed our original world but that timeline doesn‚Äôt exist anymore.‚Äù She then points to the girl ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Dani the youngest. She rarely joins the crew lately. And she is actually a clone but at this point most of us have been cloned once or twice so it‚Äôs not a big deal anymore.‚Äù She then points her finger to the last one a boy that flies past them quicker than a lightning freezing everything he touches ‚ÄúAnd this is Danny. He is the most powerful one. Technically he could have just ended the fight with one Wail but kids like to have fun. Also they don‚Äôt get to show off their elemental powers a lot so they are mostly being dramatic for you.‚Äù  She says all this so easily just like a matter of fact and it is at this moment that the members of JL realize the sheer power of whoever these people are. When she casually told them she bested Superman it could have been written as a coincidence a joke. But this?  Dan growls as one of the vines scratches his shoulder. He bleeds green but it‚Äôs only for a second before both the wound and the suit knit themselves back together. This is not just a simple accelerated healing it almost looks like a miracle.   ‚ÄúOi brats I‚Äôm done with show off get out of the way!‚Äù He yells at the other two and Danny and Dani quickly follow the order flying closer to him and behind his back.   ‚ÄúCover your ears‚Äù Jazz tells the heroes around her and puts her helmet back on as Dan takes a deep breath and screams.   It hurts even those who follow Jazz‚Äôs advice. Batman feels like his eardrums are about to be shattered for the lack of better word. But the vines like the sonic attack even less - most of them subdue and pull back inside the portal and the rest is dissipating like they are being burned from the inside out.   And then just like it began the scream - the wail - stops. The silence feels deafening after the end of it but slowly the sounds return and the JL watches Danny flying down to the center of the portal. He puts his hands on the surface of it and for a long moment nothing happens.   And then the Pit starts closing up.   Or no it is Danny who absorbs it the green flowing up through his hands his veins that start glowing the same green. His eyes become the same toxic color with no whites and no irises just glowing green all over and his hair shimmers like stars.   A few minutes later the portal is gone like it never even existed and Danny plants his feet on the ground and stretches like one would do after a good rest.   ‚ÄúOof that was nice!‚Äù He turns to the other two who are still up in the air ‚ÄúDo you want some?‚Äù   Dan flips him off before going back to the ship but Dani floats down to him and extends her hands out.   ‚ÄúSure. I like getting it from you better than from the portal itself anyway. Gives it a sparkling taste like Sprite‚Äù she chuckles. Danny takes her hands in his and the green glow slowly makes its way through their joined palms now flowing through the girl‚Äôs body.   ‚ÄúWhat are they?‚Äù Flash whispers horrified but Jazz hears it nonetheless and turns her head to him taking her helmet off once again.   ‚ÄúThat is not a very appropriate question‚Äù she chastises and smiles at their faces ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs okay I get it. They are ghosts. Or ectoplasmic entities or halfas or highly liminal beings. Or if you want a very simplified version they are dead kids who are enjoying their afterlife a little too much.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDead?‚Äù Batman zeros on the word snapping his eyes at the girl. She smiles and for the first time it doesn‚Äôt look human. Her teeth are too sharp her grin too wide and her eyes are suddenly not just teal but neon bright and glowing with vertical irises.   ‚ÄúMost of us are dead in one way or another. And I do not mean it in a metaphorical sense.‚Äù  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-  What I‚Äôm thinking is they have a whole system going on. Amity Park generally resides in the Realms but from time to time they decide they want to go on a vacation as a whole town and they pop into existence on one of the Earths. They don‚Äôt really care for the universe or dimension they end up in as long as it is more or less peaceful (as in no active wars going on right where they pop up) has sunlight and nice weather.   The GIW is taking care of legal things - imagine US government reaction when a whole ass town just boom starts existing in a place where nothing existed before? So GIW does all the paperwork and discussions. Also they are doing their basic research on the dimension they end up in for science purposes.   I‚Äôm thinking Vlad is still a mayor of Amity. And sometimes when a particular dimension is rather annoying he straight up possesses the authorities because he hates official talks and couldn‚Äôt care less for morals if he tried for a week. The GIW scolds him but don‚Äôt really say no. It‚Äôs not a good solution to the problem but hey it works.  Meanwhile Fentons are doing ectoplasmic research. They scan the dimension for troubles basically looking for natural portals and ghosts causing ruckus. Jazz is almost always the one who does the talking to the heroes native to the dimension - she is the one who has the most patience and social skills. Jack is in charge of transportation and Maddie is the head of biological ecto-biological and other species research. Tucker is the tech specialist of course - he is the sole reason why Amity has wi-fi wherever they go. Val and her father are kind of protectors? Security? But for the whole town yeah. They do have GIW agents as subordinates.   Dani is not always living in Amity she travels the Realms most of the time but she joins when something interesting happens. Dan is like on an eternal probation period GIW and Fentons keep an eye on him but he is one of the heavy hitters for when shit goes down.   Danny is living his best life he is mainly the protector spirit of Amity but he also gets to protect all the dimensions from ghosts! He helps anyone and everyone - one day he is working with Val on defenses for their main ship they use to travel inside dimensions and the next day he is joining Maddie in her studies of new species found.   Oh I forgot Sam. She is probably the one responsible for the magic stuff - mostly everyone else focuses on scientific aspects but she is the one to research on occult things.      |  |,2024-07-08 09:45:38 GMT

Reader) Jason Todd. But you always new him as jay. You were around 10 when you saw a small boy around 11 steeling tires of an old car in the dump. ‚ÄúHay! You this is my place back off!‚Äù You say to him ‚Äúho sorry kid but I need these if I want to eat tonight‚Äù the strange boy said picking up the tires. ‚ÄúIt will cost you!‚Äù You say just as he is about to walk off. ‚ÄúYeah ok fair point. What you need kid?‚Äù He asked walking towards you. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt give you money though! I have a cigarette?‚Äù He said jokingly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 10 and a half! Plus I don‚Äôt want money.‚Äù You say with a hand on your hip. ‚ÄúSo what do yo-I need something to eat!‚Äù You cut him off. ‚ÄúOh um ok I normally get a sandwich from a soup kitchen but they shut down‚Äù he signed putting down a tier and holding out his hand for you to shake. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll share what I can get from this. Ok?‚Äù He asked ‚Äúyes! Oh I‚Äôm y/n y/n L/n‚Äù you say ‚Äúnice to meet you y/n I‚Äôm Jason Todd but‚Ä¶around here I go by jay you should figure out a new name as well it‚Äôs safer like idk umm maybe Jen ?‚Äù ‚ÄúOk sure jen and jay sounds cool!‚Äù  after around three years you got to know him better and became his closest friend and had maybe kissed once or twice. But then he disappeared. Vanished. Like he was never there. Only a week after Jason‚Äôs disappearance you were descoverd and put into foster homes but avenchualy you met the Kent‚Äôs. Thay already had a son Conner and he instantly saw you as his baby sister. When you found out that your foster father was the superman you begged him to let you train to become his sidekick along side Conner! And one day he agreed! You were over the moon you may not of had powers but you were one heck of an engineer you had made rocket boots so you could keep up with your brother and dad and not to mention a total badass when it came to hand to hand combat. You were 14 when Bruce Wayne came to your home to ask you to enter the titans who really needed an engineer. ‚ÄúCan I? Please dad please?!‚Äù You practically begged him ‚Äúoh god fine but Bruce if I come round and see her with a fucking stab wound she comes home!‚Äù Clark made it very clear on that but the next thing you know you‚Äôre in the elevator with your dad and Bruce by your sides. When you step out every one is in the living room watching some murder mystery movie or something like that. ‚ÄúEveryone I would like you to meet y/n L/n - Kent.‚Äù Bruce said as he patted your shoulder. ‚ÄúOk I got to go be careful n/n‚Äù Clark said as he kissed your forehead before leaving. ‚ÄúHi everyone I‚Äôm your new engineer.‚Äù You say as everyone comes to meet you expect one a black haired blue eyed teen still sat watching the tv. ‚ÄúOmg hi I‚Äôm Rachael finally more teenage girls!‚Äù You smile at the girl and everyone comes to say hi and greets you. ‚ÄúJason.‚Äù Bruce calls out ‚Äúcome and introduce yourself‚Äù. ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm good thanks B much rather be here right now there about to enter crime alley!‚Äù Said the boy. You recognise the name Jason and his attitude towards everyone it was all familiar like you knew him from your childhood but didn‚Äôt know were. Dick when over and turned of the Tv to get Jason‚Äôs attention ‚Äúwhat the hell dickhead!?‚Äù He said standing up. ‚ÄúJason we all know you like crime alley but come meet new kid‚Äù they both walked over ‚Äúhi I‚Äôm y/n L/n - Kent nice to meet you‚Äù you said ‚ÄúJason Todd good to meet-wait L/n?‚Äù He asked you like he had remembered something. ‚ÄúUm yeah that‚Äôs me formally L/n now L/n - Kent‚Äù you said trying to explain you weren‚Äôt born a Kent. ‚ÄúNo you‚Äôre what‚Ä¶Jen? That‚Äôs your nickname right? Jen?‚Äù He asked ‚Äúyes it is- holy shit jay!?‚Äù You responded as he pulled you into a hug ‚ÄúI never thought I‚Äôd see you again!‚Äù Jason said still hugging you ‚Äúum what is going on?‚Äù Asked gar ‚Äúyeah not trying to reck the mood but do you know echother?‚Äù Kory asked ‚Äúum yeah we dated in crime alley‚Ä¶ speaking of which‚Äù you said pushing Jason off you. ‚ÄúWhere the hell did you go? You just left me i when to bye us some sandwiches and when I get back you we‚Äôre gone!‚Äù You said still holding his shoulder‚Äôs ‚ÄúI know I know Ieft you and I‚Äôm so sorry but um can we talk about this somewhere that isn‚Äôt in font of my dad?‚Äù He said with that stupid voice he used when you argued back a crime alley.  When everyone was getting ready for bed later you Hurd somebody knock on your door you opened it to see Jason ‚Äúhay babe can we talk?‚Äù You pulled him in pining him against the wall. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ‚Äòbabe‚Äô me you left that is by far the opposite of being a good boyfriend!‚Äùyou said you were about to carry on yelling at Jason but just as you opened your mouth he kissed you and you couldn‚Äôt help but kiss him back because in all truth no matter how angry you were at him you couldn‚Äôt help but miss how he kissed you how he used to play with your hair after you had nightmares or when he would play a old music tape on his VHS player that you when both dance and sing along to you had missed everything about him and in all honesty so did he.,2024-07-08 10:55:24 GMT

At least now.   The redhead nods ‚ÄúSure ask away I‚Äôll answer everything I can.‚Äù Then she notices Batman reaching to touch the green shield and makes a soft warning noise ‚ÄúAh sorry please don‚Äôt touch it. I can show how it works later but it‚Äôs not meant to keep you out. It‚Äôs to keep everything else in.‚Äù  Batman reluctantly puts his head down and turns to her.   ‚ÄúElaborate.‚Äù  The sci-fi ship in the air makes a loud hissing sound like compressed air being released and the bottom part of it slides open. Jazz nods in the direction of the now open ship.   ‚ÄúYou know what they say it‚Äôs better to see it once than to hear it ten times.‚Äù  There are three humanoid figures standing in there. All of them are mostly monochrome black and white clothes starkling white hair. They look like one adult and two children but it‚Äôs one of the kids who raises his hands to his mouth and yells so loud everyone in three miles radius is able to hear him:  ‚ÄúStep away from the shield please shit‚Äôs about to get real!‚Äù   None of the heroes move but Jazz does take a few steps away. Wonder Woman after a moment of hesitation follows her example.   A mechanical voice comes from the ship itself ‚ÄúCountdown to the breach. Five‚Ä¶ Four‚Ä¶‚Äù  On ‚Äòthree‚Äô all three of the monochrome figures step out from the ship. But before any of the heroes have time to worry they all float in the air undeterred by gravity and the ship door closes behind them.   The countdown reaches &#x27;one‚Äô. And in the next moment it looks like the hell breaks loose.   Countless giant vines shoot out from the portal up reaching for the ship. True to what the red hoverboarder said they are very much toothy every vine splitting in two and attempting to bite the ship like some twisted idea of scissors.   None of them reach it.   The oldest of three kids claps his hands and a wall of raging fire descends on the vines throwing them off. In the next moment the trio falls apart flying through the lovecraftian mess of carnivorous plants with practiced ease the younger ones using what looks like icicles and little storms.   ‚ÄúWho are they?‚Äù Batman asks Jazz following the youngest one‚Äôs - the only girl among the three - movements as she creates a strong gust of wind with a wave of her hand. None of the vines or attacks get past the shield though.   ‚ÄúMy siblings‚Äù the girl answers pointing her hand at the oldest one ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Dan. He‚Äôs the most violent. One time he destroyed our original world but that timeline doesn‚Äôt exist anymore.‚Äù She then points to the girl ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Dani the youngest. She rarely joins the crew lately. And she is actually a clone but at this point most of us have been cloned once or twice so it‚Äôs not a big deal anymore.‚Äù She then points her finger to the last one a boy that flies past them quicker than a lightning freezing everything he touches ‚ÄúAnd this is Danny. He is the most powerful one. Technically he could have just ended the fight with one Wail but kids like to have fun. Also they don‚Äôt get to show off their elemental powers a lot so they are mostly being dramatic for you.‚Äù  She says all this so easily just like a matter of fact and it is at this moment that the members of JL realize the sheer power of whoever these people are. When she casually told them she bested Superman it could have been written as a coincidence a joke. But this?  Dan growls as one of the vines scratches his shoulder. He bleeds green but it‚Äôs only for a second before both the wound and the suit knit themselves back together. This is not just a simple accelerated healing it almost looks like a miracle.   ‚ÄúOi brats I‚Äôm done with show off get out of the way!‚Äù He yells at the other two and Danny and Dani quickly follow the order flying closer to him and behind his back.   ‚ÄúCover your ears‚Äù Jazz tells the heroes around her and puts her helmet back on as Dan takes a deep breath and screams.   It hurts even those who follow Jazz‚Äôs advice. Batman feels like his eardrums are about to be shattered for the lack of better word. But the vines like the sonic attack even less - most of them subdue and pull back inside the portal and the rest is dissipating like they are being burned from the inside out.   And then just like it began the scream - the wail - stops. The silence feels deafening after the end of it but slowly the sounds return and the JL watches Danny flying down to the center of the portal. He puts his hands on the surface of it and for a long moment nothing happens.   And then the Pit starts closing up.   Or no it is Danny who absorbs it the green flowing up through his hands his veins that start glowing the same green. His eyes become the same toxic color with no whites and no irises just glowing green all over and his hair shimmers like stars.   A few minutes later the portal is gone like it never even existed and Danny plants his feet on the ground and stretches like one would do after a good rest.   ‚ÄúOof that was nice!‚Äù He turns to the other two who are still up in the air ‚ÄúDo you want some?‚Äù   Dan flips him off before going back to the ship but Dani floats down to him and extends her hands out.   ‚ÄúSure. I like getting it from you better than from the portal itself anyway. Gives it a sparkling taste like Sprite‚Äù she chuckles. Danny takes her hands in his and the green glow slowly makes its way through their joined palms now flowing through the girl‚Äôs body.   ‚ÄúWhat are they?‚Äù Flash whispers horrified but Jazz hears it nonetheless and turns her head to him taking her helmet off once again.   ‚ÄúThat is not a very appropriate question‚Äù she chastises and smiles at their faces ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs okay I get it. They are ghosts. Or ectoplasmic entities or halfas or highly liminal beings. Or if you want a very simplified version they are dead kids who are enjoying their afterlife a little too much.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDead?‚Äù Batman zeros on the word snapping his eyes at the girl. She smiles and for the first time it doesn‚Äôt look human. Her teeth are too sharp her grin too wide and her eyes are suddenly not just teal but neon bright and glowing with vertical irises.   ‚ÄúMost of us are dead in one way or another. And I do not mean it in a metaphorical sense.‚Äù  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-  What I‚Äôm thinking is they have a whole system going on. Amity Park generally resides in the Realms but from time to time they decide they want to go on a vacation as a whole town and they pop into existence on one of the Earths. They don‚Äôt really care for the universe or dimension they end up in as long as it is more or less peaceful (as in no active wars going on right where they pop up) has sunlight and nice weather.   The GIW is taking care of legal things - imagine US government reaction when a whole ass town just boom starts existing in a place where nothing existed before? So GIW does all the paperwork and discussions. Also they are doing their basic research on the dimension they end up in for science purposes.   I‚Äôm thinking Vlad is still a mayor of Amity. And sometimes when a particular dimension is rather annoying he straight up possesses the authorities because he hates official talks and couldn‚Äôt care less for morals if he tried for a week. The GIW scolds him but don‚Äôt really say no. It‚Äôs not a good solution to the problem but hey it works.  Meanwhile Fentons are doing ectoplasmic research. They scan the dimension for troubles basically looking for natural portals and ghosts causing ruckus. Jazz is almost always the one who does the talking to the heroes native to the dimension - she is the one who has the most patience and social skills. Jack is in charge of transportation and Maddie is the head of biological ecto-biological and other species research. Tucker is the tech specialist of course - he is the sole reason why Amity has wi-fi wherever they go. Val and her father are kind of protectors? Security? But for the whole town yeah. They do have GIW agents as subordinates.   Dani is not always living in Amity she travels the Realms most of the time but she joins when something interesting happens. Dan is like on an eternal probation period GIW and Fentons keep an eye on him but he is one of the heavy hitters for when shit goes down.   Danny is living his best life he is mainly the protector spirit of Amity but he also gets to protect all the dimensions from ghosts! He helps anyone and everyone - one day he is working with Val on defenses for their main ship they use to travel inside dimensions and the next day he is joining Maddie in her studies of new species found.   Oh I forgot Sam. She is probably the one responsible for the magic stuff - mostly everyone else focuses on scientific aspects but she is the one to research on occult things.      |  |,2024-07-08 09:45:38 GMT

Are most of them not like‚Ä¶first world gen z or what? Why do they talk like boomers in puritan culture? My old ass is so confused.   In my country we ship whatever the hell we want because they are not real. No one cares if said characters are the most horrible human being. But calling people names over their ship preference is so childish and such an unhinged behavior.   And just slightly over a decade ago people would ship the most crack ships possible across all fandoms and nobody batted an eye. Why is it so hard now? What happens to some younger people that make them so rigid and protective over something that aren‚Äôt even real?

Plus I don‚Äôt want money.‚Äù You say with a hand on your hip. ‚ÄúSo what do yo-I need something to eat!‚Äù You cut him off. ‚ÄúOh um ok I normally get a sandwich from a soup kitchen but they shut down‚Äù he signed putting down a tier and holding out his hand for you to shake. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll share what I can get from this. Ok?‚Äù He asked ‚Äúyes! Oh I‚Äôm y/n y/n L/n‚Äù you say ‚Äúnice to meet you y/n I‚Äôm Jason Todd but‚Ä¶around here I go by jay you should figure out a new name as well it‚Äôs safer like idk umm maybe Jen ?‚Äù ‚ÄúOk sure jen and jay sounds cool!‚Äù  after around three years you got to know him better and became his closest friend and had maybe kissed once or twice. But then he disappeared. Vanished. Like he was never there. Only a week after Jason‚Äôs disappearance you were descoverd and put into foster homes but avenchualy you met the Kent‚Äôs. Thay already had a son Conner and he instantly saw you as his baby sister. When you found out that your foster father was the superman you begged him to let you train to become his sidekick along side Conner! And one day he agreed! You were over the moon you may not of had powers but you were one heck of an engineer you had made rocket boots so you could keep up with your brother and dad and not to mention a total badass when it came to hand to hand combat. You were 14 when Bruce Wayne came to your home to ask you to enter the titans who really needed an engineer. ‚ÄúCan I? Please dad please?!‚Äù You practically begged him ‚Äúoh god fine but Bruce if I come round and see her with a fucking stab wound she comes home!‚Äù Clark made it very clear on that but the next thing you know you‚Äôre in the elevator with your dad and Bruce by your sides. When you step out every one is in the living room watching some murder mystery movie or something like that. ‚ÄúEveryone I would like you to meet y/n L/n - Kent.‚Äù Bruce said as he patted your shoulder. ‚ÄúOk I got to go be careful n/n‚Äù Clark said as he kissed your forehead before leaving. ‚ÄúHi everyone I‚Äôm your new engineer.‚Äù You say as everyone comes to meet you expect one a black haired blue eyed teen still sat watching the tv. ‚ÄúOmg hi I‚Äôm Rachael finally more teenage girls!‚Äù You smile at the girl and everyone comes to say hi and greets you. ‚ÄúJason.‚Äù Bruce calls out ‚Äúcome and introduce yourself‚Äù. ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm good thanks B much rather be here right now there about to enter crime alley!‚Äù Said the boy. You recognise the name Jason and his attitude towards everyone it was all familiar like you knew him from your childhood but didn‚Äôt know were. Dick when over and turned of the Tv to get Jason‚Äôs attention ‚Äúwhat the hell dickhead!?‚Äù He said standing up. ‚ÄúJason we all know you like crime alley but come meet new kid‚Äù they both walked over ‚Äúhi I‚Äôm y/n L/n - Kent nice to meet you‚Äù you said ‚ÄúJason Todd good to meet-wait L/n?‚Äù He asked you like he had remembered something. ‚ÄúUm yeah that‚Äôs me formally L/n now L/n - Kent‚Äù you said trying to explain you weren‚Äôt born a Kent. ‚ÄúNo you‚Äôre what‚Ä¶Jen? That‚Äôs your nickname right? Jen?‚Äù He asked ‚Äúyes it is- holy shit jay!?‚Äù You responded as he pulled you into a hug ‚ÄúI never thought I‚Äôd see you again!‚Äù Jason said still hugging you ‚Äúum what is going on?‚Äù Asked gar ‚Äúyeah not trying to reck the mood but do you know echother?‚Äù Kory asked ‚Äúum yeah we dated in crime alley‚Ä¶ speaking of which‚Äù you said pushing Jason off you. ‚ÄúWhere the hell did you go? You just left me i when to bye us some sandwiches and when I get back you we‚Äôre gone!‚Äù You said still holding his shoulder‚Äôs ‚ÄúI know I know Ieft you and I‚Äôm so sorry but um can we talk about this somewhere that isn‚Äôt in font of my dad?‚Äù He said with that stupid voice he used when you argued back a crime alley.  When everyone was getting ready for bed later you Hurd somebody knock on your door you opened it to see Jason ‚Äúhay babe can we talk?‚Äù You pulled him in pining him against the wall. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ‚Äòbabe‚Äô me you left that is by far the opposite of being a good boyfriend!‚Äùyou said you were about to carry on yelling at Jason but just as you opened your mouth he kissed you and you couldn‚Äôt help but kiss him back because in all truth no matter how angry you were at him you couldn‚Äôt help but miss how he kissed you how he used to play with your hair after you had nightmares or when he would play a old music tape on his VHS player that you when both dance and sing along to you had missed everything about him and in all honesty so did he.,2024-07-08 10:55:24 GMT

At least now.   The redhead nods ‚ÄúSure ask away I‚Äôll answer everything I can.‚Äù Then she notices Batman reaching to touch the green shield and makes a soft warning noise ‚ÄúAh sorry please don‚Äôt touch it. I can show how it works later but it‚Äôs not meant to keep you out. It‚Äôs to keep everything else in.‚Äù  Batman reluctantly puts his head down and turns to her.   ‚ÄúElaborate.‚Äù  The sci-fi ship in the air makes a loud hissing sound like compressed air being released and the bottom part of it slides open. Jazz nods in the direction of the now open ship.   ‚ÄúYou know what they say it‚Äôs better to see it once than to hear it ten times.‚Äù  There are three humanoid figures standing in there. All of them are mostly monochrome black and white clothes starkling white hair. They look like one adult and two children but it‚Äôs one of the kids who raises his hands to his mouth and yells so loud everyone in three miles radius is able to hear him:  ‚ÄúStep away from the shield please shit‚Äôs about to get real!‚Äù   None of the heroes move but Jazz does take a few steps away. Wonder Woman after a moment of hesitation follows her example.   A mechanical voice comes from the ship itself ‚ÄúCountdown to the breach. Five‚Ä¶ Four‚Ä¶‚Äù  On ‚Äòthree‚Äô all three of the monochrome figures step out from the ship. But before any of the heroes have time to worry they all float in the air undeterred by gravity and the ship door closes behind them.   The countdown reaches &#x27;one‚Äô. And in the next moment it looks like the hell breaks loose.   Countless giant vines shoot out from the portal up reaching for the ship. True to what the red hoverboarder said they are very much toothy every vine splitting in two and attempting to bite the ship like some twisted idea of scissors.   None of them reach it.   The oldest of three kids claps his hands and a wall of raging fire descends on the vines throwing them off. In the next moment the trio falls apart flying through the lovecraftian mess of carnivorous plants with practiced ease the younger ones using what looks like icicles and little storms.   ‚ÄúWho are they?‚Äù Batman asks Jazz following the youngest one‚Äôs - the only girl among the three - movements as she creates a strong gust of wind with a wave of her hand. None of the vines or attacks get past the shield though.   ‚ÄúMy siblings‚Äù the girl answers pointing her hand at the oldest one ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Dan. He‚Äôs the most violent. One time he destroyed our original world but that timeline doesn‚Äôt exist anymore.‚Äù She then points to the girl ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Dani the youngest. She rarely joins the crew lately. And she is actually a clone but at this point most of us have been cloned once or twice so it‚Äôs not a big deal anymore.‚Äù She then points her finger to the last one a boy that flies past them quicker than a lightning freezing everything he touches ‚ÄúAnd this is Danny. He is the most powerful one. Technically he could have just ended the fight with one Wail but kids like to have fun. Also they don‚Äôt get to show off their elemental powers a lot so they are mostly being dramatic for you.‚Äù  She says all this so easily just like a matter of fact and it is at this moment that the members of JL realize the sheer power of whoever these people are. When she casually told them she bested Superman it could have been written as a coincidence a joke. But this?  Dan growls as one of the vines scratches his shoulder. He bleeds green but it‚Äôs only for a second before both the wound and the suit knit themselves back together. This is not just a simple accelerated healing it almost looks like a miracle.   ‚ÄúOi brats I‚Äôm done with show off get out of the way!‚Äù He yells at the other two and Danny and Dani quickly follow the order flying closer to him and behind his back.   ‚ÄúCover your ears‚Äù Jazz tells the heroes around her and puts her helmet back on as Dan takes a deep breath and screams.   It hurts even those who follow Jazz‚Äôs advice. Batman feels like his eardrums are about to be shattered for the lack of better word. But the vines like the sonic attack even less - most of them subdue and pull back inside the portal and the rest is dissipating like they are being burned from the inside out.   And then just like it began the scream - the wail - stops. The silence feels deafening after the end of it but slowly the sounds return and the JL watches Danny flying down to the center of the portal. He puts his hands on the surface of it and for a long moment nothing happens.   And then the Pit starts closing up.   Or no it is Danny who absorbs it the green flowing up through his hands his veins that start glowing the same green. His eyes become the same toxic color with no whites and no irises just glowing green all over and his hair shimmers like stars.   A few minutes later the portal is gone like it never even existed and Danny plants his feet on the ground and stretches like one would do after a good rest.   ‚ÄúOof that was nice!‚Äù He turns to the other two who are still up in the air ‚ÄúDo you want some?‚Äù   Dan flips him off before going back to the ship but Dani floats down to him and extends her hands out.   ‚ÄúSure. I like getting it from you better than from the portal itself anyway. Gives it a sparkling taste like Sprite‚Äù she chuckles. Danny takes her hands in his and the green glow slowly makes its way through their joined palms now flowing through the girl‚Äôs body.   ‚ÄúWhat are they?‚Äù Flash whispers horrified but Jazz hears it nonetheless and turns her head to him taking her helmet off once again.   ‚ÄúThat is not a very appropriate question‚Äù she chastises and smiles at their faces ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs okay I get it. They are ghosts. Or ectoplasmic entities or halfas or highly liminal beings. Or if you want a very simplified version they are dead kids who are enjoying their afterlife a little too much.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDead?‚Äù Batman zeros on the word snapping his eyes at the girl. She smiles and for the first time it doesn‚Äôt look human. Her teeth are too sharp her grin too wide and her eyes are suddenly not just teal but neon bright and glowing with vertical irises.   ‚ÄúMost of us are dead in one way or another. And I do not mean it in a metaphorical sense.‚Äù  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-  What I‚Äôm thinking is they have a whole system going on. Amity Park generally resides in the Realms but from time to time they decide they want to go on a vacation as a whole town and they pop into existence on one of the Earths. They don‚Äôt really care for the universe or dimension they end up in as long as it is more or less peaceful (as in no active wars going on right where they pop up) has sunlight and nice weather.   The GIW is taking care of legal things - imagine US government reaction when a whole ass town just boom starts existing in a place where nothing existed before? So GIW does all the paperwork and discussions. Also they are doing their basic research on the dimension they end up in for science purposes.   I‚Äôm thinking Vlad is still a mayor of Amity. And sometimes when a particular dimension is rather annoying he straight up possesses the authorities because he hates official talks and couldn‚Äôt care less for morals if he tried for a week. The GIW scolds him but don‚Äôt really say no. It‚Äôs not a good solution to the problem but hey it works.  Meanwhile Fentons are doing ectoplasmic research. They scan the dimension for troubles basically looking for natural portals and ghosts causing ruckus. Jazz is almost always the one who does the talking to the heroes native to the dimension - she is the one who has the most patience and social skills. Jack is in charge of transportation and Maddie is the head of biological ecto-biological and other species research. Tucker is the tech specialist of course - he is the sole reason why Amity has wi-fi wherever they go. Val and her father are kind of protectors? Security? But for the whole town yeah. They do have GIW agents as subordinates.   Dani is not always living in Amity she travels the Realms most of the time but she joins when something interesting happens. Dan is like on an eternal probation period GIW and Fentons keep an eye on him but he is one of the heavy hitters for when shit goes down.   Danny is living his best life he is mainly the protector spirit of Amity but he also gets to protect all the dimensions from ghosts! He helps anyone and everyone - one day he is working with Val on defenses for their main ship they use to travel inside dimensions and the next day he is joining Maddie in her studies of new species found.   Oh I forgot Sam. She is probably the one responsible for the magic stuff - mostly everyone else focuses on scientific aspects but she is the one to research on occult things.      |  |,2024-07-08 09:45:38 GMT

Are most of them not like‚Ä¶first world gen z or what? Why do they talk like boomers in puritan culture? My old ass is so confused.   In my country we ship whatever the hell we want because they are not real. No one cares if said characters are the most horrible human being. But calling people names over their ship preference is so childish and such an unhinged behavior.   And just slightly over a decade ago people would ship the most crack ships possible across all fandoms and nobody batted an eye. Why is it so hard now? What happens to some younger people that make them so rigid and protective over something that aren‚Äôt even real?  Sometimes I feel like fandom culture has changed into a mean girl club or something. People are so mean but at the same time so‚Ä¶basic?

The GIW are always the bad guys and well yeah they fit the criteria for being the shadow branch of the government to commit atrocities. But there‚Äôs potential in good GIW.   Imagine it.   Imagine Amity Park being off-limits not because GIW wants to keep it contained but because they treat it like a resort or a national park. People are not allowed to freely come there only because GIW wants JL out of it since the heroes are going to treat the whole thing as a threat. But there‚Äôs an infinite amount of knowledge there! A portal to the new world! New culture! Things you could never learn before!   Imagine Amity being under government‚Äôs protection. Imagine Jazz attending a university with her full tuition paid by the GIW since she is well a liminal a minority and she is getting a degree that will help her establish connections between them and Infinite Realms.   Imagine GIW funding Fentons‚Äô research not in order to eradicate ghosts but to have a safe way to talk to them while not getting caught up in a fight with an impossibly strong being.   Imagine GIW being hella annoying to Danny because they just won‚Äôt stop with their interviews and questionnaires. Which actually has the full potential to become confusing because imagine Batman meeting Phantom and Phantom is like ‚ÄúOh yeah there‚Äôs a hidden government branch that I avoid like plague because they want to catch me‚Äù and Bats are super worried. In the meantime GIW is looking for Danny simply because he is the most friendly ghost they encountered and they want their answers about the cultural differences between the dead and the living.   Now there‚Äôs also a way for this to become the thickest plot armor ever. Imagine Jazz is on a mission to get some artifact from the mortal world. Then imagine GIW helping her while they still can‚Äôt exactly show they are government agents because who in their right mind would believe the government is studying ghosts? Anyway Jazz now has the potential to become James Bond kind of cool. Wonderful.  Imagine Danny having trouble with the JL/Bats/police and then he just ‚ÄúWait let me call someone I have the right to one phone call right?‚Äù And not 15 minutes later a bunch of secret government agents in white show up and Danny is free to go while the agents are saying whatever happened is now classified in the best Batman manner.   Oh what about a world-ending event where a ghost is involved and the JL is at a loss of what to do. And then the white vans show up packed with unknown tech agents in white with blasters and a few weird meta-kids no one knows anything about. They even have a K9 unit because come on Cujo could be a perfect friend for them.   Just GIW being the secret protection squad for Amity and ghosts.,2024-07-08 12:14:59 GMT

You this is my place back off!‚Äù You say to him ‚Äúho sorry kid but I need these if I want to eat tonight‚Äù the strange boy said picking up the tires. ‚ÄúIt will cost you!‚Äù You say just as he is about to walk off. ‚ÄúYeah ok fair point. What you need kid?‚Äù He asked walking towards you. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt give you money though! I have a cigarette?‚Äù He said jokingly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 10 and a half! Plus I don‚Äôt want money.‚Äù You say with a hand on your hip. ‚ÄúSo what do yo-I need something to eat!‚Äù You cut him off. ‚ÄúOh um ok I normally get a sandwich from a soup kitchen but they shut down‚Äù he signed putting down a tier and holding out his hand for you to shake. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll share what I can get from this. Ok?‚Äù He asked ‚Äúyes! Oh I‚Äôm y/n y/n L/n‚Äù you say ‚Äúnice to meet you y/n I‚Äôm Jason Todd but‚Ä¶around here I go by jay you should figure out a new name as well it‚Äôs safer like idk umm maybe Jen ?‚Äù ‚ÄúOk sure jen and jay sounds cool!‚Äù  after around three years you got to know him better and became his closest friend and had maybe kissed once or twice. But then he disappeared. Vanished. Like he was never there. Only a week after Jason‚Äôs disappearance you were descoverd and put into foster homes but avenchualy you met the Kent‚Äôs. Thay already had a son Conner and he instantly saw you as his baby sister. When you found out that your foster father was the superman you begged him to let you train to become his sidekick along side Conner! And one day he agreed! You were over the moon you may not of had powers but you were one heck of an engineer you had made rocket boots so you could keep up with your brother and dad and not to mention a total badass when it came to hand to hand combat. You were 14 when Bruce Wayne came to your home to ask you to enter the titans who really needed an engineer. ‚ÄúCan I? Please dad please?!‚Äù You practically begged him ‚Äúoh god fine but Bruce if I come round and see her with a fucking stab wound she comes home!‚Äù Clark made it very clear on that but the next thing you know you‚Äôre in the elevator with your dad and Bruce by your sides. When you step out every one is in the living room watching some murder mystery movie or something like that. ‚ÄúEveryone I would like you to meet y/n L/n - Kent.‚Äù Bruce said as he patted your shoulder. ‚ÄúOk I got to go be careful n/n‚Äù Clark said as he kissed your forehead before leaving. ‚ÄúHi everyone I‚Äôm your new engineer.‚Äù You say as everyone comes to meet you expect one a black haired blue eyed teen still sat watching the tv. ‚ÄúOmg hi I‚Äôm Rachael finally more teenage girls!‚Äù You smile at the girl and everyone comes to say hi and greets you. ‚ÄúJason.‚Äù Bruce calls out ‚Äúcome and introduce yourself‚Äù. ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm good thanks B much rather be here right now there about to enter crime alley!‚Äù Said the boy. You recognise the name Jason and his attitude towards everyone it was all familiar like you knew him from your childhood but didn‚Äôt know were. Dick when over and turned of the Tv to get Jason‚Äôs attention ‚Äúwhat the hell dickhead!?‚Äù He said standing up. ‚ÄúJason we all know you like crime alley but come meet new kid‚Äù they both walked over ‚Äúhi I‚Äôm y/n L/n - Kent nice to meet you‚Äù you said ‚ÄúJason Todd good to meet-wait L/n?‚Äù He asked you like he had remembered something. ‚ÄúUm yeah that‚Äôs me formally L/n now L/n - Kent‚Äù you said trying to explain you weren‚Äôt born a Kent. ‚ÄúNo you‚Äôre what‚Ä¶Jen? That‚Äôs your nickname right? Jen?‚Äù He asked ‚Äúyes it is- holy shit jay!?‚Äù You responded as he pulled you into a hug ‚ÄúI never thought I‚Äôd see you again!‚Äù Jason said still hugging you ‚Äúum what is going on?‚Äù Asked gar ‚Äúyeah not trying to reck the mood but do you know echother?‚Äù Kory asked ‚Äúum yeah we dated in crime alley‚Ä¶ speaking of which‚Äù you said pushing Jason off you. ‚ÄúWhere the hell did you go? You just left me i when to bye us some sandwiches and when I get back you we‚Äôre gone!‚Äù You said still holding his shoulder‚Äôs ‚ÄúI know I know Ieft you and I‚Äôm so sorry but um can we talk about this somewhere that isn‚Äôt in font of my dad?‚Äù He said with that stupid voice he used when you argued back a crime alley.  When everyone was getting ready for bed later you Hurd somebody knock on your door you opened it to see Jason ‚Äúhay babe can we talk?‚Äù You pulled him in pining him against the wall. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ‚Äòbabe‚Äô me you left that is by far the opposite of being a good boyfriend!‚Äùyou said you were about to carry on yelling at Jason but just as you opened your mouth he kissed you and you couldn‚Äôt help but kiss him back because in all truth no matter how angry you were at him you couldn‚Äôt help but miss how he kissed you how he used to play with your hair after you had nightmares or when he would play a old music tape on his VHS player that you when both dance and sing along to you had missed everything about him and in all honesty so did he.,2024-07-08 10:55:24 GMT

0,Batman,['song spouts bullshit'  'about the supertiddies'],thatonesongyouretryingtoremember,very unorganized thoughts:  &lt;!-- more --&gt; I am watching the The Batman cartoon rn and I went in with the expectation that Bruce is the guy who reluctantly keeps this kids on his hero team just to stop them from becoming evil which is probably more comfortable bc it makes Bruce definitively a Good Guy and still leaves room for cool fun Batgirl and Robin episodes. The more I watch it though the more it seems that (for this show at least) this isn‚Äôt the direction they went for. Robin has already decided to Not Kill Bad Guys TM before Bruce has even officially welcomed him into the team. Dick has *fun* fighting villains. Being Batman and Robin is what they bond over and since Bruce is rarely home and therefore would barely interact with Dick if it weren‚Äôt for Robin I think their partnership is literally just the closest Bruce can come to being a good caretaker. We see glimpses of throe relationship in later episodes and that Bruce uses a Dad Voice TM but Dick also talks pretty freely around him and Alfred less cagey than other (traumatized) preteens. Bruce and Dick in this universe only have as good of a relationship as they do because of Robin and that doesn‚Äôt really make it ‚Äúfine‚Äù but it‚Äôs much more interesting that the literal best these two could do for someone they love is. Child Vigilatism.  Not only that but there are times when Bruce tells Dick to go down to the Batcave or to get into the Batmobile in the same way you‚Äôd tell a kid to brush their teeth. For Bruce being the Batman is a choice he makes every single night when he plays hooky from some prior engagement to investigate a robbery Alfred says it‚Äôs probably nothing. It‚Äôs reflexive really and Robin is part of the routine I haven‚Äôt yet seen him yet to opt out. Of *course* he‚Äôs coming along this keystone of their family is important just like any other daily routine.  I had more to add I think but this‚Äôll do.,2024-07-08 14:53:37 GMT

Mysteries Issue #4 by Sholly Fisch 4/5  This post is for fan entertainment I‚Äôm not being paid.  Hi everyone  This is issues center around gargoyles statues coming to life and running amok around town. But the main mystery is that people are turning in the gargoyles.  This is one of the first issues of this series we get to see Robin (Or at least that I have as I am still tracking down #2) but we also get a classic character from the comics but this version of him is reminds me of the Animated Series: Detective Harvey Bullock.  Bullock is briefing both Batman and Robin and Mystery Inc. about the situation and there is also a minor about the different types of gargoyles.  But then one of the officers slowly turned into a gargoyle and flies off and the group of heroes give chase.  Now I don‚Äôt know why people got so heated when they were looking for the gargoyles. After another person gets turned into a gargoyle which now by this point poor Shaggy and Scooby Doo try to run away from the gargoyle but keeps running into shops that sell them and statues outside of business.  Now after the group regroups and discusses what they have learned and hash out what they should do next. Batman tries to figure out the pattern of why these particular individuals were turned and even to the way the gargoyles look.  Also in this issue we do get to see Oracle even though we see more of the AI Avatar and the back of Babs.  The mystery group pinpoints the next possible location of a new target at a local theater.  This is where I will stop since the next few pages will have the group umasking the culprit and then get into the fight that results that the culprit getting arrested. (Thank you handy dandy Bat-knock out gas).  This was a good issue but I like the Catwoman issues a little more. Just for the fact there were more clues and hunting round for evidence.

For fucks sake they were sharing a bed until like 1960.   He‚Äôs a helicopter parent who often complains loudly that his son has friends and in most continuities Dick is literally running to the titans to get rid of his smother.   He‚Äôs overprotective. Dick is literally the only Robin he tried to bench. Several times.   It all stems from how he lost his parents it‚Äôs a normal reaction parents have if they have gone through great loss.   Jason he‚Äôs actually pretty healthy with. I think he learned from the fact Dick is hiding from him smothering isn‚Äôt working.   Jason dies and he goes back to once more trying to smother Dick but more unhealthy this time since he‚Äôs outright trying to control him. This is too a trauma response but he doesn‚Äôt get past it this time.   I don‚Äôt think he ever had a parent relationship with Tim. Controversial sure but all the time Tim was a child he had parents he could go home to which meant Tim only saw the positive side of Bruce.   Now when Damian was introduced I would call that neglect. It took awhile in canon continuity before he even started parenting him and he stopped being as controlling of Dick meaning he‚Äôs trying to overcome his trauma,2024-07-08 15:10:48 GMT

Not just because he likes cracking skulls. He actually hates resorting to violence that‚Äôs why he tries to outsmart every situation. It‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt kill.

Specifically Clark and Diana.   I see so many posts about how the Justice league knows nothing about the batkids and I‚Äôm sorry to me that‚Äôs the most boring way to do things and completely against characterization and history if it‚Äôs just the whole league. If you think Clark and Diana don‚Äôt love those kids as family it‚Äôs not really my cup of tea (to a lesser extent Barry and J&#x27;onn).   I get that there are a lot of batkids and a lot of different comics with different minds behind them so I can only reference what I know and from what I‚Äôve experienced. Still I read comics for a while and I feel like my personal headcanons are:  Nightwing should absolutely adore his aunt and uncle he‚Äôs nightwing because of a conversation he had with Superman. He was the first Robin and adored in the superhero community. He led the titans was best friends with Donna.  Red Hood I think Jason might be a bit more chilly towards Clark Like everything after he came back things went to shit especially after he found out Clark stopped Bruce from killing the Joker to avenge him. but has a lot of fond memories towards Clark when he was Robin. He still has a real love for Aunt Diana probably avoids her though because she is a reminder of the good times he had as Robin.  Red Robin things are complicated with him as he was on the Outsiders with Connor and Cassie and later on the Titans with them. When they were the outsiders the Justice League probably felt more like the man trying to control them. Later on during the titans things get angsty so I think that might color Tim‚Äôs perception of them and favor the way his friends describe them more than what he‚Äôs seen of them. I think he has good memories but not nearly as much as Jason or Dick  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve read any comics about Spoiler Black Bat or Signal‚Äôs interactions with them so I would leave that to those who know more. That being said I think their interactions would be fun I think Cass would respect Diana as probably the world‚Äôs best warrior and I think Duke would really look up to Clark partially because he‚Äôs superman but also he‚Äôs fun and light not to mention they both have light powers even if they manifest differently. I don‚Äôt really know much about Stephanie and her interactions with other heroes tbh   Damian I think is interesting because I think he actually respects Clark more as a journalist and as Jon‚Äôs father than he does as Superman. At least at first. Superman has all these powers but doesn‚Äôt really do a lot of what he sees as big changes so I think at first he considers his powers a waste on small potatoes stuff. He does come to respect him though. Diana I think Damian adores pretty quickly even if he says otherwise I think they bond over their love of animals. I also think that Damian respects that Diana will kill if necessary he was trained by the league of assassins I understand that as a member of the batfamily he doesn‚Äôt kill but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right for him to be as antikilling as the rest. I think out of respect for Dick and his father he doesn‚Äôt kill but he understands that some people need killing.     I‚Äôm not trying to yuck anyone‚Äôs um your headcanons are your own but I see so many posts that just don‚Äôt get how fun interactions with characters are with their canon personalities.,2024-07-08 17:30:27 GMT

He feels alone and isolated insecure in his own skin and unsure of where to go from here.   When he is forcibly turned into a child Clark must try to survive against the odds. Yet it also becomes an opportunity to experience what it‚Äôs like to be powerless.   To be human.   He could never have imagined that the one to save him would be the mysterious vigilante of Gotham City.

He was above such things. He was the heir to the shadows the son of the bat. The dark feared him.   If he was shivering- if- it was from the cold. His perch on a ledge fifty stories up was nonconsequential in this matter; it was simply the bite of the wind that made his hair stand on end. No other reason.  Damian steeled himself. He was only surveying his new dominion‚Äîthe buildings and people he was born to protect‚Äîso there was no need for his throat to tighten. If Drake was capable of this- so am I.  Perhaps it was his company that made him nauseous; Richard was wearing the honored mantle and that simply was unacceptable. Damian- not one of the menagerie of street filth- was the only one that should take up his father‚Äôs cowl but Richard had spoken some nonsense about age and now he was Robin.  Carefully Damian glanced past his precariously placed toes down at the street below and his mouth went dry. This was ridiculous all of these pockets in the utility belt and no water? Of course his mouth would get dry there is no other possible reason.   ‚ÄúAre you steady Robin?‚Äù  Damian‚Äôs upper lip curled ‚ÄúOf course Batman‚Äù his fingers found the hilt of a knife strapped to his leg ‚Äúmy capabilities are beyond doubt.‚Äù  A gloved hand found his shoulder squeezing gently ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful isn‚Äôt it.‚Äù  Damian stared out at the city. Most windows were completely blocked to prevent light from escaping almost every business had closed at sundown and the only pedestrians were drug runners working girls and their johns and various street rats ‚ÄúYour vocabulary has obvious flaws.‚Äù  The hand tightened on his shoulder ‚ÄúGotham has her troubles but there is beauty here Robin. That is the mission you lack faith.‚Äù  All of the vague nausea Damian felt was replaced with acidic rage. He lacked faith? Richard knew naught of the word. Damian shrugged the hand off and spun facing the armor he had dreamed of for his entire life (worn by the wrong man) ‚ÄúI am here only because of my faith. This is my mission my inheritance. You are a placeholder maintaining my destiny‚Äù his fingers tightened around the ornate dagger his mother had given him for his journey ‚Äútherein lies my faith Batman.‚Äù  They thought he was mean they thought he was rude fine. Damian Wayne was born with a legacy to uphold. He was beyond flaws and fears.,2024-07-08 19:50:14 GMT

Dick never made his way into the manor as a kid and never made the mantle.  Instead Jason only has Batman to look up to growing up watching the caped crusader knock down rouge after rogue and always save the day. Until he doesn‚Äôt and Jason dies when Joker holds a group of school students hostage while they are on a field trip 7 of them dying in the following explosion that tore the building they had been held in to shreds. He still mysteriously revives clawing his way out of his own grave and right into the clutches of the Court of Owls where his resentment towards Batman‚Äôs only seems to grow.  Instead Tim notices some similarities between his eccentric neighbor and on mysterious cape but can never act on it before he is put into the foster system after his parents died in a car crash. He is catching all sort of attention with his proficiency with computers and logic puzzles family after family complaining about his ability to get into places he should not be even at the ripe age on 9. It‚Äôs not until he manages to wiggle his way past a politicians fire wall that he too catches the Courts attention.  Without the Robin mantle filled with smiles and banter to guide them the two fall into a competition with one another under the courts guidance.  Who can make a name for themselves among Gothams infamous rogues? Who is going to succeed and bring along the praises of the court?

Damian has a habit of burning Bakoor and sometimes the smell lingers on his suit. He also transfers tiny amounts of cat hairs onto places which is how Dick always knows when he‚Äôs been in the apartment. Stephanie has a very particular way of scratching locks when she opens them. Lightbulbs LEDs shadows et cetera despite Duke‚Äôs best attempts either get brighter or duller when he‚Äôs around. Jason can usually tell if Dick‚Äôs around because one of his knees is permanently creaky. Tim‚Äôs retractable staff rattles just barely when he jumps around. Jason himself can get detected by the amount of gunpowder on him or the smallest squeaking of the leather jacket he prefers. Bruce can get by super-senses on occasion but all his kids know when he‚Äôs around immediately. He uses trackers to keep tabs on all his kids and there‚Äôs usually an arms race to get around his increasingly complicated tracking tools before he can replace them.   Cass of course is impossible to catch except by Alfred who has an ESP-like sixth sense for all of them and is always unimpressed by attempts to scare him.,2024-07-08 19:33:28 GMT

At some point Bruce kisses him as superman after a rescue and Clark is emotionally going through it coz his boyfriend kissed another guy. Even if that guy is technically him he‚Äôs still mad and jealous of himself somehow coz even superman can‚Äôt compete with Superman. He‚Äôs not even sure whether or not to confronted Bruce about his affair since it keeps happening.   While he‚Äôs trying to figure all this out Batmanof all people kisses him. And he does it so casually. Sure Clark had a crush on him for a while but he‚Äôs over it now and he‚Äôs in a committed relationship that he thought batman knew about. Now he‚Äôs extra scared of confronting Bruce because he doesn‚Äôt want it to look like he‚Äôs just starting a fight so he can be with batman. And he‚Äôs still hoping there‚Äôs a way to work through this and for them to be together. He‚Äôs being haunted by his moral code to just talk about this and get it over with but he‚Äôs still afraid of losing Bruce and living in the shadow of the idolized version of himself again.   *Meanwhile in the batcave*  La la la Bruce twirling around liking a fairy princess living his best life: my boyfriend‚Äôs the best and every thing is perfect. Maybe world peace is real. Is this what happiness feels like?   The bat kids have tried giving him several rabies shots and an exorcism.,2024-07-08 19:05:01 GMT

Red hood Jason demands that Batman kill him. That after everything he‚Äôs done all the people he‚Äôs killed he pleads with his dad to kill the Batman (although he‚Äôd never admit that he still loves the man as a father not yet).  There‚Äôs some dramatic back and forth where Batman refuses and Red Hood insists pleads that Batman Bruce kill the joker until Bruce rips off the cowl and reveals that he did!  He did kill the Joker! He wore his favorite suit and grabbed two $1000 watches and used them as brass knuckles and beat the fucker to death! He burned his body and buried the ashes outside of the goddamn Fortress of Solitude so no one would find them! He folded up the bloodied suit and boxed them with the broken watches and put them a hidden compartment in the base of Jason‚Äôs memorial in the cave where no one would ever touch or find them! He waited until Superman was off world so he wouldn‚Äôt stop him again and told no one of what he did!      And how that ends is up to y‚Äôall. I just think that it‚Äôs interesting how there are canonically 3 Jokers (possibly more if dc changes their mind) and wouldn‚Äôt it be fun if Bruce knowingly murdered one of them only for another to pop up and make him suicidal to the point where a little Timothy Drake needs to blackmail his way into being Robin so he doesn‚Äôt kill himself?,2024-07-08 21:04:01 GMT

Bruce needed to study law criminology forensics psychology sociology penology to improve Gotham so he enrolled in Gotham U again. However he was going to play the role of the annoying rich brat aka introducing Brucie Wayne to the world. HE PAID PEOPLE TO BE HIS FRIENDS. They tried to expel him he just paid the administration to keep him. But also he would disguise himself to ask questions to the teachers. And illegally enter the building to go through his professors‚Äô belongings to learn more advanced stuffs‚Ä¶ You know he showed up ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù or ‚Äúhangover‚Äù to class and was loud af about it.  100% Bruce has a degree in law because of his time there but he bought it (and everyone know he bought it) instead of actually earning it which he was 100% capable of. (Gotham is corrupted af he can easily do that)  Yeah he is the worst thing that ever happened to Gotham U and everyone hates him there. (Yes worse than criminals. Every college has a couple of graduates that commit crimes later on. How many of them have a rich brat bringing a LAND PHONE because Bruce was in college before mobile phones existed so he can loudly gossip on the phone during class and cannot be expelled because he is the one founding the new library???)  Also funny to imagine this is when he met Harvey and for some reason he was his only real friend. (Maybe they had to work together on a project and Bruce felt too bad about ruining someone else grade by being a dick so he did show up to work with Harvey. And even tho he did his best to keep the mask on while not ruining Harvey‚Äôs grade he let out how much he actually cares about Gotham and wants to improve it. They bonded over that and now Harvey is the only one to know that Bruce Wayne isn‚Äôt a rich brat but someone who cares about others.)  Btw him saying that ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt have done for playboy Bruce Wayne to criticize the entire penology system‚Äù means that Bruce disagrees with the penology system in the USA which is a punitive system and also the death penalty as penology modern studies are against it for being immoral and unethical. His education in the subject means that Bruce could actually use researches and works to explain why he is against killing and I think it would be so funny to have him quoting Rousseau Voltaire and Montesquieu to Jason.,2024-07-08 23:02:28 GMT

The same hair the same attitude even the same laugh though without much evidence it‚Äôs hard to tell. At a glance you‚Äôd know he‚Äôs the blood son.  Tim is like Bruce most when wrapped in a finely tailored suit. He would hold his glass with the same elegance smile with all the same practiced enthusiasm chat about the same useless topics with the same kinds of useless people. All while holding back the same groans.  Jason fights like the Bat. They all do to a certain extent but watching him you‚Äôd see the targets he chooses. The liver the side of the knee. No matter the opponent he fights to put an end to things. And he fights the same whether it‚Äôs a standard run in with a mugger off the street or a last stand with a body that‚Äôs bruised and broken.   And Dick?   If you were to go back in time to a little boy clutching his parents‚Äô bloodied bodies you‚Äôd see something old in those eyes. It‚Äôd be subtle hidden behind teary unfocused irises. But if you looked hard enough it‚Äôd be there and it would see you for what you are whatever that may be. It would read the words you keep closest to your heart and air them out for you plain as day.

It was about Terry McGinnis searching for and bringing all that Batboys (Ex:DickJasonTim and Damian) back to the manor as an aging Bruce Wayne begins to die. I liked the story and premise of it. It made be think of stuff I wrote a long time ago and maybe I could write something similar but different. Especially with a reader instead of Terry. So let me know what you think. ;)  Batfamily x batsis!reader  Synopsis: Three years since Bruce‚Äôs disappearance and with all of Batman‚Äôs former Robins gone Gotham is under protection of the Batwoman but she will need help to take on one of Gotham biggest Civil Wars ever.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  A seasoned and experienced Vickie Vale comes on the screen of a television. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been three years since the mysterious disappearance of Billionaire-Philanthropist Bruce Wayne Wayne was on a flight to Shanghai for a business trip when the flight was thrown off course. Still to this day the flight crew or Mr. Wayne have been seen. Wayne Enterprise Chairman Lucius Fox released a statement.‚Äù   ‚Äî  ‚ÄúToday marks three years since Mr. Wayne disappearance. I-I was originally supposed to born the plane but Bruce‚Ä¶he felt that he needed to go instead.‚Äù He swallows‚Äù After consulting with authorities and with permission from the Wayne Estate I come before you to declare Bruce Wayne as dead. Normally this is something done after seven yearsbut the family has asked for this closure. We respect their wishes. No further common.‚Äù He leaves as several reports and journals ask question after question.  ‚Äî‚Äî  Vickie returns ‚ÄúThis was from the press conference earlier today. A private memorial service will be held for Wayne early next week. We from the GCN family as well as Gotham Thank you for your contribution Mr.Wayne and may you find peace wherever you are. I‚Äôm Vickie Vale and have a good night.‚Äù  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  Gotham City was a sea of old rotten gothic buildings and shiny overgrown skyscrapers. Gotham had been the early stages of becoming more a city of tomorrow. Though the plans had fallen without Bruce. Most of north Gotham was now being rebuilt and renovated the lights of the older city still shinned just a light more dim due to the new LED light that consumed the night.  Sirens filled the night and busy traffic and honking on every corner. Three squad cars fly down the road chasing after two armed trucks.  Gunfire rings the night and civilian duck away from the street.   ‚ÄúPull over! This is GCPD!‚Äù The cars race onto the bridge and barrel pass cars causing some minor accidents in its wake.  ‚ÄúLennyshould we stop?‚Äù A rookie driver swerves from running into a gas truck. The goon beside him pulls off his skii mask and takes an assault rifle.  ‚ÄúAnd risk getting thrown into a cell I‚Äôd rather die than let the boss know we got caught keep drivin.‚Äù   Lenny takes the gun and starts firing towards the squad cars. Taking out of the tires causing it to crash into a three car accident.   ‚ÄúPigs still too slow for Rupert Throne men.‚Äù The car speeds up and then faint sound a ringing as the goons look at each other.  ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù The car jerks as they‚Äôre rammed into. ‚ÄúThe fuck?‚Äù  The turn to see the Batmobile flying towards them.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the fucking Bat!‚Äù The driver floors the gas and takes the exit into East Gotham. The take a sharp turn and rush down the road.  The Batmobile rams into the truck again and the driver runs over a bus stop and light rail.  ‚ÄúDo something!‚Äù He shouts. Lenny takes the gun and fires at the car. The bullets fly off the car without a scratch.  ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù The car speeds besides them and slide swipe the truck. It barrels over the Batmobile and crashes into a store front. The goons groan. Lenny takes a pistol and leans out the window.  The Batmobile is parked on the other side of the room but it‚Äôs not moving.   ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd he gooooooo-‚Äú he fires the gun as he yanked from the window and the sound of punches and grunts are heard. The lanky drive makes a run for it but only get five feet before his foot his tied and he pulled across the ground and pulled up toward the truck.  ‚ÄúHelp!!‚Äù  The figure leaps down and towers over him. It draws closure until the grab him by the shirt.  ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Throne?‚Äù A gruff female voice snarls.  ‚ÄúLook-lady I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He punched in the stomach.   ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt ask twice.‚Äù She grips him tighter.   ‚ÄúHe fled this morning we were supposed to take this stuff to the docks and that‚Äôs it I swear.‚Äù He cries.  Batwoman grins ‚ÄúThat was so hard was it.‚Äù And she punches him in the face knocking him out cold.   Squad cars and a transport truck arrive seconds later. Another black Police van arrives and Commissioner Barbara Gordon wheels her way to the scene.  ‚ÄúAnother one of Throne men?‚Äù The older woman pushes her glass up. She huffs ‚ÄúAny word on where he went?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs left this morning knowing him he told his men one place and went in the complete opposite direction.‚Äù Batwoman holds a phone out and hands it to the Commissioner.  ‚ÄúYou think he‚Äôd left something at his mansion he‚Äôs not a sharp as he used to be. He‚Äôs getting sloppy with his trails.‚Äù She turns in her chair as Batwoman hoped into his car.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll find out.‚Äù The car raced down the street towards the outskirts of the city.  ‚ÄúAlfred.‚Äù Alfred appears on the screen. He‚Äôs more weather and more grey than normal but the older man is still able to assist anyway he can.  ‚ÄúI see you have stopped the stolen goods from reaching the Harbour I take it as that will conclude your night?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNot likely Rupert Throne‚Äôs men said he fled town this morning any activity on his bank accounts or the offshore ones?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think a man of his age would learn to stop his shenanigansbut I digress. Three days ago $100000 was withdrawn from his checking account. Nothing sense.‚Äù   Batwoman nods ‚ÄúI‚Äôm heading to his house Barbara thinks he‚Äôs getting sloppy and I agree.‚Äù   ‚ÄúVery well ma‚ÄôamI will be here if you need anything.‚Äù   ‚Äî‚Äî-  Batwoman drops down in front of the doors to the office and pushes it open. She swiftly moves inside and feels the air is stiff.   She scans the room and sees that it looks slightly messy. Papers scattered around the room and desk the fire is long gone and it‚Äôs cold. The chairs at pushed to the ground and safe is wide open. She glides to it and scans it.  ‚ÄúHis finger prints are recent. At least..three days old.‚Äù The glances into the safe to find it empty.  She worlds around the find the door toward the hallway ajar. She ventures into the dim hallway. She turns a corner and is shocked at the scene before her.  ‚ÄúAgent A I‚Äôm sending live footage to the Batcomputer.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMy word it‚Äôs a massacre.‚Äù The hallway is full of Throne‚Äôs men dead blood painting the marble tiles and splattered across the walls.   ‚ÄúWho could have done such butchery?‚Äù Alfred asks. Batwoman check the body of one of the men.   Batwoman stands up‚Äù judging by the smell of decomposing and state of the bodies the time of death was 72 hours ago.‚Äù She passed by the remaining bodies until she comes to two large wooden doors with blood splattered and a dagger embedded in it. She pushes it and across the room his the master bed with Rupert Throne‚Äôs body.  ‚ÄúThat smell he‚Äôs been here for just as long.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDear Lord and no one knew.‚Äù   She scans his body and finds a large gash in his chest.   ‚ÄúHe was stabbed with a sword.‚Äù She scans his hand and find gun power. She finds the gun on his bed and she able to tell he used it.  She looks at the door and sees blood. She scans it and it doesn‚Äôt match the blood from the hallway or Rupert‚Äôs. She finds a blood trail the leads to the balcony. Old bloody bandages are found along with the bullet.  ‚ÄúSeems like whoever was there wasn‚Äôt able to do the job without getting injured. I can‚Äôt track any blood trails it been to long and the rain has washed it away.‚Äù   ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already notified Ms. Gordon she‚Äôs in route.   Batwoman looks toward the city across the bridge. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs missing Alfred and I‚Äôm going to find out.‚Äù   ‚Äî‚Äî-  The Batmobile races through the waterfall and down the platform until it stop. Batwoman climbs out and takes the lift down toward the Batcomputer where Alfred sits and the computer with a cup of tea.  ‚ÄúAnd how was the rest of the night ma‚Äôam?‚Äù She pulls off the cowl and pushes her dark locks from her face.   ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs assassins back in the city.‚Äù She begins typing and pulls up the three other crime scenes.  The two look at each one. A victim with either a single large gash or several closely net ones are the on the screen.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the small killer the one that killed Throne and his men are different than these three. These victims were struggling and suffered. Throne‚Äôs was quick.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAs quick as having a sword shoved into your chest can be I presume.‚Äù H sips his tea and stands with his cane. He moved quietly as he always did but a little more slower.   Y/n sighs ‚ÄúIs he awake?‚Äù  Alfred stops at the elevator and nods. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been up for sometime I‚Äôll prepare breakfast.‚Äù  Y/n stands up and was to the display cases. All different suits.  Starting with a few of Bruce‚Äôs old suits then the original Robin and Batgirl suits. Finally she stops at of last suits. Bruce‚Äôs last suit was in mint condition as he left it.   She turns to the empty case and start placing her gear in it.  ‚Äî-  She emerges from the office and ties her hair up waking into the kitchen.   ‚ÄúMommy!‚Äù A little boy with brown hair and blue eyes smile with syrup all over his face. Y/n wipes his cheeks and smiles.  ‚ÄúDid you sleep well?‚Äù The five year old boy nods while eating his food.   ‚ÄúFinish up so I can take you to school.‚Äù She walks toward Alfred who‚Äôs making a plate for her.   ‚ÄúIt still feels weird to leave her sometimes.‚Äù She takes the mug from him as well and sips on her coffee.  ‚ÄúMaster Bruce wanted to be sure you were safe while he was gone. I don‚Äôt think he indeed for it to be permanent but he enjoyed the company as do I.‚Äù Y/n rolled her eyes.   ‚ÄúIf you say so though I will say we enjoy it with you Alfred. Even considering the circumstances.‚Äù Alfred gives her a weak smile and begins washing dishes.  ‚ÄúI guess most Assistants don‚Äôt get his kind of attention or is it due to the fact I keep Bruce on his toes.‚Äù   Alfred smiles ‚ÄúIt had been sometime since someone annoyed him the way you did and I think it loved having someone to color with again.‚Äù He glances at Rowan who has finished his food and brings the plate to Alfred.  ‚ÄúWhat do we say Rowan?‚Äù  ‚ÄúThank you Alfie.‚Äù He sings. Alfred smiles warmly at the kid.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very welcome now run along and get your shoes so you can go to school.‚Äù Rowan runs out the room and Y/n hums.  ‚ÄúThese Assassins do you think they killed Bruce?‚Äù She asks. The room is still.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I must say I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. I‚Äôll contact Ms. Gordon and see if she has any information.‚Äù   Y/n places her mug down and walks to the foyer where Rowan has his shoes on with his backpack.  She slides into her sneakers and grabs her keys. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go kid.‚Äù  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-  After dropping off Rowan Y/n pushed through the doors of Wayne Enterprises. Some of the staff waved at her while some held other emotions.   She walked past the front desk and into the elevator towards the top floor. She is met the receptionist Sara who doesn‚Äôt look up from her computer.   ‚ÄúGood Morning do you have an appointment with Mr. Fox?‚Äù  ‚ÄúReally Sara.‚Äù The ginger grins and looks toward the woman.   ‚ÄúHow are you hun?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good about as good as anyone.‚Äù The double doors open and Lucius waves her inside.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk with you later.‚Äù Y/n walked into the large office where Lucius turned to an old chest table and unlocked hidden elevator. They take it down in the underground bunker.  ‚ÄúSo what have you crafted this time?‚Äù She grins with her arms crossed over her chest eyeing the new prototypes.   He nods takes a blue batarang he throws it and it instantly electrifies the dummy.   ‚ÄúFancy.‚Äù   Lucius picks up a device and hands it over to Y/n. ‚ÄúThis was something Bruce wanted crafted I‚Äôm still getting it fine tuned but it‚Äôs useable. Alfred filled me on our new decline of population use it and it will instantly capture and give a small concentrated burst of energy to those wrapped in it. Should help should you get out numbered by assassins.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHow thoughtful I appreciate it. Though I‚Äôm sure you giving me new tech isn‚Äôt the only reason you wanted to see me so soon. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù  He takes a seat and sighs. ‚ÄúBruce‚Äôs memorial is next week. They‚Äôre gonna be some changes with stuff around here. Now I‚Äôm not leaving per se but with him‚Ä¶gone. My attention will need to be focused more on the business side for a while. I‚Äôve asked Luke to come home he‚Äôll be helping craft some more stuff for you while I‚Äôm busy.‚Äù  She nods. ‚ÄúI understand I appreciate you still being able to help.‚Äù  He gets to his feet slowly ‚ÄúMy kids now I‚Äôd never leave this unless I died. But with his services coming there are something‚Äôs that will change for you too I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI asked what will happen to the manor and the cave. Alfred it‚Äôs not just his decisionwhat does that mean?‚Äù  Lucius nods ‚ÄúBruce‚Äôs son will have to decide what will become of his estate. And they‚Äôll all have to agreenot sure how that‚Äôll go.‚Äù  The exit the elevator and the office returns to normal. ‚ÄúLet me know how the device works.‚Äù Y/n thanks him before leaving and returning to the manor.  She immediately enters the cave where Alfred is waiting.   ‚ÄúMs. Gordon is on the line for you.‚Äù Y/n sits her purse down and answers.  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong Commissioner?‚Äù   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna believe this the mayor was just killed in his office. How fast can you get down here?‚Äù   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  Batwoman emerges from the corner of the office. Barbara looks frustrated as the CSI team dust for prints take pictures and exam the mayor‚Äôs corpse.  ‚ÄúWhen did you find him?‚Äù Batwoman strolls toward the body as a few tech move away.  ‚ÄúJust after lunch his wife found him.‚Äù Batwoman scans the body. She notices the same claw marks and a golden dagger imbedded in his chest.   She takes it out and glances at it. The craftsmen was old but it was just as good as if it was made yesterday.  She returns to the Commissioner who she shows the blade to in a clear bag.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen it before can‚Äôt say it isn‚Äôt something new for use.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is a common killer this is the work of something more sinister.‚Äù Barbara nods and something catches her eye. It‚Äôs a small piece of paper with the same dagger holding it into the wall.  Batwoman takes it and unfolds the paper. She read it and turns to the Commissioner.   ‚ÄúI have to go.‚Äù Before Barbara can question her she‚Äôs already gone from the balcony.  ‚Äî‚Äî  As nightfall begins to sit in Batwoman lands on a rooftop of a hotel with the red neon lights of the building flashing.   She scans empty rooftop and comes to a stop she dodges left as three morning stars are sent flying. She throws smoke and evades another wave of the weapons.   She backflips from a sword attack and disarms the person causing them to stumble. She begins to fight the ninja and is hit a few times.  ‚ÄúYou are no match for me impostor.‚Äù She spats. The ninja kicks Batwoman back and she stumbles giving the ninja time to drive a dagger into his thigh.  ‚ÄúYou are nothing like your Predecessor. He was a lot more quicker.‚Äù She kick Batwoman who punches her in the side.  Ninja regains her balance and glares at her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll pay.‚Äù She picks up the sword and turns to the her.  ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù The ninja draws her blade at her throat.   ‚ÄúI am apart of the League of Assassins those who don‚Äôt want to be apart of the sorry and pathetic League it as become. Me and my faction are purists who only serve Ra Al Ghul and we will complete his mission. Neither you or this court will stop us.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äîcourt.‚Äù The ninja chuckles ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know the Court of Owls. Your predecessor was on to them before they killed him. They will try to take Gotham back but we will defeat them we already have the last known location of the Pits something they can‚Äôt recreate they‚Äôll to will bow before greatness‚Äî  Batwoman knocks the woman down and disarms her once more. The two are in a fight for the sword and Batwoman pulls the Assassin way and pulls off her mask.  The woman has a short black bob with a white strike throw her hair.  ‚ÄúWhoare you?‚Äù Batwoman huffs. She yells as a dagger is driven into her back.  ‚ÄúMistress are you hurt?‚Äù Another assassin yanks the blade out of Batwoman.  She grins ‚ÄúI am.‚Äù She gets her feet. ‚ÄúMy name will be the last thing you hear before the poison kills you I‚Äôm Nyssa and don‚Äôt worry about Gotham I‚Äôll take good care of it.‚Äù And true to her wound everything went blurry and fuzzy. The last thing Y/n felt was hot then cold and everything faded to black.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   The flashes of light sound of being and muffled voices come in and out before slowly Y/n wakes up in the cave to the faint beeping of machines. She sits up and groans as a hand is placed on her‚Äôs.   ‚ÄúBarbara?‚Äù The older woman nods and squeezes her hand.   ‚ÄúAre you alright the poison nearly killed you?‚Äù Y/n tries to sit up but is pushed back down by Barbara.  ‚ÄúYou need to rest Leslie and Alfred worked on you for hours to make you stable you need to give your body time to heal.‚Äù She offers her a cup of water which Y/n takes in on gulp.  ‚ÄúWho got me off the rooftop?‚Äù Her voice is gruff.   ‚ÄúNo Alfred called in some help.‚Äù They both turned to a woman Y/n never wanted to see at least she hoped.  ‚ÄúHi kitten.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHelloSelina.‚Äù Barbara wheeled out of the room and Selina drew closer taking her spot.   ‚ÄúAlfred called me he was worried. I happened to be back in‚Äî‚Äú  ‚Äú‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt care why you‚Äôre back or what you‚Äôve come to steal. I don‚Äôt want your help.‚Äù Selina kept a somewhat vague smile.   ‚ÄúI understand you hate me for leaving you-‚Äú  ‚ÄúMy entire life was spent in and out of neighbors houses in the system because you kept getting sent back to Blackgate. You were never there for me you or my father you talked on and on about. I‚Äôm twenty-five and still don‚Äôt know who he is or was knowing you. So I don‚Äôt need your help. Not now and not again.‚Äù Y/n laid back down and grumbled in pain turning to look at her monitor. ‚ÄúYou can go Selina.‚Äù   Selina nodded and exited the room. A few moments later Alfred entered and sighed.  ‚ÄúMs. (L/N) You do know the extent of your injury. I needed to remind you what could have happened if Ms. Kyle wasn‚Äôt in the vicinity?‚Äù   ‚Äú‚Ä¶.‚Äù  He sighs‚ÄùVery well while you were done Ms. Gordon and I had to find the Assassin next move. They‚Äôre going to kill everyone in their way in order to defeat one another I hate to say it but we do need the assistance.‚Äù  If looks could Alfred thought to himself. ‚ÄúI assume you I‚Äôm not referring to Miss Kyle you‚Äôre going to need more than one person to help you take on two deadly threats.‚Äù   Against his advice Y/n gets to her feet and exits the medical bay and made a beeline for the computer and begins typing away until four files appear on screen.  ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt talk much about them.‚Äù She mumbles to herself.  ‚ÄúThey all had their own problems and struggles with Master Bruce. But they all knew when he needed the help I just pray you‚Äôll ask unlike he wouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù   ‚ÄúWhere can I find themmost of these files are four years old and no known addresses for any of them?‚Äù  Alfred moved to the side as Barbara wheeled up to the computer and began typing away as if no time had passed.  ‚ÄúDick will be easy to find maybe not to recruit. He owns a martial art and gymnastic studio in East Bludheaven. Tim lives in New York he mostly keeps quiet with attending tech events. The others will take me time to find them they tend to go off the grid.‚Äù  Y/n nod ‚ÄúI drive out in the morning‚Äî‚Äú  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you to Bludheaven myself I‚Äôve asked Ms. Gordon to look after Master Rowan for a few nights if that‚Äôs okay will you?‚Äù  Y/n nods‚Äù I‚Äôll pack.‚Äù  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  Stepping onto the curb as a sharp wind bits through the air. Y/n pushes open the door into a dojo. A group of kids are doing routines.  She watches for a moment taking in the warm environment before someone walks behind her.  ‚ÄúAre you picking up or are you just here for the classes?‚Äù She turns to see a man in his late thirties.

They admire and misinterpret his traits as endorsements of their toxic masculinity. Online they share images of Batman with stuff like ‚ÄúBe the Alpha Be the Batman‚Äù. They even use the word Batmen as a synonym to Alpha Male. ‚ÄúReal Batmen don‚Äôt show weakness‚Äù.  When Bruce becomes aware of this he hates it. He despises them for all their messed up views knowing they completely misunderstand his principles. Batman‚Äôs true strength lies in his commitment to justice empathy and respect for all individuals values that are fundamentally opposed to the toxic masculinity they promote. Bruce is determined to distance his image from their rhetoric seeing them as nothing more than sexist and homophobic idiots.  So he decides to be a tiny tiny bit more Brucie when they appear in public. Not in form but in substance :  When he‚Äôs asked a question he tries to go ‚ÄúI have no clue I‚Äôd have to ask Black Canary.‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd have to see what Wonder Woman thinks about that‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis time we really couldn‚Äôt have done anything anything at all without Supergirl.‚Äù  Also Batman becomes more visibly affectionate with Superman.

They claimed that Tim Drake liking a guy introduces sexual content to a medium marketed to kids. I mentioned the constant sexualization of female characters and the multiples times that Batman has canonically fucked and that was their reply. Also objectively funny that they think only comics with gay people in them are political (say hello to Captain America punching Hitler everyone) and that they assume every comic book fan is straight.     ‚ÄúThe problem is is that there are no actual artists or writers who are writing gay people in the stories just activists who want to push their personal brand and politics at the expense of storytelling.‚Äù  I directed them to the numerous amazing comic books with queer characters (Batwoman Runaways everything with Loki) and pointed out the multiple renowmed comic book writers who are queer (Grant Morrison James Tynion IV the usual roster) and because this was about Robin mentioned that the late and great Kevin Conroy was married to a man.

So far they have coined the phrase ‚Äúhomo-fascist snowflakes‚Äù told me to get back on my meds and stated that gay people have more rights than straight people.     Some fun quotes from the bigots:  ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a tissue wipe the blood from your tongue.‚Äù   This one‚Äôs kinda fire actually     ‚ÄúAre you ok upstairs child? Skipped any meds recently?‚Äù  Unoriginal and inaccurate. I‚Äôm on way too much meds.     ‚ÄúLast time I checked gays had more rights than the straights and whole government spend more backwards to appease them especially in the UK.‚Äù   I guess someone doesn‚Äôt pay attention to the news or knows how transphobic the legislation of their country is.     ‚ÄúYeah because that‚Äôs is normal. When we read comics we want to see things that are fantastic wish fulfillment not the writers personal politics or agendas.‚Äù  Some context. They claimed that Tim Drake liking a guy introduces sexual content to a medium marketed to kids. I mentioned the constant sexualization of female characters and the multiples times that Batman has canonically fucked and that was their reply. Also objectively funny that they think only comics with gay people in them are political (say hello to Captain America punching Hitler everyone) and that they assume every comic book fan is straight.     ‚ÄúThe problem is is that there are no actual artists or writers who are writing gay people in the stories just activists who want to push their personal brand and politics at the expense of storytelling.‚Äù  I directed them to the numerous amazing comic books with queer characters (Batwoman Runaways everything with Loki) and pointed out the multiple renowmed comic book writers who are queer (Grant Morrison James Tynion IV the usual roster) and because this was about Robin mentioned that the late and great Kevin Conroy was married to a man.

Rok Soo who can‚Äôt emote for shit but proves in ways that baffle emotionally incompetent Bruce to his core that he still loves and cares for people deeply beyond what he can express. Like lil baby Rok Soo who knows Bruce is Batman who doesn‚Äôt hide from this knowledge but also very firmly keeps himself away from the nightlife because his brand of self-preservation is usually pretty good. (Until it really really isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶) Rok Soo who schemes and has dollar signs for eyes and who indulges in the one form of love Bruce is 100% comfortable showing and utilising (Gift Giving|| Get that bag Rok Soo!) Very cute dynamic I admit.   But I think it just. Would be 100% better if KRS was adopted but also still like. A full grown adult. Because Buff Bruce and Buff Rok Soo giving Brucie puppy eyes for some more money? And Bruce thinking he‚Äôs finally got a child who won‚Äôt give him a heart attack just for Rok Soo to set bombs off with Red Robin bc someone was being a bit too creepy about Damian in their presence.

34,Batman,['dc'  'dc comics'  'abnormal nights in gotham'  'oswald cobblepot'  'dc penguin'  'gotham'  'dc riddler'  'edward nygma'  'harvey dent'  'dc two face'],ang-artblog,The Penguin was another one of those characters I was pleasantly surprised by when I heard Nick voice him. I feel like Nick captured exactly what I wanted him to sound like and all I told him was ‚Äúa mix between the Arkham game series Penguin and the Batman audio adventures Penguin.‚Äù Like the Mad Hatter and Killer Moth he didn‚Äôt have much of a story until I heard Nick voice him. I really have to give credit where credit is due when it comes to some of these characters because without these voice actors I probably would‚Äôve just make half of these rouges two-dimensional and have one purpose for the story. They basically are my entire motivation to continue writing the scripts for episodes when I don‚Äôt really feel like it and they are really encouraging so thanks to the voice actors!!  Character-wise I wanted to play off of the riddler and have a contrast between the two because of how much they interact. Both are very smart rich and successful in their own way. The thing that sets them apart is that they have a different ‚Äútype of narcissism.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know the technical terms (that‚Äôs for later script writer me to find out) but Ernest will talk about this more in season 2. Oswald is the type of narcissist that views himself as above everyone but is driven through insecurity and a craving for attention. Edward is the type of narcissist that won‚Äôt gloat over others and say he‚Äôs better directly but rather manipulates and hurt people because he believes he is better than them. His narcissism is driven through his past inferiority even if he denies it.  This dynamic also is played off with Two Face being his character is all about his internal battle against himself and his drive to help. Oswald is so full of himself he sometimes does things for his gain and doesn‚Äôt realize the consequences until it‚Äôs too late. This causes their alliance to be unstable which is the only thing keeping these two from trying to kill each other all the time.  I like the play with relationship dynamics like these a lot so this type of dynamic where ‚Äúthey could be the same person but what sets them apart is ‚Äù is seen a lot. Calendar Man and Ellie Poison Ivy and Two Face Oliver Ruby-Blu and Ace Paige the list goes on.  Anyways there‚Äôs my yapping for the day,2024-07-09 12:30:50 GMT

Don‚Äôt have much to say to this just:   Tim Drake and Kim Rok Soo would hate each other on account of being the same sort of control freak over-planning under-sharing asshole. And I was thinking about them hating each other but causing the same brand of unmitigated morally dubious chaos and then I thought to my self‚Ä¶.   Huh‚Ä¶ Rok Soo is a dark haired orphan with a tragic back story a love for money and a tendency towards costumed vigilantism.   And then:   Bruce Wayne adopts KRS???    And yeah it could be Bruce adopts lil kid KRS who is still too smart for his own good but is a weedy little shit who can‚Äôt fight to save his own life and cares so much about people. Rok Soo who can‚Äôt emote for shit but proves in ways that baffle emotionally incompetent Bruce to his core that he still loves and cares for people deeply beyond what he can express. Like lil baby Rok Soo who knows Bruce is Batman who doesn‚Äôt hide from this knowledge but also very firmly keeps himself away from the nightlife because his brand of self-preservation is usually pretty good. (Until it really really isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶) Rok Soo who schemes and has dollar signs for eyes and who indulges in the one form of love Bruce is 100% comfortable showing and utilising (Gift Giving|| Get that bag Rok Soo!) Very cute dynamic I admit.   But I think it just. Would be 100% better if KRS was adopted but also still like. A full grown adult. Because Buff Bruce and Buff Rok Soo giving Brucie puppy eyes for some more money? And Bruce thinking he‚Äôs finally got a child who won‚Äôt give him a heart attack just for Rok Soo to set bombs off with Red Robin bc someone was being a bit too creepy about Damian in their presence. And Rok Soo looking like the tankest of tanks but still being the weakest in the BatFam because like‚Ä¶He trained to survive these fuckers relish in this chaos.   Idk man I just think it would be a funny cute lil thing.,2024-07-09 11:08:21 GMT
20,Batman,['bruce wayne'  'joker'  'suicide squad'],unreversedumbrella,the Batman Canon vs Fanon poll reminded me of a ‚Äúfunny‚Äù story. in middle school i was taking a painting extracurricular class with a girl obcessed with suicide squad (2016). long story short she was painting a version of this ugly thing  at some point she asks outloud what color she should use for higlights and I quickly say: ‚Äúwhy not purple. the joker wears a purple suit‚Äù to which she confidently replied ‚Äúno he doesn‚Äôt!‚Äù   she did agree that purple was a good color but i was dumbfounded. i‚Äôm not - and have never been - a joker fan. at the time i wasn‚Äôt even a comic book fan. but the idea that someone didn‚Äôt know joker‚Äôs iconic purple suit was appalling to me. but you see truth be told the girl wasn‚Äôt thinking about the joker. she was thinking about the guy on the right  im not totally against people enjoying fanon content - how could I? my biggest hobbie is being obcessed with a character from the 90‚Äôs while ignoring everything published after 2002. but people need to understand that sometimes this is what fanon content looks like. completelly baseless statements and charecterizations spread around as if they were canon oftentimes contradiction canon itself,2024-07-09 11:04:20 GMT

10,Batman,['disney'  'amphibia'  'sprig plantar'  'superhero'],scottpetersen,Honestly I think that Sprig adopting a superhero persona in the episode ‚ÄòSpider Sprig‚Äô was pretty fitting since Sprig fits both the campy and silly and the dark and grim sides of being a superhero. After all as shown in the episode ‚ÄòHandy Anne‚Äô Sprig had all kinds of gimmicky slingshots and having gimmicky weapons was a common trope for superheroes as shown in Detective Comics Vol 1 #244 back during the Silver Age Of Comics where the superhero Batman had all kinds of gimmicky batarangs. And on a darker note as shown in the episode ‚ÄòAfter The Rain‚Äô Sprig lost his parents at a very young age and losing a loved one is also a common trope for a superhero‚Äôs origin story as shown in the Batman Year One comic where Batman also lost his parents at a very young age.,2024-07-09 14:49:22 GMT

Mysteries issue #5 by Mathew Cody 5/5  This post is for fan entertainment I‚Äôm not being paid.  Ok I won‚Äôt lie I love this issue it takes place in the classic creepy haunted house but something that I will bring up in this issue. That the art of this Batman is different from the last 3 issues (that I have) I can‚Äôt really pinpoint the design of Batman and Robin designs in issue 4 but issue 5 this Batman looks like he steps out of The Animated Series (I prefer this one but I love the Animated series a lot that‚Äôs childhood.) Along with Kirk Langstrom.  This issue focuses on Batman trying to help one of his rouges Dr. Kirk Langstrom.    Dr. Langstrom is trying to find a cure for his whole Man-Bat situation and they tracked down a scientist named‚Ä¶Dr. Jekyll he believes that the research that Dr. Jekyll is the key to stopping the Man-Bat transformation.  Now just some clarification this Dr. Jekyll looks like the Dr. Jekyll from the episode ‚ÄúNowhere to Hyde‚Äù from the Scooby-Doo series Scooby-Doo Where Are You! (I tracked down the information through my Scooby-Doo Encyclopedia and Scooby-Doo Wiki click here to read it this was a very good episode)  Batman has invited Mystery Inc. to help him and Dr Langstrom in looking for the research because Mystery Inc. has been inside the mansion before.  So once in the mansion what does everyone do they spilt the party Langstrom Shaggy &amp; Scooby get the basement Fred and Daphne got the library/upstairs and Batman and Velma get the main floor.  However poor Shaggy and Scooby have to deal with Man-Bat  Now I am leaving this issue here because this issue is one of my favorites because it‚Äôs not centered around anything in the Batman mythos but more of the Mystery Inc. mythos.  For the people that haven‚Äôt seen the episode where Dr. Jekyll was introduced I don‚Äôt want to spoil technically two mysteries.,2024-07-09 15:32:38 GMT

I swear I‚Äôm too small-fry to sue  Thanks to Batgirlspain for the inspiration  (All videos are courtesy of Batman: The Animated Series)  Introduced in 1967 (one year before her first televised appearance) Batgirl is hailed as a feminist icon and a mainstay in the Bat Family (in fact in New Adventures she was in the opening credits alongside the Dynamic Duo from the first episode)  But it was over 15 years after New Adventures that Batgirl would return to the small screen in the Dini-verse (I will NOT be discussing her time on the Big Screen) and though the Caped Crusaders don‚Äôt learn her identity and fully integrate her into the Bat Family until New Batman Adventures she was able to hold her own against Two-Face and clear her father Commissioner Gordon‚Äôs name in her first ever case.  This is the tale of her second case. If you would like to watch it it‚Äôs available on Max or behind your favorite paywall.  We open at Gotham State University where‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¶a priceless jade cat statue is stolen from the University museum.  Meanwhile Batman is in trouble (the deadly kind) from‚Ä¶  Oh this can‚Äôt be good. Fortunately Batgirl is on hand to send them running. Batman is grateful.  ‚Ä¶wow!   But just before they kiss‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¶Barbara Gordon is woken from her dream by Dick Grayson wanting to take her out for a pizza. She politely declines and is about to return to her nap studies when the evening paper is slid under get door.  Suddenly her studies don‚Äôt seem so important.  Later at Gotham University Museum there‚Äôs another break-in.  Catwoman examines the display where the statue was when Batgirl emerges from the shadows accusing her of the crime. Catwoman points out that the method of the theft (using acid on the security) isn‚Äôt her style.  Batgirl decides to believe that she didn‚Äôt do it (but not that she wouldn‚Äôt) when‚Ä¶  Catwoman takes the opportunity to retreat but Robin (with Batgirl in tow) chases after her. However Catwoman snares Robin and escapes. Robin blames Batgirl.  Who knew robins were so territorial?  The next day Barbara sees a cat-shaped message on the student bulletin board addressed to ‚ÄúThe Winged Mouse‚Äù (Catwoman called Batgirl ‚Äúa mouse with wings‚Äù the previous night)  That evening at Bayshore Pier Batgirl arrives to find Catwoman waiting complimenting Batgirl on her abilities.  Since she and Catwoman want to recover the jade cat Batgirl agrees‚Ä¶ on the condition that Catwoman surrender to the police if Batgirl finds out she‚Äôs lying (like she‚Äôd keep her end of the bargain)  Meanwhile at the Batcave Bruce is in Paris on WayneCorp business meaning Robin is on his own to deal with Catwoman (OK Batgirl is also on the case but he‚Äôs not thrilled about that either)  Elsewhere Catwoman has taken Batgirl to a dive bar.  After getting the bar‚Äôs attention‚Ä¶  Catwoman and Batgirl corner a thug known as ‚ÄúThe Chemist‚Äù and ask about the acid residue. He spooks and runs off prompting every thug in the joint to get involved.  Fortunately Robin is on hand to help Batgirl. After taking out the trash Batgirl realizes Catwoman is missing.    Naturally she‚Äôs gone after Daggett. After convincing him to hand over the statue he attacks her! Unfortunately he goes over the railing and falls toward a vat of acid! (isn‚Äôt one Joker enough?) Fortunately‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¶his leg is tangled in a hanging chain breaking his fall. Unfortunately Catwoman is interested in revenge and slowly lowers Daggett toward the vat. Fortunately Batgirl is on hand and takes the chain from her. Unfortunately that means Catwoman can run away with the statue. Fortunately Robin is on hand.  He sends Batgirl after Catwoman while he finishes hauling up Daggett.  On the rooftops Catwoman is about to make her escape when‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¶she‚Äôs snared by Batgirl.  Catwoman offers to make their partnership official but Batgirl declines and reminds Catwoman about their agreement at the beginning of the episode.  Surprisingly Catwoman agrees though she regrets Batgirl turned down her offer.  However  the police car holding Catwoman stops not 100 feet away and the cops are kicked out.  Well played Ms. Kyle!  With that Catwoman drives off into the sunset.  I do enjoy the chemistry between Batgirl and Catwoman. I may have to review their interactions again!,2024-07-09 15:02:00 GMT

10,Batman,['disney'  'amphibia'  'sprig plantar'  'superhero'],scottpetersen,Honestly I think that Sprig adopting a superhero persona in the episode ‚ÄòSpider Sprig‚Äô was pretty fitting since Sprig fits both the campy and silly and the dark and grim sides of being a superhero. After all as shown in the episode ‚ÄòHandy Anne‚Äô Sprig had all kinds of gimmicky slingshots and having gimmicky weapons was a common trope for superheroes as shown in Detective Comics Vol 1 #244 back during the Silver Age Of Comics where the superhero Batman had all kinds of gimmicky batarangs. And on a darker note as shown in the episode ‚ÄòAfter The Rain‚Äô Sprig lost his parents at a very young age and losing a loved one is also a common trope for a superhero‚Äôs origin story as shown in the Batman Year One comic where Batman also lost his parents at a very young age.,2024-07-09 14:49:22 GMT

You know what the Pit didn‚Äôt take care of?‚Äù Dick flipped out of Jason‚Äôs grasp landing behind him with his hands on Jason‚Äôs sides. ‚ÄúThe tips of your ears still turn red when you‚Äôre lying.‚Äù  Dick squeezed his sides and Jason lurched forward with a gasp he couldn‚Äôt quite strangle. Dick spidered his hands up to Jason‚Äôs ribs and this time Jason didn‚Äôt manage to stifle his snickers.  ‚ÄúFuhuhck off Dihihckhead I‚Äôm not in the mohohood.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAwwww Little Wing you might be worse than when you were a kiddo!‚Äù Dick teased watching delightedly as red crept up the back of his little brother‚Äôs neck.  Jason quickly decided that was enough of that thank you and spun around tackling his older brother to the ground. ‚ÄúMahahybe. But unluckily for you I‚Äôve got ahabout 40 pounds on you these days.‚Äù  Dick barely had time to wheeze out a shocked ‚ÄúShit!‚Äù before Jason dug his fingers into Dick‚Äôs underarms and vibrated his fingers back and forth.  Dick immediately burst into cackles. ‚ÄúWAHAHAIT WAIT NOHOHOHO‚Äù he managed his pleas echoing around the cave.  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong Dickie? Can dish it out but can‚Äôt take it?‚Äù Jason asked removing one hand from under his arms to scribble across his brother‚Äôs tummy.  ‚ÄúJahahahahahay Jahahay plehehehehehease Ihihih‚Äôm sohohohorry!‚Äù  ‚ÄúMmm yeah I don‚Äôt care‚Äù Jason said as he reached down to grab one of Dick‚Äôs thighs and squeeze.  Dick hollered begging as his little brother showed no mercy to his worst spot. He writhed trying to escape but apparently more than a decade of vigilante work flew out the window when his brother was murdering him with tickles.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget Dickie I‚Äôm the biggest one in the family now‚Äù Jason taunted giving his brother a break by scritching at his knees not wanting him to actually pass out.  Suddenly there was a shadow looming over Jason‚Äôs shoulder. A deep voice rumbled ‚ÄúBiggest save for one Jaylad‚Äù before Jason was unceremoniously tackled to the mats off of his older brother.  Jason could do little more than suck in a breath before his adoptive father was attacking his ribs with frightening precision. Jason threw his head back as ticklish shocks swarmed his senses laughing like a loon.   ‚ÄúFuhuhuhuhUCK! SHIHIHIT DAHAMMIT B WAHAHAHAHIT!‚Äù   ‚ÄúMmmm no thank you.‚Äù His father said fondly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been altogether too long since I‚Äôve heard you laugh.‚Äù  ‚ÄúGet him B!‚Äù Dick cheered tiredly from the sidelines still recovering from his own torment.  ‚ÄúFUHUHUCK OHOHOHOFF DIHIHIHICKHEAD!‚Äù Jason bellowed as Bruce attacked his underarms ruthlessly.  ‚ÄúDo you remember what I used to do to get you to screech like a banshee?‚Äù Bruce asked grinning down at his second-eldest son. ‚ÄúAlfred came running with his shotgun the first time I did it.‚Äù  Jason‚Äôs eyes widened and he started fighting back even harder. ‚ÄúNohohoho nohohot thahat plehehease B I cahahahan‚Äôt - ‚Äú he babbled as Bruce slowly ruched up his workout top exposing his tummy.   Bruce smiled as Jason sucked in his tummy as far as it would go shaking his head back and forth. He leaned down keeping eye contact with his frantic kid before taking in a deep breath and blowing a raspberry right over Jason‚Äôs belly button.  ‚ÄúNAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA‚Äù Jason arched off the ground his head thrown back as his hysterical laughter filled the cave. ‚ÄúPLEHEHEHEHEHE - DAHAHAHAHAD I CAHAHAHAHAHAN‚ÄôT!‚Äù  Bruce took one more breath knowing Jason was close to his limit before ducking back down and blowing one final raspberry shaking his head back and forth so that his stubble would catch on his son‚Äôs skin and tickle even more.  Jason‚Äôs laughter went silent tears beading in the corners of his eyes as he rode out the ticklish sensations. Bruce sat up and pulled Jason‚Äôs shirt back into place still grinning as his son‚Äôs laughter continued. Jason curled into a ball still giggling arms firmly around his tummy to guard against any more attacks but none were coming.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs too precious‚Äù Dick stage-whispered sitting up and mirroring Bruce‚Äôs fond expression. Then at a normal volume ‚ÄúStill want to try and convince me the Pit ‚Äòtook care of it‚Äô?‚Äù  Jason still giggling uncurled one arm enough to flip Dick the bird.  Dick still wasn‚Äôt done. ‚ÄúIs it true that Alfred ran in with a shotgun the first time you gave him a raspberry?‚Äù he asked Bruce smirking.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd ever seen him move that fast‚Äù Bruce remembered then yelped as the butler in question appeared behind him and deftly scribbled across the back of Bruce‚Äôs neck.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll remind you of my extensive knowledge of your own spots Master Bruce‚Äù Alfred sniffed reprovingly handing bottles of water to Jason and Dick as Bruce rubbed away the ghost tickles.  Jason panting but recovered enough to sit upright smirked. ‚ÄúAlfie‚Äôs got my back. ‚ÄòSpecially against you cheaters.‚Äù  ‚ÄúQuite so Master Jason.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhatever you say Jaybird.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOf course Jaylad.‚Äù  ‚ÄúFuck off.‚Äù,2024-07-09 18:23:54 GMT

And now imagine Tim and Bernard noticing that they were the cause of the flowers pouring from Kon‚Äôs lips and so Tim asks around only to find out that the reason is because of unrequited love.  So imagine Tim and Bernard working together to try and ease Kon‚Äôs suffering and the two slowly falling in love with Kon in turn.

You know I do get he chokes the Joker majority of the times but there‚Äôs just something strange about him choking him this way.  Why is he wiggling him so much? Why not just squeeze his neck??? But at this point he‚Äôs basically toying with the Joker‚Äôs neck. It‚Äôs also how he holds his head up and keeps it in place but still manage to wiggle him. I just don‚Äôt understand why all the wiggling?? It‚Äôs also strange that Bruce wriggles his head around until he glides him closer to his face. I don‚Äôt understand that either?? Why did he need to get so close to his face? The Joker eyes is closed guys. Although let‚Äôs not look over the fact that Bruce is eating this man alive with his eyes and on top of that the Joker eyes remains close even after Bruce‚Äôs pushes him back. I mean look at this shit? He looks at the Joker‚Äôs lips and then his hand on the Joker‚Äôs neck. Like tell me I‚Äôm not crazy. Bruce where‚Äôs the anger at? I don‚Äôt see any here. I mean look at this man his eyes is closed and he‚Äôs pleased Do not tell me that‚Äôs not an eye roll. Theses two are in some kinky shit even the guard is looking away.

And as antithetical as it is to every action he‚Äôs ever taken in his life he welcomes the feeling lets it become a part of him. As dangerous as it could be as paranoid as he feels about it‚Ä¶ he trusts Clark. Trusts him with the parts of him that he can‚Äôt even bring himself to acknowledge. As clich√© as it sounds trusting Clark with everything in him seems to him to be the only option an path he‚Äôs already been on for years before he‚Äôd ever acknowledged that he could never go back.    - - -    Already the loneliness seems to seize him seemingly confirming his fears about becoming too attached too dependent on Clark emotionally in ways he cannot handle. But his thoughts seem to wander to Clark‚Äôs smile the look in his eyes full of light. And Batman is a slave to his feelings after all because the urge to hold him close to put himself entirely in his hands to trust Clark with everything in him overpowers every other thought every other sense like it‚Äôs all he knows.

Dick becomes ‚ÄúRickey‚Äù and turns into a mindless himbo. Everyone hits on him and he‚Äôs basically like a mini Brucie. Craziest thing he‚Äôs done as Rickey- knocked down a 6 foot tall champagne tower and no one got mad. ÔøºÔøº  Tim has been working on his persona since he was about 12. He realized what Bruce was doing one time and started to follow his lead before he even became Robin. Tim becomes brainless but still somehow still manages to make the rudest comments. No one really brings that up though because well the kid dropped out of high school. Obviously he isn‚Äôt the smartest the kid just doesn‚Äôt understand what he‚Äôs saying. Craziest thing he‚Äôs done- threatened Lex Luther to keep his gadgets in Metropolis in front of Clark Kent and Lois Lane.   Jason doesn‚Äôt go to galas let‚Äôs be so real. Even when he did when he was younger Jason was so sweet to everyone. It wasn‚Äôt even an act he was just happy to eat all the fancy party food. Craziest thing he did as a kid- someone once accused him of stealing a purse Jason gave them the puppy dog eyes and they were taking it back.   Steph just turns her regular personality up to ten. The upper class is afraid of her because they think that‚Äôs just how she is all the time. Whenever she does something outrageous at a party they give Bruce looks of pity because she must do this all the time. Craziest thing she‚Äôs done- pulled a toupee clean off a guys head. She then proceeded to throw it in the chocolate fondue machine.   The only kid who doesn‚Äôt make up a different personality to the media is Damian. This has led to many different twitter accounts that‚Äôs sole purpose is to show all the time Damian has suffered to his crazy dad/siblings. The hashtag ‚ÄòFreeDamianFromTheBullshit‚Äô has trended every single time the Waynes make a public appearance.,2024-07-10 03:12:51 GMT

Dick becomes ‚ÄúRickey‚Äù and turns into a mindless himbo. Everyone hits on him and he‚Äôs basically like a mini Brucie. Craziest thing he‚Äôs done as Rickey- knocked down a 6 foot tall champagne tower and no one got mad. ÔøºÔøº  Tim has been working on his persona since he was about 12. He realized what Bruce was doing one time and started to follow his lead before he even became Robin. Tim becomes brainless but still somehow still manages to make the rudest comments. No one really brings that up though because well the kid dropped out of high school. Obviously he isn‚Äôt the smartest the kid just doesn‚Äôt understand what he‚Äôs saying. Craziest thing he‚Äôs done- threatened Lex Luther to keep his gadgets in Metropolis in front of Clark Kent and Lois Lane.   Jason doesn‚Äôt go to galas let‚Äôs be so real. Even when he did when he was younger Jason was so sweet to everyone. It wasn‚Äôt even an act he was just happy to eat all the fancy party food. Craziest thing he did as a kid- someone once accused him of stealing a purse Jason gave them the puppy dog eyes and they were taking it back.   Steph just turns her regular personality up to ten. The upper class is afraid of her because they think that‚Äôs just how she is all the time. Whenever she does something outrageous at a party they give Bruce looks of pity because she must do this all the time. Craziest thing she‚Äôs done- pulled a toupee clean off a guys head. She then proceeded to throw it in the chocolate fondue machine.   The only kid who doesn‚Äôt make up a different personality to the media is Damian. This has led to many different twitter accounts that‚Äôs sole purpose is to show all the time Damian has suffered to his crazy dad/siblings. The hashtag ‚ÄòFreeDamianFromTheBullshit‚Äô has trended every single time the Waynes make a public appearance.,2024-07-10 03:12:51 GMT

A room in a wing that in other times had more people residing there; but as time had passed and the previous Master and Madam had passed away that wing had slowly but surely been emptied until only one inhabited remained. The room in itself was no fancy thing; it was an old room with a bathroom a bath and a small parlour ‚Äìthe only room to possess such an anteroom in the whole building-. The room had always belonged to the butler and head of staff of the Wayne household as it does today and would probably be as long as the house was in use.  The bedroom was not especially large just enough to hold the bare necessary furniture; the bathroom was nothing but practical and efficient to clean; as for the small parlour it was the largest of the small apartment. Yet it remained small and simple; two high-backed cushioned chairs of a faded maroon colour ‚Äìit wouldn‚Äôt be long before having to be refurbished- a wooden table between them large enough to hold a lamp a small plate ‚Äìthat might sometimes hold cookies and some others small cakes- a teapot and two tea cups with their respective plates. They all were facing towards a medium fireplace with an immaculate clean mantelpiece in which a set of pictures rest ‚Äìmost of them holding children sulking ones glaring ones smiling ones sleepy ones confused ones-. Hanging above the mantelpiece there‚Äôs a reproduction of The Evening Angel.  To each side of the fireplace there are paneled windows that by the late afternoon fill the small room with warm orange light in summer and autumn. A little bit to the left there‚Äôs a wooden door with a small window in its middle that leads to the orchard part of the gardens. On the right wall of the fireplace there are two bookcases full of books. On the left wall there‚Äôs the door of the bedroom and to its side a table that at its top there‚Äôs an electric kettle and several tin metal boxes and flasks filled with tea and aromatic herbs inside it behind two glass doors a set of teacups and teapots ‚Äìsome white some with delicate patterns some chipped ones-. Behind the high back chairs there is another bookcase ‚Äìthis one holds a Winchester Model 12 a Danish Butter Cookies tin can filled with sewing materials and some other mysterious baskets and boxes- and the door that leads to the inner narrow corridor of the service wing not too far down from this door there‚Äôs the door that leads to the kitchen and the service staircases that lead directly to the upper floors with the main bedrooms.  In this small room and humble room many have found refuge and comfort throughout the last years;  The brooding child who became a brooding man. He sits in silence while watching the fire ‚Äìwhen it‚Äôs lighted- or at The Evening Angel and drinks black tea.  The angry child who became a smiling man. He sits while chatting and laughing sometimes at others he resembles a certain silent brooding man. He drinks his tea with sugar and milk.  The lost child who became a broken man. He sits quietly while reading a book and answers the questions in his own time. He drinks whatever he is given which usually is calming and herbal.  The clever child who became a tired man. He sits talking quietly sometimes about meaningful things or sometimes about the last development in a case. He drinks sip after sip from soft green tea.  The silent child who became a wise woman. She doesn‚Äôt sit very long preparing the tea meticulously and in different manners according to their nature is how she spends her time. She loves pu-erh tea.  The violent child who became a caring man. He sits and draws in his sketchbook atop his crossed knee. Jazmine tea is his predilection and he refuses to take any other kind but he never refuses the sweetmeats.   When the tea is finished the empty cups stand forgotten with some leaves and darkened water on their bottom some crumbs remain on an empty plate and the two chairs eventually grow cold awaiting to be warmed again.,2024-07-10 05:34:41 GMT

Cock warming is definitely Bruce‚Äôs thing. He‚Äôd hold your hips down firmly to prevent you from squirming around. But how couldn‚Äôt you squirm around him? He fit perfectly inside you and you needed to move around to feel the way his veiny hard cock was inside of you. Tip practically touching your womb.      ‚ÄúStay still.‚Äù Bruce groaned while you practically sobbed for permission to start bouncing up and down his cock.   He had just left a battle with Harley Quinn. She could be a real bitch with that whiny squeaky toy like voice. Initially he had caught her doing the most common crime ever robbing a bank. He wrapped it up pretty quickly in under ten minutes or less but he was growing frustrated. He could only think of one thing on his mind and that was burying his cock deep into her walls. He wasted no time in quickly ending his patrol and speeding away through the night back to Wayne manor.   ‚ÄúBruce?‚Äù You had called out to him noticing a dark figure standing at your door way. You rubbed you eyes as you had slowly awoke from your slumber. He could only melt at the way your voice had called out to him. He shut the door behind him and walked over to you. He turned on the lamp light by your bedside drawer and watched you sit up. ‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù You had asked ‚ÄúIt always is.‚Äù Was the response.   You stood up from the bed and tiptoed to take off his mask. You threw it into your bed and caressed his face. ‚ÄúHow can I help?‚Äù You asked desperately feeling bad for Bruce. You always did taking care of the city was difficult enough. He walked over and sat down on the soft mattress. ‚ÄúHelp me darling.‚Äù He groaned softly as he pointed to his troublesome bulge poking out of his suit. A small smile appeared on your lips. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so amused.‚Äù He bit his tongue and watched you go on your knees and unbuckle his pants. He helped along by removing his gear and placing it next to his mask.   You took off his blue boxers and smiled seeing the way his cock had sprung up hard with precum practically spilling out. You licked the precum off from his tip and kissed his tip. He let out a soft groan and watched the way your hand slowly reached over towards his cock and stroke his veiny rough cock.  ‚ÄúTake off your shorts now. On top of me.‚Äù He commanded and you did exactly that before your warm mouth could start bobbing up and down on his dick. As much as he wanted that and paint your pretty face with his cum he wanted to bury his dick into your tight pussy way more.  As soon as you centered yourself on top of Bruce‚Äôs cock he firmly grabbed your hips and slid you down slowly into him before you could. Your moans were like music to his ears and he moaned along with you. Eventually you began to bounce but Bruce held you tightly down.   ‚ÄúNo. Tonight‚Äôs going to be me being inside this tight pussy. I‚Äôll move when I want to.‚Äù You could feel the prick of tears form and wrapped your arms around his shoulders. You had brought him closer. ‚ÄúBut Bruce!‚Äù You whined and he quickly shut you up with the best way he knew how kissing you. He slid his tongue and quickly explored.   You moaned into his mouth as both of your salivas trickled down from the corner of your lips. He had reached over behind you head and grabbed a fist full of hair and pulled you away. ‚ÄúMy bitch.‚Äù   Suddenly he slammed his hips into your tight pussy you jerked up and let out a sudden scream of pleasure. ‚ÄòPoor Alfred and Damian‚Äô you thought. Your heavy breathing and moans mixed along with his as he grabbed your ass firmly and stood up. This allowed him to make eye contact with you making you feel so small and pathetic in his embrace.  ‚ÄúFuck. You just enjoy the way my cock fits in you huh? My pussy. Mine.‚Äù He growled out. You two were a sweaty mess the way your hair began sticking to your forehead and your fingers began to dig your nails into his suit. Your moans echoed throughout the room as tears fell down your cheeks. A true pathetic slut. Exactly how Bruce wanted you to be.   He eventually got tired of this position and threw you onto the mattress. You spread your legs wide open and reached down to your wet pussy and spread the wetness across fingering yourself a bit and slipping in two fingers.   ‚ÄúNeed you now.‚Äù You cried and sniffled. He chuckled at the sight and walked over to you. He took off his suit and threw it in the corner of the room and centered his hips towards your wet pussy.   ‚ÄúTo believe that simple cock warming got you this wet.‚Äù He chuckled and slid himself into you so slowly it felt so delicious feeling the way you could just feel him balls deep inside of you. He gently fucked you at first lifting up your shirt and cupping your breast and flicking your nipples gently. He admired the way your dried up tears and slut face look had an effect on him.   He could feel it. You could feel it. The way his cock twitched inside your pussy. ‚ÄúFaster please!‚Äù You begged him. He wasted no time in fingering and flicking your clit and leaned down to kiss you. He pounded you and with his other free hand threw your leg over his shoulder. He broke off the kiss and looked into your eyes. ‚ÄúCum.‚Äù He simply said granting you the permission you so badly wanted. You too could feel the coil about to burst.   The way your walls clenched around his cock tighter and tighter. You both were a moaning and groaning mess. Heavy breathing and moans were only heard in the sex smelling room. Your legs began to shake slightly feeling your orgasm approaching slowly. You could practically feel your heart pounding in your head your body was heating up and you were thrusting yourself into him.   ‚ÄúNeed..to‚Ä¶cum!‚Äù You cried out and Bruce fingered you faster. He knew you were about to reach your climax and he was too. However he wanted you to cum first you first before anything. Your toes curled and you arched your back in pleasure when finally you felt the coil finally snap. Your orgasm had hit you in a way you‚Äôve never felt before in the three years you had been with Bruce.   ‚ÄúShit! Bruce I‚Äôm coming!‚Äù You sobbed and wrapped your arms around his shoulders and hugged him close. He had paused and let you cum around his cock. You shook violently under his body as he held you close and kissed your forehead. ‚ÄúBreathe my love‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered into your ear as you finally reached you high and began to calm down.  Your chest rose up and down and Bruce lifted himself up. He still needed to finish. He removed himself from you and flipped you around. ‚ÄúBruce?!‚Äù You exclaimed ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sensitive!‚Äù  He smiled and instantly inserted himself into your tight asshole. He groaned and pounded himself into you. You cried and moaned feeling so sensitive and good. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to cum!‚Äù He groaned and you could only smile happily. He groped and slapped your ass until his hands marked your pretty ass.  ‚ÄúFill me up please!‚Äù You sobbed out that was his breaking point. His cock twitched and with one final slam he filled you up with his cum deep inside your tight asshole. You hummed happily knowing that you two were finished. He leaned closer and began to kiss your back. ‚ÄúYou were so good tonight.‚Äù He whispered and continued to kiss you. He slowly removed himself from you and watched the way his cum dripped out of your ass and down to your pussy.   ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful view.‚Äù He crossed his arms and smirked at his beautiful girlfriend who could only look over her shoulder and smile lazily. He walked over to his drawer and took out a towel then walked back to her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll prepare us a bath come here.‚Äù And with a swift motion you were back into his arms.   ‚ÄúI love you Bruce.‚Äù You yawned he smiled and placed a gentle kiss on your lips. ‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù  word count: 1267,2024-07-10 07:38:58 GMT

A room in a wing that in other times had more people residing there; but as time had passed and the previous Master and Madam had passed away that wing had slowly but surely been emptied until only one inhabited remained. The room in itself was no fancy thing; it was an old room with a bathroom a bath and a small parlour ‚Äìthe only room to possess such an anteroom in the whole building-. The room had always belonged to the butler and head of staff of the Wayne household as it does today and would probably be as long as the house was in use.  The bedroom was not especially large just enough to hold the bare necessary furniture; the bathroom was nothing but practical and efficient to clean; as for the small parlour it was the largest of the small apartment. Yet it remained small and simple; two high-backed cushioned chairs of a faded maroon colour ‚Äìit wouldn‚Äôt be long before having to be refurbished- a wooden table between them large enough to hold a lamp a small plate ‚Äìthat might sometimes hold cookies and some others small cakes- a teapot and two tea cups with their respective plates. They all were facing towards a medium fireplace with an immaculate clean mantelpiece in which a set of pictures rest ‚Äìmost of them holding children sulking ones glaring ones smiling ones sleepy ones confused ones-. Hanging above the mantelpiece there‚Äôs a reproduction of The Evening Angel.  To each side of the fireplace there are paneled windows that by the late afternoon fill the small room with warm orange light in summer and autumn. A little bit to the left there‚Äôs a wooden door with a small window in its middle that leads to the orchard part of the gardens. On the right wall of the fireplace there are two bookcases full of books. On the left wall there‚Äôs the door of the bedroom and to its side a table that at its top there‚Äôs an electric kettle and several tin metal boxes and flasks filled with tea and aromatic herbs inside it behind two glass doors a set of teacups and teapots ‚Äìsome white some with delicate patterns some chipped ones-. Behind the high back chairs there is another bookcase ‚Äìthis one holds a Winchester Model 12 a Danish Butter Cookies tin can filled with sewing materials and some other mysterious baskets and boxes- and the door that leads to the inner narrow corridor of the service wing not too far down from this door there‚Äôs the door that leads to the kitchen and the service staircases that lead directly to the upper floors with the main bedrooms.  In this small room and humble room many have found refuge and comfort throughout the last years;  The brooding child who became a brooding man. He sits in silence while watching the fire ‚Äìwhen it‚Äôs lighted- or at The Evening Angel and drinks black tea.  The angry child who became a smiling man. He sits while chatting and laughing sometimes at others he resembles a certain silent brooding man. He drinks his tea with sugar and milk.  The lost child who became a broken man. He sits quietly while reading a book and answers the questions in his own time. He drinks whatever he is given which usually is calming and herbal.  The clever child who became a tired man. He sits talking quietly sometimes about meaningful things or sometimes about the last development in a case. He drinks sip after sip from soft green tea.  The silent child who became a wise woman. She doesn‚Äôt sit very long preparing the tea meticulously and in different manners according to their nature is how she spends her time. She loves pu-erh tea.  The violent child who became a caring man. He sits and draws in his sketchbook atop his crossed knee. Jazmine tea is his predilection and he refuses to take any other kind but he never refuses the sweetmeats.   When the tea is finished the empty cups stand forgotten with some leaves and darkened water on their bottom some crumbs remain on an empty plate and the two chairs eventually grow cold awaiting to be warmed again.,2024-07-10 05:34:41 GMT

He had four bullets left in the gun today as he no longer kept it fully loaded. He missed one while aiming at Black Mask and used the other two on his goons. Only one bullet remained. He knew it had to be used for something special. Jason swallowed trying to steady his hiccuping voice and control his trembling. ‚ÄúI can fix this for you.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù Bruce asked approaching Jason. Dick momentarily removed his hand from his face and looked up at Jason. Tim moved Damian behind him and watched the pair sure of where the conversation was heading. Jason placing his hand behind his back indicated he was going to shoot someone. But it didn‚Äôt happen that way.  Jason instantly turned the gun on himself pointing it to the side of his head. No one expected this.

A small smile appeared on your lips. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so amused.‚Äù He bit his tongue and watched you go on your knees and unbuckle his pants. He helped along by removing his gear and placing it next to his mask.   You took off his blue boxers and smiled seeing the way his cock had sprung up hard with precum practically spilling out. You licked the precum off from his tip and kissed his tip. He let out a soft groan and watched the way your hand slowly reached over towards his cock and stroke his veiny rough cock.  ‚ÄúTake off your shorts now.

You had brought him closer. ‚ÄúBut Bruce!‚Äù You whined and he quickly shut you up with the best way he knew how kissing you. He slid his tongue and quickly explored.   You moaned into his mouth as both of your salivas trickled down from the corner of your lips. He had reached over behind you head and grabbed a fist full of hair and pulled you away. ‚ÄúMy bitch.‚Äù   Suddenly he slammed his hips into your tight pussy you jerked up and let out a sudden scream of pleasure. ‚ÄòPoor Alfred and Damian‚Äô you thought.

This allowed him to make eye contact with you making you feel so small and pathetic in his embrace.  ‚ÄúFuck. You just enjoy the way my cock fits in you huh? My pussy. Mine.‚Äù He growled out. You two were a sweaty mess the way your hair began sticking to your forehead and your fingers began to dig your nails into his suit. Your moans echoed throughout the room as tears fell down your cheeks. A true pathetic slut. Exactly how Bruce wanted you to be.   He eventually got tired of this position and threw you onto the mattress. You spread your legs wide open and reached down to your wet pussy and spread the wetness across fingering yourself a bit and slipping in two fingers.   ‚ÄúNeed you now.‚Äù You cried and sniffled. He chuckled at the sight and walked over to you. He took off his suit and threw it in the corner of the room and centered his hips towards your wet pussy.   ‚ÄúTo believe that simple cock warming got you this wet.‚Äù He chuckled and slid himself into you so slowly it felt so delicious feeling the way you could just feel him balls deep inside of you. He gently fucked you at first lifting up your shirt and cupping your breast and flicking your nipples gently. He admired the way your dried up tears and slut face look had an effect on him.   He could feel it. You could feel it. The way his cock twitched inside your pussy. ‚ÄúFaster please!‚Äù You begged him. He wasted no time in fingering and flicking your clit and leaned down to kiss you. He pounded you and with his other free hand threw your leg over his shoulder. He broke off the kiss and looked into your eyes. ‚ÄúCum.‚Äù He simply said granting you the permission you so badly wanted. You too could feel the coil about to burst.   The way your walls clenched around his cock tighter and tighter. You both were a moaning and groaning mess. Heavy breathing and moans were only heard in the sex smelling room. Your legs began to shake slightly feeling your orgasm approaching slowly. You could practically feel your heart pounding in your head your body was heating up and you were thrusting yourself into him.   ‚ÄúNeed..to‚Ä¶cum!‚Äù You cried out and Bruce fingered you faster. He knew you were about to reach your climax and he was too. However he wanted you to cum first you first before anything. Your toes curled and you arched your back in pleasure when finally you felt the coil finally snap. Your orgasm had hit you in a way you‚Äôve never felt before in the three years you had been with Bruce.   ‚ÄúShit! Bruce I‚Äôm coming!‚Äù You sobbed and wrapped your arms around his shoulders and hugged him close. He had paused and let you cum around his cock. You shook violently under his body as he held you close and kissed your forehead. ‚ÄúBreathe my love‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered into your ear as you finally reached you high and began to calm down.  Your chest rose up and down and Bruce lifted himself up. He still needed to finish. He removed himself from you and flipped you around. ‚ÄúBruce?!‚Äù You exclaimed ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sensitive!‚Äù  He smiled and instantly inserted himself into your tight asshole. He groaned and pounded himself into you. You cried and moaned feeling so sensitive and good. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to cum!‚Äù He groaned and you could only smile happily. He groped and slapped your ass until his hands marked your pretty ass.  ‚ÄúFill me up please!‚Äù You sobbed out that was his breaking point. His cock twitched and with one final slam he filled you up with his cum deep inside your tight asshole. You hummed happily knowing that you two were finished. He leaned closer and began to kiss your back. ‚ÄúYou were so good tonight.‚Äù He whispered and continued to kiss you. He slowly removed himself from you and watched the way his cum dripped out of your ass and down to your pussy.   ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful view.‚Äù He crossed his arms and smirked at his beautiful girlfriend who could only look over her shoulder and smile lazily. He walked over to his drawer and took out a towel then walked back to her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll prepare us a bath come here.‚Äù And with a swift motion you were back into his arms.   ‚ÄúI love you Bruce.‚Äù You yawned he smiled and placed a gentle kiss on your lips. ‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù  word count: 1267,2024-07-10 07:38:58 GMT

Your moans echoed throughout the room as tears fell down your cheeks. A true pathetic slut. Exactly how Bruce wanted you to be.   He eventually got tired of this position and threw you onto the mattress. You spread your legs wide open and reached down to your wet pussy and spread the wetness across fingering yourself a bit and slipping in two fingers.   ‚ÄúNeed you now.‚Äù You cried and sniffled. He chuckled at the sight and walked over to you. He took off his suit and threw it in the corner of the room and centered his hips towards your wet pussy.   ‚ÄúTo believe that simple cock warming got you this wet.‚Äù He chuckled and slid himself into you so slowly it felt so delicious feeling the way you could just feel him balls deep inside of you. He gently fucked you at first lifting up your shirt and cupping your breast and flicking your nipples gently. He admired the way your dried up tears and slut face look had an effect on him.   He could feel it. You could feel it. The way his cock twitched inside your pussy. ‚ÄúFaster please!‚Äù You begged him. He wasted no time in fingering and flicking your clit and leaned down to kiss you. He pounded you and with his other free hand threw your leg over his shoulder. He broke off the kiss and looked into your eyes. ‚ÄúCum.‚Äù He simply said granting you the permission you so badly wanted. You too could feel the coil about to burst.   The way your walls clenched around his cock tighter and tighter. You both were a moaning and groaning mess. Heavy breathing and moans were only heard in the sex smelling room. Your legs began to shake slightly feeling your orgasm approaching slowly. You could practically feel your heart pounding in your head your body was heating up and you were thrusting yourself into him.   ‚ÄúNeed..to‚Ä¶cum!‚Äù You cried out and Bruce fingered you faster. He knew you were about to reach your climax and he was too. However he wanted you to cum first you first before anything. Your toes curled and you arched your back in pleasure when finally you felt the coil finally snap. Your orgasm had hit you in a way you‚Äôve never felt before in the three years you had been with Bruce.   ‚ÄúShit!

You shook violently under his body as he held you close and kissed your forehead. ‚ÄúBreathe my love‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered into your ear as you finally reached you high and began to calm down.  Your chest rose up and down and Bruce lifted himself up. He still needed to finish. He removed himself from you and flipped you around. ‚ÄúBruce?!‚Äù You exclaimed ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sensitive!‚Äù  He smiled and instantly inserted himself into your tight asshole. He groaned and pounded himself into you. You cried and moaned feeling so sensitive and good. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to cum!‚Äù He groaned and you could only smile happily. He groped and slapped your ass until his hands marked your pretty ass.  ‚ÄúFill me up please!‚Äù You sobbed out that was his breaking point. His cock twitched and with one final slam he filled you up with his cum deep inside your tight asshole. You hummed happily knowing that you two were finished. He leaned closer and began to kiss your back. ‚ÄúYou were so good tonight.‚Äù He whispered and continued to kiss you. He slowly removed himself from you and watched the way his cum dripped out of your ass and down to your pussy.   ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful view.‚Äù He crossed his arms and smirked at his beautiful girlfriend who could only look over her shoulder and smile lazily. He walked over to his drawer and took out a towel then walked back to her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll prepare us a bath come here.‚Äù And with a swift motion you were back into his arms.   ‚ÄúI love you Bruce.‚Äù You yawned he smiled and placed a gentle kiss on your lips. ‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù  word count: 1267,2024-07-10 07:38:58 GMT

Cock warming is definitely Bruce‚Äôs thing. He‚Äôd hold your hips down firmly to prevent you from squirming around. But how couldn‚Äôt you squirm around him? He fit perfectly inside you and you needed to move around to feel the way his veiny hard cock was inside of you. Tip practically touching your womb.      ‚ÄúStay still.‚Äù Bruce groaned while you practically sobbed for permission to start bouncing up and down his cock.   He had just left a battle with Harley Quinn. She could be a real bitch with that whiny squeaky toy like voice. Initially he had caught her doing the most common crime ever robbing a bank. He wrapped it up pretty quickly in under ten minutes or less but he was growing frustrated. He could only think of one thing on his mind and that was burying his cock deep into her walls. He wasted no time in quickly ending his patrol and speeding away through the night back to Wayne manor.   ‚ÄúBruce?‚Äù You had called out to him noticing a dark figure standing at your door way. You rubbed you eyes as you had slowly awoke from your slumber. He could only melt at the way your voice had called out to him. He shut the door behind him and walked over to you. He turned on the lamp light by your bedside drawer and watched you sit up. ‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù You had asked ‚ÄúIt always is.‚Äù Was the response.   You stood up from the bed and tiptoed to take off his mask. You threw it into your bed and caressed his face. ‚ÄúHow can I help?‚Äù You asked desperately feeling bad for Bruce. You always did taking care of the city was difficult enough. He walked over and sat down on the soft mattress. ‚ÄúHelp me darling.‚Äù He groaned softly as he pointed to his troublesome bulge poking out of his suit. A small smile appeared on your lips. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so amused.‚Äù He bit his tongue and watched you go on your knees and unbuckle his pants. He helped along by removing his gear and placing it next to his mask.   You took off his blue boxers and smiled seeing the way his cock had sprung up hard with precum practically spilling out. You licked the precum off from his tip and kissed his tip. He let out a soft groan and watched the way your hand slowly reached over towards his cock and stroke his veiny rough cock.  ‚ÄúTake off your shorts now. On top of me.‚Äù He commanded and you did exactly that before your warm mouth could start bobbing up and down on his dick. As much as he wanted that and paint your pretty face with his cum he wanted to bury his dick into your tight pussy way more.  As soon as you centered yourself on top of Bruce‚Äôs cock he firmly grabbed your hips and slid you down slowly into him before you could. Your moans were like music to his ears and he moaned along with you. Eventually you began to bounce but Bruce held you tightly down.   ‚ÄúNo. Tonight‚Äôs going to be me being inside this tight pussy. I‚Äôll move when I want to.‚Äù You could feel the prick of tears form and wrapped your arms around his shoulders. You had brought him closer. ‚ÄúBut Bruce!‚Äù You whined and he quickly shut you up with the best way he knew how kissing you. He slid his tongue and quickly explored.   You moaned into his mouth as both of your salivas trickled down from the corner of your lips. He had reached over behind you head and grabbed a fist full of hair and pulled you away. ‚ÄúMy bitch.‚Äù   Suddenly he slammed his hips into your tight pussy you jerked up and let out a sudden scream of pleasure. ‚ÄòPoor Alfred and Damian‚Äô you thought. Your heavy breathing and moans mixed along with his as he grabbed your ass firmly and stood up. This allowed him to make eye contact with you making you feel so small and pathetic in his embrace.  ‚ÄúFuck. You just enjoy the way my cock fits in you huh? My pussy. Mine.‚Äù He growled out.

Pyrope took a seat from across Zebra Jasper as Ametrine just stood standing next to Pyrope and Zebra Jasper.  Before Zebra Jasper could ask about what Pyrope reported Ametrine jumped in before him.  ‚ÄúWhere were you?! You‚Äôre late!‚Äù Ametrine yelled quite irritated and angry. Pyrope ‚Äúlooked‚Äù at Ametrine.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you too Ametrine.‚Äù Pyrope said calm and composed with his stoic but authoritarian tone evident.  ‚ÄúYeah yeah it‚Äôs good to see you too Py.‚Äù Ametrine stated even going further to blush a dark purple. Upon seeing this Zebra Jasper chuckled but then he composed himself and looked at Pyrope.   ‚ÄúNow Pyrope you said that you had good news and bad news. May I ask what they are?‚Äù Zebra Jasper asked while looking between Ametrine and Pyrope.  ‚ÄúYeah what are they?!‚Äù Ametrine inquired a bit too forcefully.  ‚ÄúWell it depends. Do you want to hear the good news or the bad news first?‚Äù Pyrope asked back at them.   Zebra Jasper and Ametrine thought for a bit until they‚Äôve finally decided.  ‚ÄúThe bad news!‚Äù Ametrine responded a bit too enthusiastically.   ‚ÄúWell then‚Ä¶‚Äù Pyrope started while placing his cane next to the table making it lean against the table. ‚ÄúA familiar animatronic jester of our kind explained how he witnessed a certain monstrous gemstone return. A certain second high ranked gemstone. Does it ring any bells Zebra Jasper?‚Äù  Zebra Jasper nodded as Ametrine looked in puzzlement at Zebra Jasper.  ‚ÄúSo you say that Sardonyx witnessed Bixbyite return after all these 40054 centuries?‚Äù Zebra Jasper asked.  ‚ÄúIndeed and how I know Sardonyx he wouldn‚Äôt lie about something like this.‚Äù Pyrope confirmed.  ‚ÄúWho is this Bixbyite?‚Äù Ametrine asked out of nowhere but still curious about who this ‚ÄòBixbyite‚Äô is.  ‚ÄúWell you see my dear. Bixbyite is everything that is not just and kind in this world. He‚Äôs the monster that‚Äôs under your bed. He‚Äôs your sleep paralysis demon and he‚Äôs the Devil himself. He could be anything and everything that you fear. He‚Äôs also a second high ranked gemstone an Elite just like me and the others but he‚Äôs‚Ä¶troubling even dangerous as well.‚Äù Zebra Jasper explained to Ametrine about Bixbyite.  ‚ÄúBut what‚Äôs with the whole panic? Doesn‚Äôt he sound like Mystic Topaz or Quantum Quattro Silica?‚Äù Ametrine asked.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs unlike Mystic Topaz and Quantum Quattro Silica. Bixbyite has no problem in shattering other gemstones to get what he wants while Mystic Topaz only scares human kind and as for Quantum Quattro Silica as much as I dislike him only wants my power and to dethrone me but that‚Äôs never going to happen.‚Äù Zebra Jasper further explained.  ‚ÄúAnd where Bixbyite goes his creations follow.‚Äù Pyrope added.  Zebra Jasper nodded. ‚ÄúIndeed. I feel sympathetic for them all for having a creator like Bixbyite. It must be scary for them all.‚Äù   ‚ÄúSo why now? Why did Bixbyite return?‚Äù Ametrine asked.  ‚ÄúUnsure but I know that he‚Äôs got a plan up his sleeve or rather tongue.‚Äù Zebra Jasper chuckled at the last bit.  ‚ÄúIndeed. We must keep our eyes on him.‚Äù Pyrope added.  ‚ÄúQuite so. I‚Äôll update my creations to keep a look out on Bixbyite‚Äôs creations.‚Äù Zebra Jasper agreed and added.  Ametrine turned to look at Pyrope. ‚ÄúWhat about the good news?‚Äù  ‚ÄúRight. I got invited to Mr. Bruce Wayne‚Äôs charity event a gala tonight along with a colleague of mine Mr. Kevin Smith.‚Äù Pyrope answered to Ametrine‚Äôs question.  Ametrine gave a low growl. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it when you use the word &#x27;colleague‚Äô. It sounds too much like &#x27;partner‚Äô and &#x27;boyfriend‚Äô.‚Äù Ametrine mumbled under his breath.  Zebra Jasper chuckled. ‚ÄúAw is someone perhaps jealous?‚Äù Zebra Jasper asked jokingly.  Pyrope kept a straight face on. ‚ÄúDo not worry Am. He‚Äôs not going to be my date or anything like that.‚Äù  Ametrine looked relieved but still on edge.  ‚ÄúI shall go to Mr. Wayne‚Äôs charity gala whereas you two shall get the second plan in motion understood?‚Äù Pyrope clarified.  Both Ametrine and Zebra Jasper nodded their heads.  ‚ÄúGood. I should get going and get ready for the event. Farewell the both of you.‚Äù Pyrope said as he got up and exited Zebra Jasper‚Äôs hideout.  Zebra Jasper looked at Ametrine as Pyrope was fully out of sight.   ‚ÄúWell now that was a successfully meeting as I do so say myself.‚Äù  Ametrine nodded. ‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù  He then looked outside the window seeing that it was a full Moon tonight. ‚ÄúDo you ever think that Moonstone will return?‚Äù Ametrine asked.  Zebra Jasper looked at the full Moon as well. ‚ÄúUnsure but the good thing is she‚Äôll always look down on us.‚Äù Zebra Jasper replied a bit solemnly.   ‚ÄúTrue.‚Äù Ametrine agreed. ‚ÄúAnyway I have to get going as well.‚Äù   Ametrine turned and started to walk but before he could fully exit and leave Zebra Jasper spoke up behind him.   ‚ÄúFarewell Am and don‚Äôt go after Two-Face understood?‚Äù Zebra Jasper said a bit forceful at the latter bit.  Ametrine smirked.  ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt but my sadistic side will.‚Äù Ametrine finally replied as he exited Zebra Jasper‚Äôs hideout and walked off down the streets of Gotham City with one last glance at the full Moon and a last thought about Moonstone.,2024-07-10 11:45:11 GMT

Cock warming is definitely Bruce‚Äôs thing. He‚Äôd hold your hips down firmly to prevent you from squirming around. But how couldn‚Äôt you squirm around him? He fit perfectly inside you and you needed to move around to feel the way his veiny hard cock was inside of you. Tip practically touching your womb.      ‚ÄúStay still.‚Äù Bruce groaned while you practically sobbed for permission to start bouncing up and down his cock.   He had just left a battle with Harley Quinn. She could be a real bitch with that whiny squeaky toy like voice. Initially he had caught her doing the most common crime ever robbing a bank. He wrapped it up pretty quickly in under ten minutes or less but he was growing frustrated. He could only think of one thing on his mind and that was burying his cock deep into her walls. He wasted no time in quickly ending his patrol and speeding away through the night back to Wayne manor.   ‚ÄúBruce?‚Äù You had called out to him noticing a dark figure standing at your door way. You rubbed you eyes as you had slowly awoke from your slumber. He could only melt at the way your voice had called out to him. He shut the door behind him and walked over to you. He turned on the lamp light by your bedside drawer and watched you sit up. ‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù You had asked ‚ÄúIt always is.‚Äù Was the response.   You stood up from the bed and tiptoed to take off his mask. You threw it into your bed and caressed his face. ‚ÄúHow can I help?‚Äù You asked desperately feeling bad for Bruce. You always did taking care of the city was difficult enough. He walked over and sat down on the soft mattress. ‚ÄúHelp me darling.‚Äù He groaned softly as he pointed to his troublesome bulge poking out of his suit. A small smile appeared on your lips. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so amused.‚Äù He bit his tongue and watched you go on your knees and unbuckle his pants. He helped along by removing his gear and placing it next to his mask.   You took off his blue boxers and smiled seeing the way his cock had sprung up hard with precum practically spilling out. You licked the precum off from his tip and kissed his tip. He let out a soft groan and watched the way your hand slowly reached over towards his cock and stroke his veiny rough cock.  ‚ÄúTake off your shorts now. On top of me.‚Äù He commanded and you did exactly that before your warm mouth could start bobbing up and down on his dick. As much as he wanted that and paint your pretty face with his cum he wanted to bury his dick into your tight pussy way more.  As soon as you centered yourself on top of Bruce‚Äôs cock he firmly grabbed your hips and slid you down slowly into him before you could. Your moans were like music to his ears and he moaned along with you. Eventually you began to bounce but Bruce held you tightly down.   ‚ÄúNo. Tonight‚Äôs going to be me being inside this tight pussy. I‚Äôll move when I want to.‚Äù You could feel the prick of tears form and wrapped your arms around his shoulders. You had brought him closer. ‚ÄúBut Bruce!‚Äù You whined and he quickly shut you up with the best way he knew how kissing you. He slid his tongue and quickly explored.   You moaned into his mouth as both of your salivas trickled down from the corner of your lips. He had reached over behind you head and grabbed a fist full of hair and pulled you away. ‚ÄúMy bitch.‚Äù   Suddenly he slammed his hips into your tight pussy you jerked up and let out a sudden scream of pleasure. ‚ÄòPoor Alfred and Damian‚Äô you thought. Your heavy breathing and moans mixed along with his as he grabbed your ass firmly and stood up. This allowed him to make eye contact with you making you feel so small and pathetic in his embrace.  ‚ÄúFuck. You just enjoy the way my cock fits in you huh? My pussy. Mine.‚Äù He growled out. You two were a sweaty mess the way your hair began sticking to your forehead and your fingers began to dig your nails into his suit. Your moans echoed throughout the room as tears fell down your cheeks. A true pathetic slut. Exactly how Bruce wanted you to be.   He eventually got tired of this position and threw you onto the mattress. You spread your legs wide open and reached down to your wet pussy and spread the wetness across fingering yourself a bit and slipping in two fingers.   ‚ÄúNeed you now.‚Äù You cried and sniffled. He chuckled at the sight and walked over to you. He took off his suit and threw it in the corner of the room and centered his hips towards your wet pussy.   ‚ÄúTo believe that simple cock warming got you this wet.‚Äù He chuckled and slid himself into you so slowly it felt so delicious feeling the way you could just feel him balls deep inside of you. He gently fucked you at first lifting up your shirt and cupping your breast and flicking your nipples gently. He admired the way your dried up tears and slut face look had an effect on him.   He could feel it. You could feel it. The way his cock twitched inside your pussy. ‚ÄúFaster please!‚Äù You begged him. He wasted no time in fingering and flicking your clit and leaned down to kiss you. He pounded you and with his other free hand threw your leg over his shoulder. He broke off the kiss and looked into your eyes. ‚ÄúCum.‚Äù He simply said granting you the permission you so badly wanted. You too could feel the coil about to burst.   The way your walls clenched around his cock tighter and tighter. You both were a moaning and groaning mess. Heavy breathing and moans were only heard in the sex smelling room. Your legs began to shake slightly feeling your orgasm approaching slowly. You could practically feel your heart pounding in your head your body was heating up and you were thrusting yourself into him.   ‚ÄúNeed..to‚Ä¶cum!‚Äù You cried out and Bruce fingered you faster. He knew you were about to reach your climax and he was too. However he wanted you to cum first you first before anything. Your toes curled and you arched your back in pleasure when finally you felt the coil finally snap. Your orgasm had hit you in a way you‚Äôve never felt before in the three years you had been with Bruce.   ‚ÄúShit! Bruce I‚Äôm coming!‚Äù You sobbed and wrapped your arms around his shoulders and hugged him close. He had paused and let you cum around his cock. You shook violently under his body as he held you close and kissed your forehead. ‚ÄúBreathe my love‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered into your ear as you finally reached you high and began to calm down.  Your chest rose up and down and Bruce lifted himself up. He still needed to finish. He removed himself from you and flipped you around. ‚ÄúBruce?!‚Äù You exclaimed ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sensitive!‚Äù  He smiled and instantly inserted himself into your tight asshole. He groaned and pounded himself into you. You cried and moaned feeling so sensitive and good. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to cum!‚Äù He groaned and you could only smile happily. He groped and slapped your ass until his hands marked your pretty ass.  ‚ÄúFill me up please!‚Äù You sobbed out that was his breaking point. His cock twitched and with one final slam he filled you up with his cum deep inside your tight asshole. You hummed happily knowing that you two were finished. He leaned closer and began to kiss your back. ‚ÄúYou were so good tonight.‚Äù He whispered and continued to kiss you. He slowly removed himself from you and watched the way his cum dripped out of your ass and down to your pussy.   ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful view.‚Äù He crossed his arms and smirked at his beautiful girlfriend who could only look over her shoulder and smile lazily. He walked over to his drawer and took out a towel then walked back to her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll prepare us a bath come here.‚Äù And with a swift motion you were back into his arms.   ‚ÄúI love you Bruce.‚Äù You yawned he smiled and placed a gentle kiss on your lips. ‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù  word count: 1267,2024-07-10 07:38:58 GMT

Pyrope took a seat from across Zebra Jasper as Ametrine just stood standing next to Pyrope and Zebra Jasper.  Before Zebra Jasper could ask about what Pyrope reported Ametrine jumped in before him.  ‚ÄúWhere were you?! You‚Äôre late!‚Äù Ametrine yelled quite irritated and angry. Pyrope ‚Äúlooked‚Äù at Ametrine.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you too Ametrine.‚Äù Pyrope said calm and composed with his stoic but authoritarian tone evident.  ‚ÄúYeah yeah it‚Äôs good to see you too Py.‚Äù Ametrine stated even going further to blush a dark purple. Upon seeing this Zebra Jasper chuckled but then he composed himself and looked at Pyrope.   ‚ÄúNow Pyrope you said that you had good news and bad news. May I ask what they are?‚Äù Zebra Jasper asked while looking between Ametrine and Pyrope.  ‚ÄúYeah what are they?!‚Äù Ametrine inquired a bit too forcefully.  ‚ÄúWell it depends. Do you want to hear the good news or the bad news first?‚Äù Pyrope asked back at them.   Zebra Jasper and Ametrine thought for a bit until they‚Äôve finally decided.  ‚ÄúThe bad news!‚Äù Ametrine responded a bit too enthusiastically.   ‚ÄúWell then‚Ä¶‚Äù Pyrope started while placing his cane next to the table making it lean against the table. ‚ÄúA familiar animatronic jester of our kind explained how he witnessed a certain monstrous gemstone return. A certain second high ranked gemstone. Does it ring any bells Zebra Jasper?‚Äù  Zebra Jasper nodded as Ametrine looked in puzzlement at Zebra Jasper.  ‚ÄúSo you say that Sardonyx witnessed Bixbyite return after all these 40054 centuries?‚Äù Zebra Jasper asked.  ‚ÄúIndeed and how I know Sardonyx he wouldn‚Äôt lie about something like this.‚Äù Pyrope confirmed.  ‚ÄúWho is this Bixbyite?‚Äù Ametrine asked out of nowhere but still curious about who this ‚ÄòBixbyite‚Äô is.  ‚ÄúWell you see my dear. Bixbyite is everything that is not just and kind in this world. He‚Äôs the monster that‚Äôs under your bed. He‚Äôs your sleep paralysis demon and he‚Äôs the Devil himself. He could be anything and everything that you fear. He‚Äôs also a second high ranked gemstone an Elite just like me and the others but he‚Äôs‚Ä¶troubling even dangerous as well.‚Äù Zebra Jasper explained to Ametrine about Bixbyite.  ‚ÄúBut what‚Äôs with the whole panic? Doesn‚Äôt he sound like Mystic Topaz or Quantum Quattro Silica?‚Äù Ametrine asked.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs unlike Mystic Topaz and Quantum Quattro Silica. Bixbyite has no problem in shattering other gemstones to get what he wants while Mystic Topaz only scares human kind and as for Quantum Quattro Silica as much as I dislike him only wants my power and to dethrone me but that‚Äôs never going to happen.‚Äù Zebra Jasper further explained.  ‚ÄúAnd where Bixbyite goes his creations follow.‚Äù Pyrope added.  Zebra Jasper nodded. ‚ÄúIndeed. I feel sympathetic for them all for having a creator like Bixbyite. It must be scary for them all.‚Äù   ‚ÄúSo why now? Why did Bixbyite return?‚Äù Ametrine asked.  ‚ÄúUnsure but I know that he‚Äôs got a plan up his sleeve or rather tongue.‚Äù Zebra Jasper chuckled at the last bit.  ‚ÄúIndeed. We must keep our eyes on him.‚Äù Pyrope added.  ‚ÄúQuite so. I‚Äôll update my creations to keep a look out on Bixbyite‚Äôs creations.‚Äù Zebra Jasper agreed and added.  Ametrine turned to look at Pyrope. ‚ÄúWhat about the good news?‚Äù  ‚ÄúRight. I got invited to Mr. Bruce Wayne‚Äôs charity event a gala tonight along with a colleague of mine Mr. Kevin Smith.‚Äù Pyrope answered to Ametrine‚Äôs question.  Ametrine gave a low growl. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it when you use the word &#x27;colleague‚Äô. It sounds too much like &#x27;partner‚Äô and &#x27;boyfriend‚Äô.‚Äù Ametrine mumbled under his breath.  Zebra Jasper chuckled. ‚ÄúAw is someone perhaps jealous?‚Äù Zebra Jasper asked jokingly.  Pyrope kept a straight face on. ‚ÄúDo not worry Am. He‚Äôs not going to be my date or anything like that.‚Äù  Ametrine looked relieved but still on edge.  ‚ÄúI shall go to Mr. Wayne‚Äôs charity gala whereas you two shall get the second plan in motion understood?‚Äù Pyrope clarified.  Both Ametrine and Zebra Jasper nodded their heads.  ‚ÄúGood. I should get going and get ready for the event. Farewell the both of you.‚Äù Pyrope said as he got up and exited Zebra Jasper‚Äôs hideout.  Zebra Jasper looked at Ametrine as Pyrope was fully out of sight.   ‚ÄúWell now that was a successfully meeting as I do so say myself.‚Äù  Ametrine nodded. ‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù  He then looked outside the window seeing that it was a full Moon tonight. ‚ÄúDo you ever think that Moonstone will return?‚Äù Ametrine asked.  Zebra Jasper looked at the full Moon as well. ‚ÄúUnsure but the good thing is she‚Äôll always look down on us.‚Äù Zebra Jasper replied a bit solemnly.   ‚ÄúTrue.‚Äù Ametrine agreed. ‚ÄúAnyway I have to get going as well.‚Äù   Ametrine turned and started to walk but before he could fully exit and leave Zebra Jasper spoke up behind him.   ‚ÄúFarewell Am and don‚Äôt go after Two-Face understood?‚Äù Zebra Jasper said a bit forceful at the latter bit.  Ametrine smirked.  ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt but my sadistic side will.‚Äù Ametrine finally replied as he exited Zebra Jasper‚Äôs hideout and walked off down the streets of Gotham City with one last glance at the full Moon and a last thought about Moonstone.,2024-07-10 11:45:11 GMT

It was subtle hidden in the glint in his eyes and the flex of his hands. No one suspects it so no one sees it.   Timothy Drake was brutal in a way that his brothers were not. His way wasn‚Äôt the electric edge of Nightwing the explosive domineering threat of Red Hood or even the artistic violence that the newest Robin employed indiscriminately. No Red Robin was surgical and precise.  Even the team he led grew to be known for their draconian tactics. They were a sign of hope to those in need but for those that ended up in their line of fire‚Ä¶ Timothy Drake was raised to lead and he was damn good at it.  You wouldn‚Äôt expect it looking at the young man slumped over a keyboard cradling a cup of coffee like it was his last hope but there was something other to Timothy Drake.   This was the man who had been nearly killed by his childhood hero and now shared a breakfast table with him. This was the man who had an organ ripped from his body by a man playing at being a demon. This was the man who lost everything over and over and rebuilt himself anew.   Timothy Drake fought and earned his name as Robin. He was the first to sacrifice the first to jump into the line of fire he was a hero. But in another life he ruled the world with an iron fist and a team that would do whatever it took to keep him in power. The only difference in this life is his lack of desire for a throne.   You wouldn‚Äôt expect it watching Timothy Drake carry food and supplies to an encampment of homeless children but if you looked at the dried blood on his bo staff‚Ä¶.   Timothy Drake was raised to be cut-throat if only Janet Drake knew how literally he would take it.,2024-07-10 16:51:44 GMT

Bruce Wayne is a master thief and self-made socialite. But this is not a basic one-to-one swap! I have tried very hard to do every character justice while adapting the parts of comics canon I accept (basically the post-Crisis/pre-Flashpoint universe plus Duke) which is why it‚Äôs ridiculously detailed. There are 60 PAGES.  Featuring:   Selina and Maggie Kyle Leslie Thompkins Holly Robinson Barbara Gordon Helena Bertinelli Stephanie Brown Cassandra Cain and Kitrina Falcone being main characters.  Characters who age consistently despite how little comics continuity wants to conform to the real progression time. I will make it make sense - Characters who are allowed to be happy and romantically committed and have meaningful development addressing their flaws and traumas in coherent narrative arcs. Their growth is not always linear but never just undone. The Cats make healthier choices than the canon Bats make at times like going to therapy due to their different contexts and relationships so there‚Äôs overall less angst and self-destructiveness. But they‚Äôre still incredibly traumatised and frequently messy about it. Female characters who are written with respect complex interiority and agency.  Deep nuanced relationships foil dynamics (familial platonic and romantic) and vigilante philosophy.  New costume designs and codenames.  Emotional support cats for everyone with a Greek mythology naming theme. Maggie doing cool important stuff as a civilian and not being fridged and stuck in a mental hospital for years.  Holly being a superhero. Babs becoming Oracle and staying that way.  Villains dying or reforming and staying that way. More of Holly and Karon being a lesbian couple. And Brucelina Dickbabs Timsteph Timbern and Harlivy.  Harvey Dent Two-Face and Talia al Ghul being sympathetic three-dimensional antivillains/antiheroes with genuine love for people. And more!

It was subtle hidden in the glint in his eyes and the flex of his hands. No one suspects it so no one sees it.   Timothy Drake was brutal in a way that his brothers were not. His way wasn‚Äôt the electric edge of Nightwing the explosive domineering threat of Red Hood or even the artistic violence that the newest Robin employed indiscriminately. No Red Robin was surgical and precise.  Even the team he led grew to be known for their draconian tactics. They were a sign of hope to those in need but for those that ended up in their line of fire‚Ä¶ Timothy Drake was raised to lead and he was damn good at it.  You wouldn‚Äôt expect it looking at the young man slumped over a keyboard cradling a cup of coffee like it was his last hope but there was something other to Timothy Drake.   This was the man who had been nearly killed by his childhood hero and now shared a breakfast table with him. This was the man who had an organ ripped from his body by a man playing at being a demon. This was the man who lost everything over and over and rebuilt himself anew.   Timothy Drake fought and earned his name as Robin. He was the first to sacrifice the first to jump into the line of fire he was a hero. But in another life he ruled the world with an iron fist and a team that would do whatever it took to keep him in power. The only difference in this life is his lack of desire for a throne.   You wouldn‚Äôt expect it watching Timothy Drake carry food and supplies to an encampment of homeless children but if you looked at the dried blood on his bo staff‚Ä¶.   Timothy Drake was raised to be cut-throat if only Janet Drake knew how literally he would take it.,2024-07-10 16:51:44 GMT

Bruce Wayne is a master thief and self-made socialite. But this is not a basic one-to-one swap! I have tried very hard to do every character justice while adapting the parts of comics canon I accept (basically the post-Crisis/pre-Flashpoint universe plus Duke) which is why it‚Äôs ridiculously detailed. There are 60 PAGES.  Featuring:   Selina and Maggie Kyle Leslie Thompkins Holly Robinson Barbara Gordon Helena Bertinelli Stephanie Brown Cassandra Cain and Kitrina Falcone being main characters.  Characters who age consistently despite how little comics continuity wants to conform to the real progression time. I will make it make sense - Characters who are allowed to be happy and romantically committed and have meaningful development addressing their flaws and traumas in coherent narrative arcs. Their growth is not always linear but never just undone. The Cats make healthier choices than the canon Bats make at times like going to therapy due to their different contexts and relationships so there‚Äôs overall less angst and self-destructiveness. But they‚Äôre still incredibly traumatised and frequently messy about it. Female characters who are written with respect complex interiority and agency.  Deep nuanced relationships foil dynamics (familial platonic and romantic) and vigilante philosophy.  New costume designs and codenames.  Emotional support cats for everyone with a Greek mythology naming theme. Maggie doing cool important stuff as a civilian and not being fridged and stuck in a mental hospital for years.  Holly being a superhero. Babs becoming Oracle and staying that way.  Villains dying or reforming and staying that way. More of Holly and Karon being a lesbian couple. And Brucelina Dickbabs Timsteph Timbern and Harlivy.  Harvey Dent Two-Face and Talia al Ghul being sympathetic three-dimensional antivillains/antiheroes with genuine love for people. And more!

I‚Äôm not gonna condemn him and I think the outburst he had earlier towards Jason might have been what pushed him to find outside help even if he says that ‚Äúit stays in the family‚Äù. Do I honestly think he would have put Jason on a mental institute? I really don‚Äôt think so especially with him keeping their alter ego under wraps when going over what happened to Jason and as I said his previous idea of keeping their problems within the family I‚Äôm thinking he was bringing in a psychologist to help Jason but from their home.   The narration is in the pov of the lady psychologist and the excerpts tell us that Jason does end up talking to her because of how we have Jason going over how he felt during his fight with scarecrow but also Bruce talks to her and also ends up telling her about their alter egos.   I think everything Bruce has done so far in this issue is out of love for Jason it sucks that he didn‚Äôt tell Jason about the psychologist but like it says Jason was pulling back more and more no matter what Bruce and Alfred did and I think Bruce didn‚Äôt know what else to do other than actually do the thing he said he didn‚Äôt want to do in the hopes of getting Jason help. Was it right? No. Is he trying? Yes because he cares so much but is still going to make mistakes. Jason‚Äôs trauma isn‚Äôt something that will just go away if they give him space and ignore it he went through something horrible and the family is scrambling to find their footing again and I‚Äôm excited to see what they do moving forwards because seeing Bruce actually love Jason and care is a big yippee to me.,2024-07-10 20:52:30 GMT

I‚Äôm not gonna condemn him and I think the outburst he had earlier towards Jason might have been what pushed him to find outside help even if he says that ‚Äúit stays in the family‚Äù. Do I honestly think he would have put Jason on a mental institute? I really don‚Äôt think so especially with him keeping their alter ego under wraps when going over what happened to Jason and as I said his previous idea of keeping their problems within the family I‚Äôm thinking he was bringing in a psychologist to help Jason but from their home.   The narration is in the pov of the lady psychologist and the excerpts tell us that Jason does end up talking to her because of how we have Jason going over how he felt during his fight with scarecrow but also Bruce talks to her and also ends up telling her about their alter egos.   I think everything Bruce has done so far in this issue is out of love for Jason it sucks that he didn‚Äôt tell Jason about the psychologist but like it says Jason was pulling back more and more no matter what Bruce and Alfred did and I think Bruce didn‚Äôt know what else to do other than actually do the thing he said he didn‚Äôt want to do in the hopes of getting Jason help. Was it right? No. Is he trying? Yes because he cares so much but is still going to make mistakes. Jason‚Äôs trauma isn‚Äôt something that will just go away if they give him space and ignore it he went through something horrible and the family is scrambling to find their footing again and I‚Äôm excited to see what they do moving forwards because seeing Bruce actually love Jason and care is a big yippee to me.,2024-07-10 20:52:30 GMT

The number of slides the length of the accompanying lecture and the grossness of the material has only grown larger since then. For Jason it was up to 215 slides and took over four hours to present.

Most of Jason fanon traits is based on his robin days. He‚Äôs been written as an anti hero and villain and has a lot of characterisation. His writing is inconsistent. So what‚Äôs wrong if people write him based on how they view him. It‚Äôs called fanon for a reason and expecting people to pick up your fav while you are hating Jason is ludicrous. The morale superiority some people have just because their fav is not well known or a woman is ridiculous.   I used to nod my head to this take because I felt like ‚Äúhey Jason is a guy and Helena/Mia are women whose stories been stolen‚Äù like I wanted to be politically correct and I thought this was right. But fuck this. Why do they get to have those traits only? Is it a crime if someone thinks it‚Äôs rationale for Jason‚Äôs character to take this trope. Fanon is meant to write wtv fuck u the want that isn‚Äôt in canon and half the time they aren‚Äôt far- fetched.   Jason has always looked out for women and children during his robin days and even as red hood sometimes. Sure it‚Äôs inconsistent but it‚Äôs without a doubt people do that simply because they know his character. He is from the crime alley and his mother was a drug addict. People hc him being an English teacher simply because he has shown to be interested in literature. He was from the streets so it isn‚Äôt far fetched and even implied in a comic (during Mia‚Äôs interaction in arrow) that he might have done child prostitution to get by. It‚Äôs fanon people are allowed to explore possibilities. How does him having such experiences invalidate your fav‚Äôs experiences? Is it wrong that such a strong and big guy had such experiences? Maybe people write that so they can cope with such experiences since they relate to him more. Are these experiences only for your favs? That‚Äôs ridiculous.  I don‚Äôt get why people are mad at a fanon characterisation that has its roots in comics. The guy hasn‚Äôt been written well at all and people in fanon write their take on him. One you have never read Jason as Robin or redhood. 2 you think you‚Äôre justified to hate Jason simply because ‚Äúpoor Helena Jason takes her place‚Äù.   Dc has so many characters and some characters are bound to be similar in some ways.   Helena is already an amazing character so why does hating Jason your way of promoting her? She doesn‚Äôt need to be compared tf. Some people just hate on Jason and read zero comics on her. Somehow people have made themselves believe Jason is the reason why Helena isn‚Äôt popular. Jason is popular because he‚Äôs a bad victim not a model one and people relate to that. A lot of people DO NOT WANT HIM to be Helena. They prefer him as a villain. I‚Äôm deadass done w anyone who tries to pretend he can‚Äôt have any of these traits. It‚Äôs not about the traits it‚Äôs about who and why they have it. So comparing gets you nowhere.   Lastly let‚Äôs be honest Jason fans don‚Äôt read any other comics or works besides Jason. So how would they copy a character they don‚Äôt know exist?,2024-07-11 00:50:23 GMT

83,Batman,['batjokes'  'bruce wayne'  'joker'  'jason todd'  'robin'  'robin lives'  'my jibber-jabber'],fractualized,Today in ‚ÄúI know we bust on comics a lot around here but there are still plenty of comics worth your time‚Äù I think Robin Lives is off to a promising start!  Also I have to say I found myself comparing it to Three Jokers. For one thing it seems like much more of an examination of trauma than Three Jokers was purported to be. For another while Three Jokers had me doubting that Geoff Johns really read The Killing Joke Robin Lives feels like JM DeMatteis gives a crap about what actually happened in ‚ÄúDeath in the Family.‚Äù  But my petty grudges aside here‚Äôs what I liked about Robin Lives #1 with lots of spoilers. (And images of child murder and such obviously.)  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Unless there are shenanigans later Joker definitely dies on the very first page.   ALT Falls at Bruce‚Äôs feet. Aw. :(  So this presents to us an instant mystery! Was Bruce responsible? Or was it Jason? Someone else entirely? Looks like the answer will be in three more issues. For now we flash back to the aftermath of Jason‚Äôs near-death.  DeMatteis deals with Joker‚Äôs infamous ambassadorship by simply‚Ä¶ taking it away. Which is pretty funny to me.  ALT ‚ÄúHonestly we were coming off a pretty wild party when we made that decision. Who knows what we were thinking? Hahaha no hard feelings right‚Äî What‚Äôs that gas??‚Äù  I should note the narration in the purple box which starts before this scene. Halfway through the issue we learn that this story is being narrated by Dr. Saraswati Dev (aka Sara) a trauma doctor that Bruce hires for Jason. As we read what happens in this deviation from canon she examines how we should view people who do such terrible things when their own lives and actions are affected by mental illness their own trauma and so on. It‚Äôs an admittedly blunt story-telling tactic spelling out the nuance for the reader but I don‚Äôt mind it and it tells us that this version of Jason‚Äôs story won‚Äôt end cleanly.  Sara also clearly knows much more about Batman and his sidekicks than the average civilian which raises the question of how she gets so involved in their lives. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs not because she becomes a love interest‚Ä¶ but then again if that‚Äôs presented as one of Bruce‚Äôs screwed up mistakes that has potential!  Anyway as reviewed in a previous post Joker was uneasy about killing Jason from the start and that doesn‚Äôt change in this version. When Bruce rescues the Iranian representatives Joker tries to downplay what he did.  ALT Hee hee ‚ÄúBatsy-boo.‚Äù  Joker can‚Äôt escape for long though.  ALT And I have to pause here to note that this scene is reminiscent of the climax in the ‚ÄúGoing Sane‚Äù storyline which DeMatteis also wrote.  ALTALT Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight #68  There are differences in the scenarios of course but the other thing about ‚ÄúGoing Sane‚Äù is that Joker/Joseph repeatedly refers to the urge to return to his former self as drowning.  ALT Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight #66  So in Robin Lives it adds an extra kick when Bruce overturns Joker‚Äôs boat and then stands by as Joker drowns.  Oh god that feeling when your secret fears come to fruition  But don‚Äôt worry!  ALT This is all an interesting variation ‚ÄúDeath in the Family.‚Äù Then in his grief Bruce was constantly fluctuating on if he was going to kill Joker and his eventual attempt was trapping Joker in a crashing helicopter. In Robin Lives he seems ambivalent too again engineering the circumstances for Joker to die but not being an entirely active participant and also not angry at Clark for rescuing him. (Speaking of which Clark sure as heck didn‚Äôt rescue Joker from the original helicopter incident. I guess he‚Äôs ambivalent in his own way!)  So Joker is returned to Arkham Asylum where Bruce talks to the current director Dr. Benjamin Stoner (who evidently really was the director at the time but also a literal agent of chaos??? OK I guess I‚Äôll keep that in mind). Stoner pushes back on Bruce‚Äôs assessment of the Joker.  ALT At the time Bruce vanishes but as we see in the narration when Bruce faildads hard with a recovering Jason he later seems to reflect on Stoner‚Äôs words along with Jason‚Äôs.  ALT The page already notes that no this chat is not going to be enough to get Jason back to baseline. But it‚Äôs also darkly hilarious that Dick thought it would be especially keeping in mind that the implication is that this is the only time Dick comes over and it‚Äôs after Jason has been listless for some time. It‚Äôs almost like this whole family is bad at feelings.  But Bruce does finally hire a professional our narrator.  ALT Of course Jason overhears their discussion and thinks Bruce is planning to send him away.  ALT Ouch.  Jason decides to prove that he‚Äôs totally fine actually by saving a gala from Scarecrow by himself. Did you guess that he gets hit with fear toxin? Because yeah they always get hit with fear toxin!  ALTALTALT Oh my god he just wanted his mom to save him üò≠  ALT OH GOD FOR A SECOND I FORGOT IT WAS FEAR TOXIN  I should take a second to jump back and note that Jason imagining Joker getting one right between the eyes just like we saw at the start feels like a solid indication that in the end he will definitely be Joker‚Äôs killer‚Ä¶ but well you really don‚Äôt know until it happens.  So Jason is out of commission but before Scarecrow can kidnap him for interrogation Batman finally shows up. Bruce beats the everloving crap out of Crane obviously still consumed with anger about what happened in Ethiopia. The freaking cops have to ask him to stop.  ALT And then the final page is just more of the saddest of sadtimes.  ALT I do love that first narrative detail in the top panel. Bruce is feeling angry and guilty but also humiliated and ashamed. He knows Jason is a vulnerable kid who needs help but as always Jason also represents Bruce‚Äôs personal failures. He couldn‚Äôt get Jason to do exactly as he was told. He couldn‚Äôt protect Jason from harm. He couldn‚Äôt maintain the image of Batman as invulnerable not with this terrified boy shaking on the ground. Bruce does not have control.  It‚Äôs very human and it‚Äôs a key ingredient in whatever disaster is to come. Even if we didn‚Äôt have Sara‚Äôs final questions in the last two panels we can already tell that Bruce is going to continue to make not-great choices.  I‚Äôve already ordered #2 and I‚Äôm looking forward to reading what DeMatteis has in store in the next three issues. Barbara has to make an appearance right? And she‚Äôd be a great candidate for the shooter‚Ä¶,2024-07-11 00:20:44 GMT

He was too young to understand why they wouldn‚Äôt just wake up the little dress pants that he wore to the theatre now damp with blood as he pushed poked and prodded his parents‚Äô heavy bodies. His voice grows more and more worried as time passes for he can see the color draining from their skin ever so slowly revealing veins that have begun to transition from blue to purple. His soft whine becoming a full screaming sob.  It‚Äôs only after roughly half an hour of continuous wailing that lights appear in the surrounding houses and apartments. Disgruntled residents telling him to shut up and more empathetic people checking on him from their windows. It was only one man that came out to see the horrors the boy had witnessed. Not too soon after Gotham Police Department arrives with a young junior detective and his senior partner.  A grizzled Harvey Bullock with sunken eyes from years of sleep deprivation and a rasp in his voice from the combination of chain smoking and hard liquor orders James Gordon to quell the cries of the boy. Jim looks uneasy with his orders. He‚Äôs never been good with kids but he watches intently as the boy heaves deep breaths and chokes on the spit and snot pouring from his face.  A gentle hand touches the young Wayne‚Äôs shoulder clasping it as if to offer reassurance.  ‚ÄúMy name is Jim. Can you tell me your name?‚Äù Jim is careful not to mess up the scene as he gingerly crouches behind the boy.  ‚ÄúB-b-br-bruce.‚Äù The boy stutters trying to collect himself. A Wayne must be strong. That‚Äôs what dad always said.  ‚ÄúBruce? I‚Äôm sorry we had to meet like this‚Äù says Jim as he tries to ask empathetically ‚ÄúBruce do you think we can talk more? I have friends that can watch them for you. Why don‚Äôt you take a break?‚Äù  The boy then looks behind him to find the gap-toothed sympathetic smile of a lightskin black man with freckles and ginger hair under the soft yellowed glow of street lamps. And in the night air are the screeches of bats as they hunt for insects‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¶  10-year-old Clark Kent awoke from his sleep in a sweat. He could have sworn he had heard the sound of a gunshot as if were right beside him. His ears were ringing. He stumbled out of the motel bed shambled to the bathroom and promptly lost his dinner.  As he was cleaning up the sink which he vomited into he went to twist the knob to rinse it out. It must have gotten looser since they were using it earlier. Before it stuck a little and while not hard to turn did require a little more effort.   As Clark removes his hand from the knob he sees why it was so much easier to turn. He looks intently at the cracks in the plastic knob and when he went to tap it it crumbled into hard clear shards.  Clark laid back down thinking he must be in some fever-induced dream but he had a hard time going back to bed. Not only did he feel as if he was moving faster than his mind was moving as he walked back to the bed but as he laid there with eyes shut tight it was as if he could see through his own eyelids.   Clark continued to lay down now just staring through his eyelids at the ceiling above him. He decided to quiet his mind by thinking of home. He couldn‚Äôt wait to get back home. He missed the farm. He missed the trees. He even missed his chores. He was ready to harvest the corn they had grown for the summer and play with the cows in the barn. He didn‚Äôt like the thick air of Metropolis; it smelled of car exhaust and sewage. Though he honestly couldn‚Äôt tell if that was the fault of Metropolis or the city of Gotham across the Delaware Bay. But the constant noise of cars and yelling protests against STAR labs and sirens zooming down the streets that was definitely Metropolis. The flash of cameras blinding him whenever Mama and Pop took him to look at the city. Eager journalists and paparazzi alike looking to get the scoop on anything and everything. Where there should be tall trees and bustling forests there were instead skyscrapers and just behemoth concrete and metal structures. No he wanted no part of it he just wanted to be back on the Kent farm in Gallatin.  Eventually Clark dozes off thinking about home and his friends there. He dreams of his best friend Alex and the lab in his garage. He dreams of his dad landing his STAR labs contract so they can go back home and start working again. He dreams of home but is seeing a man and a woman and can‚Äôt make out their faces but their bodies don‚Äôt resemble Mama and Pop‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs while he dreams these things that his body begins to hover a little over a foot in the air.   A true sight for his mother and father to see when they go to wake him up for a city tour at 9am. Perhaps it‚Äôs time to have the talk with Clark‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¶  ‚ÄúARES! GIVE ME YOUR COURAGE! ATHENA! YOUR WISDOM! KRATOS! BLESS ME WITH STRENGTH! HERMES! LET ME POSSESS YOUR SPEED! ZEUS! FUCK YOU!‚Äù A mighty high-pitched battle cry from young warrior Diana of Themiscyra. ‚ÄúYOUR LIGHTNING MAY HAVE LIT THE FIRES OF MY KILN BUT YOU HOLD NO POWER OVER ME!‚Äù  ‚ÄúWatch your words Diana. We revere the gods. They allow us to live and bless us with what we need to live.‚Äù Queen Hippolyta scolds her daughter. ‚ÄúZeus heard my cries to mother a child and gave me you. I thank him daily.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMy queen I respect you and the other gods. But I do not recognize Zeus as the King of Gods as that would make him my king. And I serve no man.‚Äù  Her mother can do nothing but chuckle as lightning crackles across the sky. My daughter molded of clay and born by lightning. I think he sees your power and knows the threat you pose to him. I will protect you from him. Train you to be the best Amazon to have walked the Earth.  ‚ÄúAre you done praying child?‚Äù Hippolyta dawns her helmet and grabs her spear; shifting her feet to prepare for what comes next. Her stance is strong she looks nigh unmovable. A necessary skill against her current opponent.  ‚ÄúNot yet mater.‚Äù Diana grins at her mother slyly. Without breaking eye contact Diana retrieves her shield from the boulder she lodged it in during the last spar and unsheathed the sword on her belt. ‚ÄúASCLEPIUS! KEEP MY MOTHER HEALTHY! PAEON! PATCH UP WHAT YOU MUST AFTER!‚Äù I will dethrone Zeus and protect those I love from tyrants like him.  Lightning strikes the fighting pit leaving glass shards scattered across the arena. Fuck you Zeus Hippolyta says in her mind and the spar continues‚Ä¶,2024-07-11 06:09:47 GMT

He‚Äôs such an asshole like even more than usual in current comics? Also bordering on being careless and killing especially in the Two-Face part of the comic. He really is so unsympathetic also kinda curt with Harvey when they confronted each other for the first time in this comic but that might be bc of the panelling.   Speaking of Two-Face; THE IMPROMPTU BRAIN SURGERY??? Is it medical malpractice if you dont have a license because i think Bruce just went a step too far. Its one thing to practice field medicine/basics without formal hospital training (not to say he didnt have training/good education on it but yk) but BRAIN SURGERY??? Did i miss something??? Back to the violence he really was going to town like‚Ä¶ idk. What is it with writers making him beat the information out of people so much and so violently like gang‚Ä¶ stop it.

I do miss the days Bruce said please and thank you on the regular(ish) i really liked that subtle thing about him. Such a polite young man.

This isn‚Äôt the first time but I feel like this round struck much closer.  Although this is the website where people are open about mental illness there‚Äôs still a reluctance to address the ‚Äúloud‚Äù or ‚Äúfrightening‚Äù or ‚Äúangry‚Äù or ‚Äúmessy‚Äù side of it. Stuff like bipolar schizophrenia addiction PTSD. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm extremely hesitant to talk about my own problems even under anonymity.   Conversely there are mainline comics (and other media) that use this category of mental illness as an excuse for characters to go all-out in their aggression. Even if not intentional it perpetuates the idea that a trigger will always send the person spiraling until either the worst happens or someone steps in as the ‚Äúhero.‚Äù It‚Äôs basically sending the message to people like me that we‚Äôre a ticking time bomb.   Then there‚Äôs WFA. Jason‚Äôs not fully present during his episode. It leads him into a dangerous situation while at the same time he‚Äôs unable to grasp things like pain. The adrenaline and the overwhelming sense of fear drives him into fight mode. He gets tunnel vision while he‚Äôs beating up the bar patrons to try and find the Joker. Without getting into details I‚Äôve been in Jason‚Äôs shoes. I‚Äôve found myself in risky places doing things I‚Äôd later regret. All because of the disconnect from reality that makes me believe what I‚Äôm doing is necessary. Not even justified just necessary. Almost like a survival instinct.   And what‚Äôs so important is that Jason isn‚Äôt a villain and Dick isn‚Äôt a savior. Dick reaffirms Jason‚Äôs trauma and guides him through tangible steps rather than giving broad sweeping advice. Of course there‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all coping method but the biggest thing is having somebody in your corner who sees you beyond this bad episode. Sometimes I have that sometimes I don‚Äôt. WFA won‚Äôt show it since it‚Äôs all about family but the times I didn‚Äôt have someone were exponentially scarier.   At the same time there are consequences that a simple grounding exercise can‚Äôt remedy‚ÄîJason got hurt he hurt others and his appearance at Noonan‚Äôs definitely put him on someone‚Äôs radar if not the Joker. And they‚Äôre just as real as his feelings and (hopefully) he‚Äôs gonna be held accountable. Because that‚Äôs how it goes in real life. Something sets me off I screw up I get bailed out and once I come down from it I have to fix the mess I made.   Maybe I‚Äôm just reading too much into a fan comic. But I know that if a few panels can resonate so closely with me then it‚Äôs worth talking about because someone somewhere is also feeling the same way.,2024-07-11 06:51:00 GMT

Bruce and Harvey are friends.  May I present: All three grew up together.  They met at a park one day or even on the first day of first grade and decided that they were gonna be friends forever.  They all probably kissed once just to see what it would be like. They also made a promise to marry each other/move in together if they weren‚Äôt in a committed relationship by a certain age.  They definitely planned to work together in the future all having to do something with the law. They were gonna be the good guys kicking ass together because there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd ever stop being friends.  And then Bruce‚Äôs parents were killed.  And then they couldn‚Äôt all go to the same high school because Harley lived in Park Row and Harvey lived in Old Gotham and Bruce lived in Bristol.  And then Bruce disappeared.  And then Harley went insane.  And suddenly Harvey was the only one left.  But Bruce came back! And Batman appeared. And Harvey was busting his ass trying to keep the city safe while also reconnecting with Bruce and telling him what happened to Harley. Harley joins The Joker entering a relationship with him.  Batman has to keep locking Harley away in the very place she wanted to help people and Bruce dies a bit every time because that‚Äôs his friend he keeps putting there.  Harvey goes insane calling himself Two-Face.  And suddenly Bruce is the only one left.  None of them are doing what they set out to do.  Harley - in nice terms - is no longer with Joker. Harvey is still in and out of Arkham. Bruce now has three two kids.  Harley reforms getting the help she needed but she doesn‚Äôt go back to what she‚Äôd grown up wanting to do. Harvey keeps going through the revolving door that is Arkham Asylum but he knows Batman won‚Äôt hurt him because Bruce would never hurt his friends on purpose.

2,Batman,['joker war'  'bruce wayne'  'the joker war'],catboybatman,Started The Joker War‚Ä¶‚Ä¶??? Why WE manufacturing weapons all of a sudden?? I thought there was a basic understanding that they didnt do that? Also Bruce is written a lot more violent/worse than in Tomasi‚Äôs comics before this? Whats up with that? He‚Äôs such an asshole like even more than usual in current comics? Also bordering on being careless and killing especially in the Two-Face part of the comic. He really is so unsympathetic also kinda curt with Harvey when they confronted each other for the first time in this comic but that might be bc of the panelling.   Speaking of Two-Face; THE IMPROMPTU BRAIN SURGERY??? Is it medical malpractice if you dont have a license because i think Bruce just went a step too far. Its one thing to practice field medicine/basics without formal hospital training (not to say he didnt have training/good education on it but yk) but BRAIN SURGERY??? Did i miss something??? Back to the violence he really was going to town like‚Ä¶ idk. What is it with writers making him beat the information out of people so much and so violently like gang‚Ä¶ stop it. Idk maybe Tomasi rewatched the Nolan movies for this.   He and Kate are kinda cute tho. I do miss the days Bruce said please and thank you on the regular(ish) i really liked that subtle thing about him. Such a polite young man. But thats what you get if you jump around between older comics and current ones i guess. Speaking of: the difference between the detective work then and now‚Ä¶ oh how i miss the times before that damned speaking computer. When he put stuff in the analyzing machines and came to his own conclusions. I mean really it would already improve so much if they just had Bruce read out/think the computer conclusions rather than have some digital voice say it. Especially because im 75% sure that isnt how that works. Anyway. Whatever,2024-07-11 08:57:06 GMT

Bruce and Harvey are friends.  May I present: All three grew up together.  They met at a park one day or even on the first day of first grade and decided that they were gonna be friends forever.  They all probably kissed once just to see what it would be like. They also made a promise to marry each other/move in together if they weren‚Äôt in a committed relationship by a certain age.  They definitely planned to work together in the future all having to do something with the law. They were gonna be the good guys kicking ass together because there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd ever stop being friends.  And then Bruce‚Äôs parents were killed.  And then they couldn‚Äôt all go to the same high school because Harley lived in Park Row and Harvey lived in Old Gotham and Bruce lived in Bristol.  And then Bruce disappeared.  And then Harley went insane.  And suddenly Harvey was the only one left.  But Bruce came back! And Batman appeared. And Harvey was busting his ass trying to keep the city safe while also reconnecting with Bruce and telling him what happened to Harley. Harley joins The Joker entering a relationship with him.  Batman has to keep locking Harley away in the very place she wanted to help people and Bruce dies a bit every time because that‚Äôs his friend he keeps putting there.  Harvey goes insane calling himself Two-Face.  And suddenly Bruce is the only one left.  None of them are doing what they set out to do.  Harley - in nice terms - is no longer with Joker. Harvey is still in and out of Arkham. Bruce now has three two kids.  Harley reforms getting the help she needed but she doesn‚Äôt go back to what she‚Äôd grown up wanting to do. Harvey keeps going through the revolving door that is Arkham Asylum but he knows Batman won‚Äôt hurt him because Bruce would never hurt his friends on purpose. Bruce now has 7 kids two of which he can‚Äôt officially adopt because one still has living family and the other doesn‚Äôt want that. Bruce and Harley reconnect.,2024-07-11 10:59:11 GMT

Bruce and Harvey are friends.  May I present: All three grew up together.  They met at a park one day or even on the first day of first grade and decided that they were gonna be friends forever.  They all probably kissed once just to see what it would be like. They also made a promise to marry each other/move in together if they weren‚Äôt in a committed relationship by a certain age.  They definitely planned to work together in the future all having to do something with the law. They were gonna be the good guys kicking ass together because there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd ever stop being friends.  And then Bruce‚Äôs parents were killed.  And then they couldn‚Äôt all go to the same high school because Harley lived in Park Row and Harvey lived in Old Gotham and Bruce lived in Bristol.  And then Bruce disappeared.  And then Harley went insane.  And suddenly Harvey was the only one left.  But Bruce came back! And Batman appeared. And Harvey was busting his ass trying to keep the city safe while also reconnecting with Bruce and telling him what happened to Harley. Harley joins The Joker entering a relationship with him.  Batman has to keep locking Harley away in the very place she wanted to help people and Bruce dies a bit every time because that‚Äôs his friend he keeps putting there.  Harvey goes insane calling himself Two-Face.  And suddenly Bruce is the only one left.  None of them are doing what they set out to do.  Harley - in nice terms - is no longer with Joker. Harvey is still in and out of Arkham. Bruce now has three two kids.  Harley reforms getting the help she needed but she doesn‚Äôt go back to what she‚Äôd grown up wanting to do. Harvey keeps going through the revolving door that is Arkham Asylum but he knows Batman won‚Äôt hurt him because Bruce would never hurt his friends on purpose. Bruce now has 7 kids two of which he can‚Äôt officially adopt because one still has living family and the other doesn‚Äôt want that. Bruce and Harley reconnect.,2024-07-11 10:59:11 GMT

He shifts from foot to foot running through the routine in his head one last time. John Grayson turns back and smiles at him momentarily.   In a matter of moments the quiet snap of wires will alert Dick something is wrong a split second before anyone else notices followed by twin impacts. One sickening crunch will ring through the crowd before the screaming starts when they realize it isn‚Äôt part of the show.   Dick‚Äôs life will never be the same after this not remotely.   ‚Äî   An experiment is made of mistakes. Therefore it would be logical to conclude that if enough things go horribly wrong eventually something that makes it worth it will happen.

She retired from her role as a super villain and carved out a life for herself a life as a civilian.   Some forty years later the reformed villain found herself caring for a pair of twin granddaughters named Delia and Deirdre Dennis. These two sisters were quite the handful. Although ‚ÄòGrandma Harley‚Äô did her best to steer them in the right it was not to be as the sisters had inherited from their grandmother her hunger for action and mayhem as well as the propensity to fall under the sway of smooth-talking scoundrels done up like clowns.   In their early teens Delia and Deirdre fell in with the gang of hooligans known as The Jokerz. Both sisters were highly accomplished gymnasts and hand-to-hand fighters and they took on the joint alias of ‚ÄòDeeDee.‚Äô At first they joined a gang led by an angry cad named Bonk but it was not long before the gang was taken over by a mysterious man who by all rights appeared to be a resurrected Joker.   The Joker sent the gang to steel various components that would eventually enable him to take control of an orbital weapons platform that could fire destructive particle beams down unto earth. The gang remained largely in the dark of the leader‚Äôs ultimately plan and in that he had viciously murdered Bonk none were brave enough to question the matter.   Batman was ultimately able to thwart this plan and stop The Joker. DeeDee and the rest of the Jokerz gang were apprehended.

762,Batman,['cassandra cain'  'batgirl'  'everyone should read batgirl (2000) right now'  'barbara gordon'  'stephanie brown'  'bruce wayne'],casscainmainly,My Top 10 Batgirl (2000) Moments This is my list of top 10 Batgirl (2000) moments!! There were so many to choose from but these are my personal favs :)). Counting down from 10 to my absolute favourite.  10. Volving An absolute classic. Perfectly encapsulates what Cass does throughout the entire run and more writers should play with Cass‚Äô use of language like this!  9. Beat Up Every Mob In Gotham Perfect encapsulation of the early Barbara-Cass dynamic and one of the funniest moments in the series. Just love the expressions and the way this shows so much of Cass‚Äô character.  8. Choosing to Write The entirety of issue #2 builds up to this heart-wrenching moment. After delivering a dead man‚Äôs final message to his wife Cass sees the wife‚Äôs reaction to the written message and decides to learn to write. A foundational moment for her character and a nice motherly Babs scene too.   7. Alpha Redemption Capping off issues 35 + 36 Batgirl unmasks herself to convince Alpha (an amnesiac villain) that he doesn‚Äôt have to be defined by his past. Brilliantly displays her core belief that people can change and the fact that her belief pays off makes this moment extremely moving.  6. For God‚Äôs Sake Possibly a controversial pick but I really like this moment because it underscores some of the fundamental conflict between Babs and Cass. They love each other but they don‚Äôt always understand each other particularly in regards to each other‚Äôs disabilities. A painful moment that should have been explored more.   5. Fight For Your Life My favourite Stephanie and Cass moment in this run. You can feel Cass‚Äô grief throughout this hallucination but there‚Äôs also so much hope and love (for Stephanie and for herself). It‚Äôs an amazing conclusion to Cass‚Äô initial suicidal tendencies: instead of desiring death she now actively fights to live.   4. Darknight Detectives  This interaction sums up a lot of Bruce and Cass‚Äô best moments. Cass‚Äô unwavering moral beliefs Bruce‚Äôs pride their instinctive understanding of each other; they just get each other in a way few others do. I picked this one instead of the ‚Äòinstinct/good answer‚Äô moment because it also marks Cass‚Äô development in her detective ability. From Moment 8 above to here the confidence in her mental capacities has grown so much. She really volved!  3. Perfect For A Year I mean of course this had to be here. These lines literally take up 90% of my brain space it‚Äôs an incredibly tense moment that illustrates Cass‚Äô desire to be perfect her need to be useful and good. This issue is also just awesome.  2. You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ Not Another absolute classic. Illustrates Cass‚Äô compassion and her belief that people aren‚Äôt defined by their lineage which is particularly personal to her given her own dad. This struggle between good/bad parent/child defines many of Cass‚Äô best stories.  1. Who Do You Think You Are? + Father‚Äôs Day What else would number 1 be?? Issue 33 is my favourite in the entire run and the entire thing is stacked with moments that could fill up this list. I just love &#x27;who do you think you are‚Äô because it‚Äôs all of Cass‚Äô rage spilling out and yet she still loves David Cain in her own complicated way (and he reciprocates too). Then we have the ending which is the BEST Bruce and Cass moment ever. The sparse meaningful dialogue the expressions the reveal of the TITLE: comic book writing at its finest.   Honorary mention to the Shiva/Cass fight which just narrowly missed out.,2024-07-11 20:43:17 GMT

Iced coffee is easier to down quickly. It‚Äôs quicker to make and in his opinion lighter on the palate.

Everyone thinks he is being sarcastic intentionally. He is not. That is his face and the ground is also moving.   -pain meds  I feel like with Tim he sits on both extremes most of the time and this is true with pain meds. He thinks that giving himself ANY painkillers is blocking off his body‚Äôs way of communicating with him because pain is just a signal that something is wrong.   However if it is too bad so that he cannot move or get what he needs to done he is totally on board. He is so high he feels absolutely nothing and can be seen waving to giant spiders. (It‚Äôs Gotham.

24,Batman,['bane'  'dc bane'  'bane dc'  'bruce wayne'],purebot,I love Bane‚Ä¶.underrated in the fandom‚Ä¶Gonna go on a tangent  I think it‚Äôs crazy how little I feel I see him acknowledged in fandom posts. I think people fall under the idea that he‚Äôs just another big dumb strongman when the point of his whole existence as a character is literally the opposite he‚Äôs made to oppose Batman in both body AND mind. That he was imprisoned his whole life and believes he is innocent from any crime he now commits because he‚Äôs already served his time from birth he did.   He is TRAGIC!! And in both live action depictions of him he‚Äôs reduced down to nothing but a henchman. They even gave Talia his backstory in tdkr and in Batman&amp;Robin he could hardly speak besides repeating words that were spoken to him. Those depictions are so far off from what Bane is supposed to be. I think Arkham Origins (we ignore the end‚Ä¶) was really good and so was Telltale Bane because holy shit they actually let him have his INTELLIGENCE and PERSONALITY!!   I‚Äôll go crazy about underrated characters. Which is wild because Bane is such a prominent rogue. But anything I see of him is 90% about tdrk which hot take is so garbage &amp; not even remotely close to what Bane should be üò≠ man‚Ä¶,2024-07-11 22:05:51 GMT

It could be blizzarding out and a chilled XL iced Americano with 2 extra shots and one pump SF vanilla and hazelnut each will be cradled is hands.   However he can justify his pickiness. Iced coffee is easier to down quickly. It‚Äôs quicker to make and in his opinion lighter on the palate. (He doesn‚Äôt take price into account like at all and Jason loves to bring this up)   -Squinty face  He does this thing when he has been up for too long where he tilts his head and squints his eyes because he honestly can‚Äôt tell if he is hallucinating yet. Everyone thinks he is being sarcastic intentionally. He is not. That is his face and the ground is also moving.   -pain meds  I feel like with Tim he sits on both extremes most of the time and this is true with pain meds. He thinks that giving himself ANY painkillers is blocking off his body‚Äôs way of communicating with him because pain is just a signal that something is wrong.   However if it is too bad so that he cannot move or get what he needs to done he is totally on board. He is so high he feels absolutely nothing and can be seen waving to giant spiders. (It‚Äôs Gotham.

Author Note: My laptop has died and trying to format the screenshots I made of their texts is proving to send me over the edge. I swear there‚Äôs more.     August Twenty-first  There had been small introductions as time passed. With his secret still safe and kept locked away I proved to be more of an asset with what knowledge I carry from years of consuming stories. But there were some failsafes put in place: Only information that was necessary would be given freely I wouldn‚Äôt talk about the Gotham Gallery unless they showed up and I reserved the right to not say things in the event that it could seriously damage a timeline. You felt the last one was a bit of a copout but after plenty of pleading Batman acquiesced.   In the wee hours of the morning Bruce is still out galavanting around the Gotham skyline. He‚Äôd managed to stop two muggings and a robbery this evening. While he is working I am learning to man the computer with Alfred. According to Bruce it was time I made myself useful if Alfred insisted that I be around the property as he liked to keep a closer eye on me.  But like I‚Äôm helping Batman at the Bat Computer. That‚Äôs fucking dope.  After midnight though it had been oddly quiet. Batman is following a lead down at Gotham Dockyards. The warehouse catwalk that Bats was perched on left him fairly exposed if a rogue flashlight pointed in his direction.  His cowl and earpiece were synced together and able to do text-to-voice when he was in stealth mode. As the newest member of Team Bat I am given a direct line to him. A bonus during my training. Alfred asked me to fire off a message to him to test it out.     &lt;!-- more --&gt; I toss my phone onto the desk in a huff narrowly missing a few controls and I sulk back into the chair. Alfred shoots a look over his shoulder with a chuckle. ‚ÄúIt appears that the sync between your phone and the suit works well.‚Äù  ‚ÄúApparently‚Äù I deadpan. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an ass.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe may be my lady. But he‚Äôs the financier for this entire endeavor and as you pointed out with your knowledge he is the world‚Äôs greatest detective. Try to not let him get to you.‚Äù  When Batman‚Äôs feed scans out over the warehouses I can see that there isn‚Äôt much going on thankfully. He‚Äôd gotten a tip from a small-time drug dealer that there was going to be a movement of product near Wearhouse Eight around two this morning.  The mob had been pushing boundaries a little lately and as more wiseguys were getting locked up courtesy of the caped crusader they were trying to get more creative on how they moved their supply in through and out of Gotham.     Though he would come home restless on the quieter nights his adrenaline not having had any sort of cathartic outlet I am silently grateful when he would come home unscathed. At least on Alfred‚Äôs behalf.  Not that Alfred wasn‚Äôt already having me put some of my newly learned medical skills to good use on the days where he would need IVs or mild first aid but I couldn‚Äôt fathom how someone would willingly put themselves through this day in and out.  But I‚Äôm also not a masked vigilante and that‚Äôs not entirely a thing where I‚Äôm from.     ‚ÄúAlfred‚Äù Batman tapped the earpiece in his cowl.  ‚ÄúYes Master Bruce?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm revoking her contact privileges.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do nothing of the sort. It‚Äôs a second form of safety that I for one am exceedingly grateful to have in the event that there‚Äôs an emergency and I am indisposed.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhen have you ever been that indisposed?‚Äù  Alfred scoffs ‚ÄúThat is entirely beside the point Batman. She‚Äôs another set of eyes and ears when you are out at night. Over time I think she could be an integral part of The Batman‚Äôs operations. Give her time to adapt.‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe made you those scones you like didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶yes.‚Äù Alfred chuckles and sends an updated schematic to Batman‚Äôs wrist communicator. ‚ÄúRegardless instigating her as Bruce Wayne in the daylight shouldn‚Äôt preclude you from her retaliation when you‚Äôre out as The Batman.‚Äù  Air passes quickly through Batman‚Äôs nostrils in a mild snort before he jumps to a rooftop. ‚ÄúSounds like you‚Äôre on Chase‚Äôs side over mine.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI am not taking sides. I am merely making an observation.‚Äù  There‚Äôs a hum of acceptance rumbling in his throat while his eyes scan across the docks. The only sound he can hear is the mild lapping of water against the piers; and after his earlier run ins perhaps it was best the night had gone quiet.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to give it another twenty minutes. Maybe the intel wasn‚Äôt good. It‚Äôs quiet and it doesn‚Äôt look like anyone‚Äôs around.‚Äù     ‚ÄúTHE SHIT DID YOU SAY THAT FOR?!‚Äù I shout helping to haul Batman‚Äôs body across the table after he‚Äôd staggered off of his bike. ‚ÄúYOU STUPID FUCKING‚Ä¶!‚Äù  ‚ÄúChase‚Äù Alfred reprimands in warning while he retrieves the medical kit from across the lobby of the cave. When he returns he sets me in motion to check vitals.  ‚ÄúFucking stupid‚Äù I mutter ripping the cowl off his head and tossing it aside. While I shine the pen light in his eyes and check for a possible concussion I keep berating him quietly.  ‚Äú ‚ÄòOh it‚Äôs so quiet out. Oh it‚Äôs so calm‚Äô.  ‚ÄúWho says that you moron! Nurses say it? ER gets slammed. Cooks say it? Biggest rush of the night. Cops say it? Whole fucking precinct is hopping. And you think it‚Äôs a good idea as one guy in his pajamas flouncing around at night to say it while you were in the middle of the mob‚Äôs territory?  ‚ÄúFucking stupid.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough Chase.‚Äù Alfred‚Äôs voice cuts into my monologue. ‚ÄúHelp me get the suit off now.‚Äù  It‚Äôs a whole process to get Bruce out of the suit on a good day. There‚Äôs an order that the pieces are put on and taken off. He‚Äôs got it down to a science and can get ready in under five minutes if he is truly pressed for time.  But now? It is unbearably difficult to get him out of his ballistic skin because he keeps writhing on the table and his suit is slick with blood.  ‚ÄúMaster Bruce stay still‚Äù Alfred commands as he fills up a syringe. It‚Äôs one of the cocktails he has included in the kit over the past few years with something for infection.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for this‚Äù I hiss between gnashing teeth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cutting him out of the pants. I can‚Äôt get to whatever‚Äôs bleeding!‚Äù  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare‚Äù Bruce growls. ‚ÄúJust get me out of the suit.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get this off you! You‚Äôre not exactly helping and I haven‚Äôt taken Batsuit 101 yet you asshole!‚Äù  The trauma shears do not make a dent through the tactical fabric and armor much less cut it open.  ‚ÄúWayne Tech‚Äù Bruce laughs while he tries to peel off his gauntlets with Alfred‚Äôs help. ‚ÄúPricey. Made to withstand‚Ä¶‚Äù  You snatch one of the scalpels from the tray and start slicing into the fabric. Bruce is frozen dumbfounded and Alfred takes this opportunity to administer his cocktail into Bruce‚Äôs now exposed thigh.     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move.‚Äù  While my eyes are locked onto his each word is punctuated with an edge as sharp as the tool in my hand before I cut my way from his waist to his ankle. With some assistance from Alfred in peeling blood-soaked tactical fabric from sweat-slick skin my eyes begin evaluating the damage. A four-inch slash runs along his inner thigh from where he had a run in with a switchblade.  To his credit Batman was spartan-kicking a guy off of the steel catwalk in the warehouse when the guy took a piece of Batman with him as he fell.  ‚ÄúEvaluate Chase.‚Äù  Your eyes snap up to Alfred whose stoic demeanor gives me enough of an inclination that Bruce isn‚Äôt in any mortal danger. Regardless I sit stunned for a beat before I physically shake my head and stare back at the wound.  ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious‚Äù Bruce groans sitting up on his elbows. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to just let her take over?‚Äù  You blink twice before irrigating the area and wound ‚ÄúYeah what he said.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis is an unfortunate but necessary component to working with The Batman‚Äù he nods before walking to retrieve a suture kit. ‚ÄúHe will be injured from time to time. He bleeds. He needs time to recover and heal. More time than those bloody comics of yours allow.‚Äù  He washes his hands and opens the kit for me. ‚ÄúClean yourself up. I‚Äôll slow the bleeding down with a tourniquet. But you‚Äôll be fixing him up because you can and because you must.‚Äù  Any argument dies on my tongue and I take my leave to scrub my hands. Over the sound of rushing water I hear Bruce arguing with Alfred presumably over my insertion into the medical aspect of tonight‚Äôs events. The exchanging of words and the fervor with which Bruce seems to voice his displeasure are enough to sow doubt in my mind.  ‚Äú‚Ä¶because you can and because you must‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúAlright Alfred. I can stitch him up once you‚Äôve cleaned the wound out. You did say my sutures look better than yours‚Äù I try to make light of the situation before me with false bravado.  The butler nods cleans the wound and situates a towel across Bruce‚Äôs lap.  ‚ÄúI will be close my lady. But you need to act quickly.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI know‚Äù I agree clinically. ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt start now I won‚Äôt jump to it when it really counts.‚Äù  He hums quietly to himself. ‚ÄúType of stitch you plan to use? Remember your patient doesn‚Äôt listen and tends to not follow doctor‚Äôs orders.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI can hear you you know‚Äù Bruce turns his head to side-eye Alfred. ‚ÄúPretending I‚Äôm not here isn‚Äôt going to help.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking an interrupted vertical mattress suture will work that way if he pulls a stitch the whole set isn‚Äôt shot. And maybe a little on a zig-zag to minimize scarring?‚Äù  ‚ÄúIn this particular instance I‚Äôd be partial to the continuous subcuticular. But your logic is sound enough. You‚Äôre using monocryl so it‚Äôll be absorbed over time assuming he doesn‚Äôt rip his leg open.‚Äù  You nod pull the needle through his skin. Bruce jumps and slams his hands on the table.  ‚ÄúBefore you growl at her again‚Äù Alfred reaches across him to the tray. ‚ÄúI have another shot to administer.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThanks for the anesthetic Alfred. Don‚Äôt feel like getting stabbed more than once today‚Äù the vigilante‚Äôs dark humor ebbing into the conversation.  You peer up over Bruce‚Äôs leg at Alfred and ask ‚ÄúWhy the subcuticular? Doesn‚Äôt that hurt?‚Äù  ‚ÄúOf course it does.‚Äù  Bruce closes his eyes and rights his head on the table ‚ÄúYou make it sound like you stitch vengefully on purpose.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOnly when you deserve to learn a lesson Master Bruce.‚Äù  The needle lances through his skin after I tie off another suture and he flinches.  ‚ÄúHow long until the anesthetic kicks in?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat anesthetic? I administered a tetanus shot‚Äù Alfred mumbles sitting down at the nearby chair to monitor my work. Bruce cracks an eye open at him and scowls.  ‚ÄúI suggest you harken back on the training you have to regulate your own pain and come to terms with it while Chase is here with us. She‚Äôs a part of this team now Master Bruce.‚Äù     With only two stitches left to go my row is neat and nearly looks like it could be photographed for a textbook. Alfred occasionally interjected a word here and there to either make me pause or propel me forward but all in all this wasn‚Äôt the worst experience. I mean I am sewing up Batman but‚Ä¶you know.   Wearing his blood up to my elbows a mistake of wiping my brow with my forearm caused a smear of rust to mar my face.  ‚ÄúTwo left Bruce. How are you doing?‚Äù the words quiet but not unkind.  ‚ÄúFine‚Äù he all but grumbles from up the table.  In truth I feel poorly about how Alfred‚Äôs done him dirty tonight. You didn‚Äôt intend to start a family dispute nor did I relish the fact another human being was in pain at the expense of my needle. There was a point where I tried to reach for a vial so that I could administer local anesthetic near the wound but Alfred tutted at me and asked that I get back to work.  ‚ÄúHe will not always have the luxury of pain medication my lady. He can relearn that lesson tonight too.‚Äù  Not once did Bruce twitch or flinch after that while I sewed him up; his eyes closing and more than likely putting his body into a meditative state. An apology fell from my lips when I thought I had dug too deeply with the needle halfway through the gash but still he hadn‚Äôt moved.  With the final suture tied off and cut the scissors and needle are dropped into the tray with a loud clang disturbing the mild peace that had settled over the three of us. Alfred‚Äôs keen eyes had watched my handiwork every step of the way and I feel them upon me again when I stand to stretch.  ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you head upstairs‚Äù he stands behind me with a gentle hand on my shoulder ‚ÄúAnd shower for the night Miss Chase. I‚Äôll see to Master Bruce and get him to bed.‚Äù  Autopilot has me nod in agreement or resignation. I don‚Äôt think I could tell which at this point after the last of the adrenaline left my system. All the same I head upstairs and shower until the rust in the runoff runs clean.     The past week had afforded me a courtesy while I worked nights for Batman: I‚Äôd been afforded a guest room at Alfred‚Äôs behest and Bruce‚Äôs grunted agreement. God it had the plushest mattress I‚Äôve ever slept on. Tonight though? It calls to me after I get out of the shower and I want nothing more than to collapse into it and wake up sometime after noon like Wayne tends to do. But my mind returns back to the tone of voice Bruce used and his adamant refusal for my assistance.   It continues to replay in my mind over and over until I find myself downstairs swiping my keys from the hook in the garage and then I‚Äôm leaving the property. The city lights streak over my windshield as the first tendrils of dawn creep at the horizon. The pedal to my car flattens out my car glinting through what remains of the city‚Äôs shadows; that‚Äôs when I find myself inside the living room of my apartment.  Pieces of the night are hazy while others maintain exceptional clarity. How I drove here is a little foggy: I don‚Äôt really remember the traffic or the actual driving nothing outside of the speed grounding me to reality.     It‚Äôs not that I owe him anything. I don‚Äôt. Telling myself that I don‚Äôt over and over is becoming a mantra I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd put into daily practice. A memory of that phrase being repeated the whole way home surfaced briefly before it dissolves into another where I am stitching his leg up with the same thing going through my head.  It shouldn‚Äôt bother me that he‚Äôs hurt or that he might be pissed at me. He‚Äôs the one that keeps galavanting out at night regardless of the risks regardless of how well versed he is in martial arts. Though he‚Äôs still around the age of a freshly graduated college kid. He‚Äôs young. He‚Äôs human.  It shouldn‚Äôt pull at my mind and heart.  But it does.        ‚ÄúYou will go down to that shop and apologize to her‚Äù the butler‚Äôs normally calm demeanor is far more bristly this afternoon.  Wayne pushes himself up in bed and winces the stitches pinching as he moves. ‚ÄúYou both said that I need to rest so that I can heal and now you want me to get out of bed and go down there? Mixed signals at best.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat woman stitched you up better than I do‚Äù he snaps ‚Äúand she fled out of here after her shower before I could tell her as much. This is your fault.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMy fault?‚Äù his voice still rough with sleep. Alfred rips open the curtains and Bruce shirks from the afternoon light. ‚ÄúHow is this my fault?‚Äù  ‚ÄúMaster Bruce I‚Äôm saying this with all due respect but you need to figure out if you want her to be here or not.  ‚ÄúYou cannot keep changing your mind pending the situation deciding if you find utility in her participation here. Miss Chase is navigating your mood swings and indecisiveness as best she can.  ‚ÄúYou are already enough of a liability being a part of my life Alfred‚Äù Bruce growls and leans forward. ‚ÄúHow many times did people take shots at you to get to me growing up? You think having another person around is going to make that more manageable?  ‚ÄúI know how much you want this to work because it‚Äôs a means of keeping me safe. I can wholly understand that but‚Äù he looks around the room exasperated ‚Äúwhat I do isn‚Äôt safe. Protecting Gotham doesn‚Äôt put me into a line of safety.‚Äù  Alfred sighs ‚ÄúI understand that Master Bruce. But in this singular circumstance having that additional shroud and information would be of more benefit than your pessimistic foresight.  ‚ÄúFurthermore while I understand the delicacy of the matter and the circumstances of this operation rather acutely shouldn‚Äôt it be her decision?‚Äù        From the back room I hear how gravel tears into the fabric of Cujo‚Äôs voice and the sudden cease of work on the shop floor. There‚Äôs murmuring back and forth between men it‚Äôs all I can do to finish throwing towels into the dryer before going to investigate what‚Äôs going on.  ‚ÄúYou got a lotta nerve showing up here‚Äù Cujo gnashes out shoulders square to the intruder.  ‚ÄúLook‚Äù a pacifying baritone floats over amped up testosterone ‚ÄúI just need to talk to her.‚Äù  I round the corner and see all four guys creating a wall between me and the perceived threat who happens to sound a lot like Bruce.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the hell you did to her‚Äù Irish points a finger in Wayne‚Äôs direction. ‚ÄúThe past two days she‚Äôs be borderline silent without so much as a fucking sarcastic comment. And we know that she went to your place after work the other night.‚Äù  Jax crosses himself and I take quiet measured steps into the room. ‚ÄúYeah. And if you‚Äôre gonna come in here and tell us that your butler is the one that made her upset you got another thing comin‚Äô. That dude‚Äôs the sweetest to her outside of us.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI came down here to apologize to her‚Äù Bruce tries to placate.  Not that Batman couldn‚Äôt take all four of the shop guys Bruce Wayne is a bit of a pansy with a lot of the storytelling I‚Äôve been doing as of late. He doesn‚Äôt want to have to cross lines if he doesn‚Äôt have to.  While I do happen to get a little glee from this part of the song and dance routine and much to my better judgment I rest a hand on Cujo‚Äôs shoulder and wedge myself through.  A quirk of a brow and attitude settles into my voice ‚ÄúThen apologize.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLook can we go somewhere and talk?‚Äù  Irish takes a step forward ‚ÄúWhy you afraid to say what you wanna say in front of us?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYeah a little‚Äù Bruce allows and I chuckle to myself. He makes a point to shift from one leg to the other and looks across the room. ‚ÄúI should get friends like you have Chase. Jeez.‚Äù  When I take another step forward Jax puts a hand on my elbow. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to go with him girl. He can stay right here if you want; or we can throw his bitch-ass out.‚Äù  I laugh and pat his hand. ‚ÄúFunny as that would be I think he‚Äôd rather do his groveling without an audience. Or you four scaring the shit out of him. I‚Äôll humor him this time.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll text you if he needs his ass beat. Chances are he wouldn‚Äôt be able to get to his car before you got to him.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDamn straight.‚Äù Dozer glares daggers at Wayne before begrudgingly turning to his client and going back to work.  There‚Äôs a wave of relief that cascades down Bruce‚Äôs body before he holds the front door open for me to pass through.  We walk for a few minutes in silence the humid June air is stifling in the Gotham heat. I can‚Äôt help but let my mind wander for a few minutes thinking about how nice it is that the shop is in the East End and only a block from the Sprang River; how there‚Äôs a really comforting cross breeze coming up from the water. The guys would probably prop the door open today to help with the heat.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing some thinking‚Äù Bruce‚Äôs voice drops into its more comfortable Batman range. ‚ÄúAnd I need you to listen.‚Äù  When I stop along the river walk he follows suit and I cross my arms in front of my chest. ‚ÄúI need to listen? I thought this was supposed to be an apology. Because if it is you suck at this.‚Äù  His eyes narrow and he bites back ‚ÄúAre you always this much of a pain in the ass?‚Äù  I feel something twist in my gut a vice that ignites a guilted rage at feeling sorry for him the other night. Why do I feel empathy for this asshole? He‚Äôs a privileged ass with more issues than I‚Äôm equipped to deal with. Why did I have to get stuck here of all places.  ‚ÄúYou know what Bruce? I can just walk back to that shop and those guys will never let you walk back in again.‚Äù  He smirks and stuffs his hands in his pockets. ‚ÄúThey could try. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll go the way they would think it should.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh come off it‚Äù I groan. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to go after a bunch of innocent men trying to protect someone who‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo you come off it‚Äù he growls back forcefully shedding his suit jacket and draping it over his arm. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try and play games. This is real Chase. All of this; all that I do is my reality every single day. Don‚Äôt you dare stand there and try to pull some lofty stance on how I should conduct myself.‚Äù  Bruce leans his forearms on the stone wall and gazes across the water towards The Bowery.  ‚ÄúWhat I do isn‚Äôt safe Chase. I‚Äôm trying to get you to understand that.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAs the person who‚Äôs got some of the mythology in my skull pretty sure I know what you‚Äôre about.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different when it‚Äôs real. A veteran knows war differently than someone reading about it in a history book.‚Äù  Intrigued I move closer and lean on the wall with him lowering my voice ‚ÄúI can appreciate that statement.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIn your talks with Alfred has he brought up what happened when I was twelve?‚Äù I shake my head and he nods without looking at me eyes still focused across the river.  ‚ÄúAlfred had been waiting for me to finish school. I had French and Japanese lessons after school that semester‚Äù he ponders thoughtfully.   ‚ÄúThe French lesson was only three blocks away and we usually walked it for the sake of keeping up appearances as Bruce Wayne. He‚Äôd park out front of the building walk to the school collect me and walk me to my lesson. We‚Äôd done it for a few years and I didn‚Äôt think much of it. There‚Äôd always been some level of hesitancy or feeling as if I was always being watched. The Son of Gotham was always under a microscope; I still am to a degree.  ‚ÄúOne day in February‚Ä¶right before my birthday actually I came out to the courtyard and Alfred wasn‚Äôt there. He‚Äôd never not been where he was supposed to be. My teacher snatched me by my shoulder before I could take off to find him and dragged me inside. Guess Alfred and I owe her for that one.‚Äù  ‚ÄúGood‚Äù the word blurts out of me before I can catch myself turning to stare at him. ‚ÄúAt twelve? What would you have been able to do Bruce? Alfred wouldn‚Äôt have wanted you to do something so rash.‚Äù  Bruce looks over at me with a knowing expression. ‚ÄúHmpf. Sounds like a lecture I‚Äôve gotten from him once before. What makes you say that?‚Äù  ‚ÄúBecause I wouldn‚Äôt want Ayla to do something stupid like that.‚Äù I clear the lump in my throat and turn back to the water.  ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd been jumped and taken hostage when the robbers realized I wasn‚Äôt with him. When he refused to give me up or act as bait they beat him. They‚Äôd had him for a few days before they cut him loose after GCPD had put out a bolo and done a press conference on it.  ‚ÄúAlfred had a broken rib a concussion a couple broken fingers‚Ä¶all because they wanted to get me.‚Äù  A heavy sigh escapes him bowing his head and closing his eyes. ‚ÄúSpeaking of our recent history anyone that gets close to a Wayne ends up beaten bloody or dead. What if that‚Äôs something that Alfred and I don‚Äôt want for you?‚Äù  I mean he‚Äôs got a point. Assuming that this isn‚Äôt psychosis and I‚Äôm not in a coma or hell and this genuinely is my reality now‚Ä¶is that something that I‚Äôm willing to risk? What if there‚Äôs a way to go home and I end up permanently getting stuck here or I can‚Äôt get back because I‚Äôm hurt or kidnapped?  But again what if this is the way life is going to be? I don‚Äôt owe him anything. But something keeps whispering to me that this is where I‚Äôm supposed to be I guess. That this is what I should be doing.  And that‚Äôs stupid.  ‚ÄúConsidering the sheer absurdity of it all I don‚Äôt really think that matters. Look if you want me to help fine. If not that‚Äôs also fine. I get it from the logic of it all. But you‚Äôve been an absolute jackass to me lately‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚Äú‚Ä¶I know‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚Äú‚Ä¶and all I‚Äôm trying to do is help out and do the things that you and Alfred ask of me but you just brood and grouch over it because ‚ÄòI like to jump around in my underoos in the dark and I am the night‚Äô. And God forbid anyone else come to help out‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúChase‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚Äú‚Ä¶because I have to do everything alone and I‚Äôm sad and broody. Newsflash mister everything you‚Äôve done or will do is because of family so‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù  My mind shorts out mid-ramble and I blink a few times almost as if I‚Äôm resetting like a damn computer.  The organic smell of the river hits my senses like a truck and I do a sharp inhale before peering over to Bruce who is now turned toward me with one elbow on the wall.  ‚ÄúLook I am sorry. I know that you mean well and can be an asset to the team I can see that. But It‚Äôs just been Alfred and I for nearly two years working on this thing. How are you supposed to integrate into the team and be safe?‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù I offer turning around to face the street and lean back as coolly as possible. ‚ÄúI can tell you that on paper I understand the risks that I‚Äôm getting myself into. I know how some of those stories end. I also fully understand that you aren‚Äôt going to always be able to bail me out of things simply because you are who you are.  ‚ÄúBut if you don‚Äôt want me working for you I won‚Äôt be broadcasting anything. I‚Äôm not that spiteful. Besides who‚Äôd believe me?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre oddly patient with me about all of this.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI know‚Äù I laugh with a smile shaking my head. ‚ÄúNo idea why.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWant a job?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI already have one of those‚Äù my hands slip into my pockets and I motion with my head for him to follow me back to the shop. ‚ÄúUnless you‚Äôre offering a supplemental position.‚Äù  Bruce catches up. ‚ÄúSomething like that. Interested?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI might be. How‚Äôs the pay?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNegotiable considering.‚Äù  I shrug ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs something I can pencil into my schedule.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to make sure you‚Äôre in my good graces in the future or I know four very protective barbers that‚Äôll try their best to kick your ass.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI have no doubt that they wouldn‚Äôt do their damndest‚Äù his tone much lighter than it had been at the start of the conversation.  When we reach the shop the guys leer out the window for any sign of distress on my part and I wave them all off. The smell of product Barbasol and Dozer‚Äôs burnt coffee swirl in the air but at least the cool breeze from the river is doing something for the heat.  Bruce apologizes again and shakes my hand rather officially in view of his jury.  An idea sparks in my mind when he turns to leave. ‚ÄúQuestion for you.‚Äù  ‚ÄúShoot.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhen you were in Paris on your ‚Äòsojourn‚Äô‚Äù I add finger quotes in the air ‚ÄúDid you meet Lucius Fox?‚Äù  Bruce‚Äôs eyes shift from side to side and he takes a step back towards me. ‚ÄúI did. He‚Äôd worked for my father at one point I just happened to be in the right place at the right time and stopped a mugging. I try to be a good upstanding citizen when I can be. Why?‚Äù  ‚ÄúSomething for you to think about later I suppose.‚Äù  There is a small hum that rattles in his chest paired with a knowing nod before he turns on his heel and heads for his car. ‚ÄúAlfred expects you for dinner after work this evening. I‚Äôll inform him that you‚Äôre coming.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù  Cujo watches from the doorway as Bruce slides into his car and drives off. When I turn to look at him there‚Äôs an air of skepticism about him and I can‚Äôt help but wonder how his intuition must be going off like an alarm bell.  ‚ÄúHe apologize enough?‚Äù  Crossing the threshold and heading to the coffee pot I dump its burnt contents and begin making a new half pot to get us through the afternoon.  ‚ÄúYeah Cujo he did. He might be a pansy-ass bitch but he‚Äôs not heartless.‚Äù  Irish points his clippers at me and waves them in the air ‚ÄúHe messes with you like that again he has us to answer to. I‚Äôll burn his house down. On God.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll come to that‚Äù I try and pacify them with my charm and easy smile. ‚ÄúWe talked out our issue like adults and know where each other stands on it‚Ä¶not that we won‚Äôt potentially argue in the future but you know‚Ä¶‚Äù  Jax jabs an elbow into Dozer‚Äôs side and snickers ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it like being one of us and a friend of Bruce Wayne‚Äôs?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Cujo leans forward on the counter listening intently.  ‚ÄúAll I mean is that dude‚Äôs richer than God right? And I ain‚Äôt ever seen a single tabloid where he‚Äôs got a circle of friends around him like us ya know? But then Chase winds up in Gotham and now Wayne‚Äôs nearly a regular down at the shop checking in on her.  ‚ÄúEither that or he thinks she‚Äôs fine as hell.‚Äù  Dozer shoves Jax playfully across the room the shop erupting into a roar of laughter. I wipe tears from the corners of my eyes wheezing and sputtering while I try to regain some semblance of control over this conversation.  ‚ÄúWell God knows if I wasn‚Äôt going to go on a date with Dozer after he so valiantly saved my life Wayne‚Äôs not got a chance.  ‚ÄúBesides he‚Äôs not that bad honestly. Imagine growing up and having to second guess every single interaction and friendship you had because you had money status or the Wayne name. How many people tried to take advantage of that after his parents died you think? If anything he probably appreciates the fact I‚Äôm honest and call him out on his bullshit.‚Äù  ‚ÄúGirl where were you when we were growin‚Äô up‚Äù Irish hollers from his chair. ‚ÄúCan you imagine how much trouble we wouldn‚Äôt have gotten in to had she been around? Damn.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat or we woulda just ignored her and done it anyway‚Äù Jax laughs and dabs up Irish.  Cujo shakes his head and pours himself a coffee. ‚ÄúNah. The way y‚Äôall wrapped around her finger now? You‚Äôda been done for when we were young. Woulda done anything she wanted. You woulda been a bunch of choir boys and I wouldn‚Äôt have had to bail your asses out of so much of that hood shit.  ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs more than meets the eye with Chase boys. Probably always will be. A lady of mystery. Our lady of mystery.‚Äù  I pour my own cup of coffee and clink it off of Cujo‚Äôs with a smile ‚ÄúI‚Äôll drink to that.‚Äù,2024-07-12 00:56:31 GMT

Author Note: My laptop has died and trying to format the screenshots I made of their texts is proving to send me over the edge. I swear there‚Äôs more.     August Twenty-first  There had been small introductions as time passed. With his secret still safe and kept locked away I proved to be more of an asset with what knowledge I carry from years of consuming stories. But there were some failsafes put in place: Only information that was necessary would be given freely I wouldn‚Äôt talk about the Gotham Gallery unless they showed up and I reserved the right to not say things in the event that it could seriously damage a timeline. You felt the last one was a bit of a copout but after plenty of pleading Batman acquiesced.   In the wee hours of the morning Bruce is still out galavanting around the Gotham skyline. He‚Äôd managed to stop two muggings and a robbery this evening. While he is working I am learning to man the computer with Alfred. According to Bruce it was time I made myself useful if Alfred insisted that I be around the property as he liked to keep a closer eye on me.  But like I‚Äôm helping Batman at the Bat Computer. That‚Äôs fucking dope.  After midnight though it had been oddly quiet. Batman is following a lead down at Gotham Dockyards. The warehouse catwalk that Bats was perched on left him fairly exposed if a rogue flashlight pointed in his direction.  His cowl and earpiece were synced together and able to do text-to-voice when he was in stealth mode. As the newest member of Team Bat I am given a direct line to him. A bonus during my training. Alfred asked me to fire off a message to him to test it out.     &lt;!-- more --&gt; I toss my phone onto the desk in a huff narrowly missing a few controls and I sulk back into the chair. Alfred shoots a look over his shoulder with a chuckle. ‚ÄúIt appears that the sync between your phone and the suit works well.‚Äù  ‚ÄúApparently‚Äù I deadpan. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an ass.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe may be my lady. But he‚Äôs the financier for this entire endeavor and as you pointed out with your knowledge he is the world‚Äôs greatest detective. Try to not let him get to you.‚Äù  When Batman‚Äôs feed scans out over the warehouses I can see that there isn‚Äôt much going on thankfully. He‚Äôd gotten a tip from a small-time drug dealer that there was going to be a movement of product near Wearhouse Eight around two this morning.  The mob had been pushing boundaries a little lately and as more wiseguys were getting locked up courtesy of the caped crusader they were trying to get more creative on how they moved their supply in through and out of Gotham.     Though he would come home restless on the quieter nights his adrenaline not having had any sort of cathartic outlet I am silently grateful when he would come home unscathed. At least on Alfred‚Äôs behalf.  Not that Alfred wasn‚Äôt already having me put some of my newly learned medical skills to good use on the days where he would need IVs or mild first aid but I couldn‚Äôt fathom how someone would willingly put themselves through this day in and out.  But I‚Äôm also not a masked vigilante and that‚Äôs not entirely a thing where I‚Äôm from.     ‚ÄúAlfred‚Äù Batman tapped the earpiece in his cowl.  ‚ÄúYes Master Bruce?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm revoking her contact privileges.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do nothing of the sort. It‚Äôs a second form of safety that I for one am exceedingly grateful to have in the event that there‚Äôs an emergency and I am indisposed.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhen have you ever been that indisposed?‚Äù  Alfred scoffs ‚ÄúThat is entirely beside the point Batman. She‚Äôs another set of eyes and ears when you are out at night. Over time I think she could be an integral part of The Batman‚Äôs operations. Give her time to adapt.‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe made you those scones you like didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶yes.‚Äù Alfred chuckles and sends an updated schematic to Batman‚Äôs wrist communicator. ‚ÄúRegardless instigating her as Bruce Wayne in the daylight shouldn‚Äôt preclude you from her retaliation when you‚Äôre out as The Batman.‚Äù  Air passes quickly through Batman‚Äôs nostrils in a mild snort before he jumps to a rooftop. ‚ÄúSounds like you‚Äôre on Chase‚Äôs side over mine.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI am not taking sides. I am merely making an observation.‚Äù  There‚Äôs a hum of acceptance rumbling in his throat while his eyes scan across the docks. The only sound he can hear is the mild lapping of water against the piers; and after his earlier run ins perhaps it was best the night had gone quiet.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to give it another twenty minutes. Maybe the intel wasn‚Äôt good. It‚Äôs quiet and it doesn‚Äôt look like anyone‚Äôs around.‚Äù     ‚ÄúTHE SHIT DID YOU SAY THAT FOR?!‚Äù I shout helping to haul Batman‚Äôs body across the table after he‚Äôd staggered off of his bike. ‚ÄúYOU STUPID FUCKING‚Ä¶!‚Äù  ‚ÄúChase‚Äù Alfred reprimands in warning while he retrieves the medical kit from across the lobby of the cave. When he returns he sets me in motion to check vitals.  ‚ÄúFucking stupid‚Äù I mutter ripping the cowl off his head and tossing it aside. While I shine the pen light in his eyes and check for a possible concussion I keep berating him quietly.  ‚Äú ‚ÄòOh it‚Äôs so quiet out. Oh it‚Äôs so calm‚Äô.  ‚ÄúWho says that you moron! Nurses say it? ER gets slammed. Cooks say it? Biggest rush of the night. Cops say it? Whole fucking precinct is hopping. And you think it‚Äôs a good idea as one guy in his pajamas flouncing around at night to say it while you were in the middle of the mob‚Äôs territory?  ‚ÄúFucking stupid.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough Chase.‚Äù Alfred‚Äôs voice cuts into my monologue. ‚ÄúHelp me get the suit off now.‚Äù  It‚Äôs a whole process to get Bruce out of the suit on a good day. There‚Äôs an order that the pieces are put on and taken off. He‚Äôs got it down to a science and can get ready in under five minutes if he is truly pressed for time.  But now? It is unbearably difficult to get him out of his ballistic skin because he keeps writhing on the table and his suit is slick with blood.  ‚ÄúMaster Bruce stay still‚Äù Alfred commands as he fills up a syringe. It‚Äôs one of the cocktails he has included in the kit over the past few years with something for infection.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for this‚Äù I hiss between gnashing teeth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cutting him out of the pants. I can‚Äôt get to whatever‚Äôs bleeding!‚Äù  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare‚Äù Bruce growls. ‚ÄúJust get me out of the suit.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get this off you! You‚Äôre not exactly helping and I haven‚Äôt taken Batsuit 101 yet you asshole!‚Äù  The trauma shears do not make a dent through the tactical fabric and armor much less cut it open.  ‚ÄúWayne Tech‚Äù Bruce laughs while he tries to peel off his gauntlets with Alfred‚Äôs help. ‚ÄúPricey. Made to withstand‚Ä¶‚Äù  You snatch one of the scalpels from the tray and start slicing into the fabric. Bruce is frozen dumbfounded and Alfred takes this opportunity to administer his cocktail into Bruce‚Äôs now exposed thigh.     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move.‚Äù  While my eyes are locked onto his each word is punctuated with an edge as sharp as the tool in my hand before I cut my way from his waist to his ankle. With some assistance from Alfred in peeling blood-soaked tactical fabric from sweat-slick skin my eyes begin evaluating the damage. A four-inch slash runs along his inner thigh from where he had a run in with a switchblade.  To his credit Batman was spartan-kicking a guy off of the steel catwalk in the warehouse when the guy took a piece of Batman with him as he fell.  ‚ÄúEvaluate Chase.‚Äù  Your eyes snap up to Alfred whose stoic demeanor gives me enough of an inclination that Bruce isn‚Äôt in any mortal danger. Regardless I sit stunned for a beat before I physically shake my head and stare back at the wound.  ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious‚Äù Bruce groans sitting up on his elbows. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to just let her take over?‚Äù  You blink twice before irrigating the area and wound ‚ÄúYeah what he said.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis is an unfortunate but necessary component to working with The Batman‚Äù he nods before walking to retrieve a suture kit. ‚ÄúHe will be injured from time to time. He bleeds. He needs time to recover and heal. More time than those bloody comics of yours allow.‚Äù  He washes his hands and opens the kit for me. ‚ÄúClean yourself up. I‚Äôll slow the bleeding down with a tourniquet. But you‚Äôll be fixing him up because you can and because you must.‚Äù  Any argument dies on my tongue and I take my leave to scrub my hands. Over the sound of rushing water I hear Bruce arguing with Alfred presumably over my insertion into the medical aspect of tonight‚Äôs events. The exchanging of words and the fervor with which Bruce seems to voice his displeasure are enough to sow doubt in my mind.  ‚Äú‚Ä¶because you can and because you must‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúAlright Alfred. I can stitch him up once you‚Äôve cleaned the wound out. You did say my sutures look better than yours‚Äù I try to make light of the situation before me with false bravado.  The butler nods cleans the wound and situates a towel across Bruce‚Äôs lap.  ‚ÄúI will be close my lady. But you need to act quickly.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI know‚Äù I agree clinically. ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt start now I won‚Äôt jump to it when it really counts.‚Äù  He hums quietly to himself. ‚ÄúType of stitch you plan to use? Remember your patient doesn‚Äôt listen and tends to not follow doctor‚Äôs orders.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI can hear you you know‚Äù Bruce turns his head to side-eye Alfred. ‚ÄúPretending I‚Äôm not here isn‚Äôt going to help.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking an interrupted vertical mattress suture will work that way if he pulls a stitch the whole set isn‚Äôt shot. And maybe a little on a zig-zag to minimize scarring?‚Äù  ‚ÄúIn this particular instance I‚Äôd be partial to the continuous subcuticular. But your logic is sound enough. You‚Äôre using monocryl so it‚Äôll be absorbed over time assuming he doesn‚Äôt rip his leg open.‚Äù  You nod pull the needle through his skin. Bruce jumps and slams his hands on the table.  ‚ÄúBefore you growl at her again‚Äù Alfred reaches across him to the tray. ‚ÄúI have another shot to administer.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThanks for the anesthetic Alfred. Don‚Äôt feel like getting stabbed more than once today‚Äù the vigilante‚Äôs dark humor ebbing into the conversation.  You peer up over Bruce‚Äôs leg at Alfred and ask ‚ÄúWhy the subcuticular? Doesn‚Äôt that hurt?‚Äù  ‚ÄúOf course it does.‚Äù  Bruce closes his eyes and rights his head on the table ‚ÄúYou make it sound like you stitch vengefully on purpose.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOnly when you deserve to learn a lesson Master Bruce.‚Äù  The needle lances through his skin after I tie off another suture and he flinches.  ‚ÄúHow long until the anesthetic kicks in?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat anesthetic? I administered a tetanus shot‚Äù Alfred mumbles sitting down at the nearby chair to monitor my work. Bruce cracks an eye open at him and scowls.  ‚ÄúI suggest you harken back on the training you have to regulate your own pain and come to terms with it while Chase is here with us. She‚Äôs a part of this team now Master Bruce.‚Äù     With only two stitches left to go my row is neat and nearly looks like it could be photographed for a textbook. Alfred occasionally interjected a word here and there to either make me pause or propel me forward but all in all this wasn‚Äôt the worst experience. I mean I am sewing up Batman but‚Ä¶you know.   Wearing his blood up to my elbows a mistake of wiping my brow with my forearm caused a smear of rust to mar my face.  ‚ÄúTwo left Bruce. How are you doing?‚Äù the words quiet but not unkind.  ‚ÄúFine‚Äù he all but grumbles from up the table.  In truth I feel poorly about how Alfred‚Äôs done him dirty tonight. You didn‚Äôt intend to start a family dispute nor did I relish the fact another human being was in pain at the expense of my needle. There was a point where I tried to reach for a vial so that I could administer local anesthetic near the wound but Alfred tutted at me and asked that I get back to work.  ‚ÄúHe will not always have the luxury of pain medication my lady. He can relearn that lesson tonight too.‚Äù  Not once did Bruce twitch or flinch after that while I sewed him up; his eyes closing and more than likely putting his body into a meditative state. An apology fell from my lips when I thought I had dug too deeply with the needle halfway through the gash but still he hadn‚Äôt moved.  With the final suture tied off and cut the scissors and needle are dropped into the tray with a loud clang disturbing the mild peace that had settled over the three of us. Alfred‚Äôs keen eyes had watched my handiwork every step of the way and I feel them upon me again when I stand to stretch.  ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you head upstairs‚Äù he stands behind me with a gentle hand on my shoulder ‚ÄúAnd shower for the night Miss Chase. I‚Äôll see to Master Bruce and get him to bed.‚Äù  Autopilot has me nod in agreement or resignation. I don‚Äôt think I could tell which at this point after the last of the adrenaline left my system. All the same I head upstairs and shower until the rust in the runoff runs clean.     The past week had afforded me a courtesy while I worked nights for Batman: I‚Äôd been afforded a guest room at Alfred‚Äôs behest and Bruce‚Äôs grunted agreement. God it had the plushest mattress I‚Äôve ever slept on. Tonight though? It calls to me after I get out of the shower and I want nothing more than to collapse into it and wake up sometime after noon like Wayne tends to do. But my mind returns back to the tone of voice Bruce used and his adamant refusal for my assistance.   It continues to replay in my mind over and over until I find myself downstairs swiping my keys from the hook in the garage and then I‚Äôm leaving the property. The city lights streak over my windshield as the first tendrils of dawn creep at the horizon. The pedal to my car flattens out my car glinting through what remains of the city‚Äôs shadows; that‚Äôs when I find myself inside the living room of my apartment.  Pieces of the night are hazy while others maintain exceptional clarity. How I drove here is a little foggy: I don‚Äôt really remember the traffic or the actual driving nothing outside of the speed grounding me to reality.     It‚Äôs not that I owe him anything. I don‚Äôt. Telling myself that I don‚Äôt over and over is becoming a mantra I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd put into daily practice. A memory of that phrase being repeated the whole way home surfaced briefly before it dissolves into another where I am stitching his leg up with the same thing going through my head.  It shouldn‚Äôt bother me that he‚Äôs hurt or that he might be pissed at me. He‚Äôs the one that keeps galavanting out at night regardless of the risks regardless of how well versed he is in martial arts. Though he‚Äôs still around the age of a freshly graduated college kid. He‚Äôs young. He‚Äôs human.  It shouldn‚Äôt pull at my mind and heart.  But it does.        ‚ÄúYou will go down to that shop and apologize to her‚Äù the butler‚Äôs normally calm demeanor is far more bristly this afternoon.  Wayne pushes himself up in bed and winces the stitches pinching as he moves. ‚ÄúYou both said that I need to rest so that I can heal and now you want me to get out of bed and go down there? Mixed signals at best.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat woman stitched you up better than I do‚Äù he snaps ‚Äúand she fled out of here after her shower before I could tell her as much. This is your fault.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMy fault?‚Äù his voice still rough with sleep. Alfred rips open the curtains and Bruce shirks from the afternoon light. ‚ÄúHow is this my fault?‚Äù  ‚ÄúMaster Bruce I‚Äôm saying this with all due respect but you need to figure out if you want her to be here or not.  ‚ÄúYou cannot keep changing your mind pending the situation deciding if you find utility in her participation here. Miss Chase is navigating your mood swings and indecisiveness as best she can.  ‚ÄúYou are already enough of a liability being a part of my life Alfred‚Äù Bruce growls and leans forward. ‚ÄúHow many times did people take shots at you to get to me growing up? You think having another person around is going to make that more manageable?  ‚ÄúI know how much you want this to work because it‚Äôs a means of keeping me safe. I can wholly understand that but‚Äù he looks around the room exasperated ‚Äúwhat I do isn‚Äôt safe. Protecting Gotham doesn‚Äôt put me into a line of safety.‚Äù  Alfred sighs ‚ÄúI understand that Master Bruce. But in this singular circumstance having that additional shroud and information would be of more benefit than your pessimistic foresight.  ‚ÄúFurthermore while I understand the delicacy of the matter and the circumstances of this operation rather acutely shouldn‚Äôt it be her decision?‚Äù        From the back room I hear how gravel tears into the fabric of Cujo‚Äôs voice and the sudden cease of work on the shop floor. There‚Äôs murmuring back and forth between men it‚Äôs all I can do to finish throwing towels into the dryer before going to investigate what‚Äôs going on.  ‚ÄúYou got a lotta nerve showing up here‚Äù Cujo gnashes out shoulders square to the intruder.  ‚ÄúLook‚Äù a pacifying baritone floats over amped up testosterone ‚ÄúI just need to talk to her.‚Äù  I round the corner and see all four guys creating a wall between me and the perceived threat who happens to sound a lot like Bruce.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the hell you did to her‚Äù Irish points a finger in Wayne‚Äôs direction. ‚ÄúThe past two days she‚Äôs be borderline silent without so much as a fucking sarcastic comment. And we know that she went to your place after work the other night.‚Äù  Jax crosses himself and I take quiet measured steps into the room. ‚ÄúYeah. And if you‚Äôre gonna come in here and tell us that your butler is the one that made her upset you got another thing comin‚Äô. That dude‚Äôs the sweetest to her outside of us.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI came down here to apologize to her‚Äù Bruce tries to placate.  Not that Batman couldn‚Äôt take all four of the shop guys Bruce Wayne is a bit of a pansy with a lot of the storytelling I‚Äôve been doing as of late. He doesn‚Äôt want to have to cross lines if he doesn‚Äôt have to.  While I do happen to get a little glee from this part of the song and dance routine and much to my better judgment I rest a hand on Cujo‚Äôs shoulder and wedge myself through.  A quirk of a brow and attitude settles into my voice ‚ÄúThen apologize.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLook can we go somewhere and talk?‚Äù  Irish takes a step forward ‚ÄúWhy you afraid to say what you wanna say in front of us?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYeah a little‚Äù Bruce allows and I chuckle to myself. He makes a point to shift from one leg to the other and looks across the room. ‚ÄúI should get friends like you have Chase. Jeez.‚Äù  When I take another step forward Jax puts a hand on my elbow. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to go with him girl. He can stay right here if you want; or we can throw his bitch-ass out.‚Äù  I laugh and pat his hand. ‚ÄúFunny as that would be I think he‚Äôd rather do his groveling without an audience. Or you four scaring the shit out of him. I‚Äôll humor him this time.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll text you if he needs his ass beat. Chances are he wouldn‚Äôt be able to get to his car before you got to him.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDamn straight.‚Äù Dozer glares daggers at Wayne before begrudgingly turning to his client and going back to work.  There‚Äôs a wave of relief that cascades down Bruce‚Äôs body before he holds the front door open for me to pass through.  We walk for a few minutes in silence the humid June air is stifling in the Gotham heat. I can‚Äôt help but let my mind wander for a few minutes thinking about how nice it is that the shop is in the East End and only a block from the Sprang River; how there‚Äôs a really comforting cross breeze coming up from the water. The guys would probably prop the door open today to help with the heat.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing some thinking‚Äù Bruce‚Äôs voice drops into its more comfortable Batman range. ‚ÄúAnd I need you to listen.‚Äù  When I stop along the river walk he follows suit and I cross my arms in front of my chest. ‚ÄúI need to listen? I thought this was supposed to be an apology. Because if it is you suck at this.‚Äù  His eyes narrow and he bites back ‚ÄúAre you always this much of a pain in the ass?‚Äù  I feel something twist in my gut a vice that ignites a guilted rage at feeling sorry for him the other night. Why do I feel empathy for this asshole? He‚Äôs a privileged ass with more issues than I‚Äôm equipped to deal with. Why did I have to get stuck here of all places.  ‚ÄúYou know what Bruce? I can just walk back to that shop and those guys will never let you walk back in again.‚Äù  He smirks and stuffs his hands in his pockets. ‚ÄúThey could try. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll go the way they would think it should.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh come off it‚Äù I groan. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to go after a bunch of innocent men trying to protect someone who‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo you come off it‚Äù he growls back forcefully shedding his suit jacket and draping it over his arm. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try and play games. This is real Chase. All of this; all that I do is my reality every single day. Don‚Äôt you dare stand there and try to pull some lofty stance on how I should conduct myself.‚Äù  Bruce leans his forearms on the stone wall and gazes across the water towards The Bowery.  ‚ÄúWhat I do isn‚Äôt safe Chase. I‚Äôm trying to get you to understand that.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAs the person who‚Äôs got some of the mythology in my skull pretty sure I know what you‚Äôre about.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different when it‚Äôs real. A veteran knows war differently than someone reading about it in a history book.‚Äù  Intrigued I move closer and lean on the wall with him lowering my voice ‚ÄúI can appreciate that statement.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIn your talks with Alfred has he brought up what happened when I was twelve?‚Äù I shake my head and he nods without looking at me eyes still focused across the river.  ‚ÄúAlfred had been waiting for me to finish school. I had French and Japanese lessons after school that semester‚Äù he ponders thoughtfully.   ‚ÄúThe French lesson was only three blocks away and we usually walked it for the sake of keeping up appearances as Bruce Wayne. He‚Äôd park out front of the building walk to the school collect me and walk me to my lesson. We‚Äôd done it for a few years and I didn‚Äôt think much of it. There‚Äôd always been some level of hesitancy or feeling as if I was always being watched. The Son of Gotham was always under a microscope; I still am to a degree.  ‚ÄúOne day in February‚Ä¶right before my birthday actually I came out to the courtyard and Alfred wasn‚Äôt there. He‚Äôd never not been where he was supposed to be. My teacher snatched me by my shoulder before I could take off to find him and dragged me inside. Guess Alfred and I owe her for that one.‚Äù  ‚ÄúGood‚Äù the word blurts out of me before I can catch myself turning to stare at him. ‚ÄúAt twelve? What would you have been able to do Bruce? Alfred wouldn‚Äôt have wanted you to do something so rash.‚Äù  Bruce looks over at me with a knowing expression. ‚ÄúHmpf. Sounds like a lecture I‚Äôve gotten from him once before. What makes you say that?‚Äù  ‚ÄúBecause I wouldn‚Äôt want Ayla to do something stupid like that.‚Äù I clear the lump in my throat and turn back to the water.  ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd been jumped and taken hostage when the robbers realized I wasn‚Äôt with him. When he refused to give me up or act as bait they beat him. They‚Äôd had him for a few days before they cut him loose after GCPD had put out a bolo and done a press conference on it.  ‚ÄúAlfred had a broken rib a concussion a couple broken fingers‚Ä¶all because they wanted to get me.‚Äù  A heavy sigh escapes him bowing his head and closing his eyes. ‚ÄúSpeaking of our recent history anyone that gets close to a Wayne ends up beaten bloody or dead. What if that‚Äôs something that Alfred and I don‚Äôt want for you?‚Äù  I mean he‚Äôs got a point. Assuming that this isn‚Äôt psychosis and I‚Äôm not in a coma or hell and this genuinely is my reality now‚Ä¶is that something that I‚Äôm willing to risk? What if there‚Äôs a way to go home and I end up permanently getting stuck here or I can‚Äôt get back because I‚Äôm hurt or kidnapped?  But again what if this is the way life is going to be? I don‚Äôt owe him anything. But something keeps whispering to me that this is where I‚Äôm supposed to be I guess. That this is what I should be doing.  And that‚Äôs stupid.  ‚ÄúConsidering the sheer absurdity of it all I don‚Äôt really think that matters. Look if you want me to help fine. If not that‚Äôs also fine. I get it from the logic of it all. But you‚Äôve been an absolute jackass to me lately‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚Äú‚Ä¶I know‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚Äú‚Ä¶and all I‚Äôm trying to do is help out and do the things that you and Alfred ask of me but you just brood and grouch over it because ‚ÄòI like to jump around in my underoos in the dark and I am the night‚Äô. And God forbid anyone else come to help out‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúChase‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚Äú‚Ä¶because I have to do everything alone and I‚Äôm sad and broody. Newsflash mister everything you‚Äôve done or will do is because of family so‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù  My mind shorts out mid-ramble and I blink a few times almost as if I‚Äôm resetting like a damn computer.  The organic smell of the river hits my senses like a truck and I do a sharp inhale before peering over to Bruce who is now turned toward me with one elbow on the wall.  ‚ÄúLook I am sorry. I know that you mean well and can be an asset to the team I can see that. But It‚Äôs just been Alfred and I for nearly two years working on this thing. How are you supposed to integrate into the team and be safe?‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù I offer turning around to face the street and lean back as coolly as possible. ‚ÄúI can tell you that on paper I understand the risks that I‚Äôm getting myself into. I know how some of those stories end. I also fully understand that you aren‚Äôt going to always be able to bail me out of things simply because you are who you are.  ‚ÄúBut if you don‚Äôt want me working for you I won‚Äôt be broadcasting anything. I‚Äôm not that spiteful. Besides who‚Äôd believe me?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre oddly patient with me about all of this.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI know‚Äù I laugh with a smile shaking my head. ‚ÄúNo idea why.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWant a job?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI already have one of those‚Äù my hands slip into my pockets and I motion with my head for him to follow me back to the shop. ‚ÄúUnless you‚Äôre offering a supplemental position.‚Äù  Bruce catches up. ‚ÄúSomething like that. Interested?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI might be. How‚Äôs the pay?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNegotiable considering.‚Äù  I shrug ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs something I can pencil into my schedule.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to make sure you‚Äôre in my good graces in the future or I know four very protective barbers that‚Äôll try their best to kick your ass.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI have no doubt that they wouldn‚Äôt do their damndest‚Äù his tone much lighter than it had been at the start of the conversation.  When we reach the shop the guys leer out the window for any sign of distress on my part and I wave them all off. The smell of product Barbasol and Dozer‚Äôs burnt coffee swirl in the air but at least the cool breeze from the river is doing something for the heat.  Bruce apologizes again and shakes my hand rather officially in view of his jury.  An idea sparks in my mind when he turns to leave. ‚ÄúQuestion for you.‚Äù  ‚ÄúShoot.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhen you were in Paris on your ‚Äòsojourn‚Äô‚Äù I add finger quotes in the air ‚ÄúDid you meet Lucius Fox?‚Äù  Bruce‚Äôs eyes shift from side to side and he takes a step back towards me. ‚ÄúI did. He‚Äôd worked for my father at one point I just happened to be in the right place at the right time and stopped a mugging. I try to be a good upstanding citizen when I can be. Why?‚Äù  ‚ÄúSomething for you to think about later I suppose.‚Äù  There is a small hum that rattles in his chest paired with a knowing nod before he turns on his heel and heads for his car. ‚ÄúAlfred expects you for dinner after work this evening. I‚Äôll inform him that you‚Äôre coming.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù  Cujo watches from the doorway as Bruce slides into his car and drives off. When I turn to look at him there‚Äôs an air of skepticism about him and I can‚Äôt help but wonder how his intuition must be going off like an alarm bell.  ‚ÄúHe apologize enough?‚Äù  Crossing the threshold and heading to the coffee pot I dump its burnt contents and begin making a new half pot to get us through the afternoon.  ‚ÄúYeah Cujo he did. He might be a pansy-ass bitch but he‚Äôs not heartless.‚Äù  Irish points his clippers at me and waves them in the air ‚ÄúHe messes with you like that again he has us to answer to. I‚Äôll burn his house down. On God.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll come to that‚Äù I try and pacify them with my charm and easy smile. ‚ÄúWe talked out our issue like adults and know where each other stands on it‚Ä¶not that we won‚Äôt potentially argue in the future but you know‚Ä¶‚Äù  Jax jabs an elbow into Dozer‚Äôs side and snickers ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it like being one of us and a friend of Bruce Wayne‚Äôs?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Cujo leans forward on the counter listening intently.  ‚ÄúAll I mean is that dude‚Äôs richer than God right? And I ain‚Äôt ever seen a single tabloid where he‚Äôs got a circle of friends around him like us ya know? But then Chase winds up in Gotham and now Wayne‚Äôs nearly a regular down at the shop checking in on her.  ‚ÄúEither that or he thinks she‚Äôs fine as hell.‚Äù  Dozer shoves Jax playfully across the room the shop erupting into a roar of laughter. I wipe tears from the corners of my eyes wheezing and sputtering while I try to regain some semblance of control over this conversation.  ‚ÄúWell God knows if I wasn‚Äôt going to go on a date with Dozer after he so valiantly saved my life Wayne‚Äôs not got a chance.  ‚ÄúBesides he‚Äôs not that bad honestly. Imagine growing up and having to second guess every single interaction and friendship you had because you had money status or the Wayne name. How many people tried to take advantage of that after his parents died you think? If anything he probably appreciates the fact I‚Äôm honest and call him out on his bullshit.‚Äù  ‚ÄúGirl where were you when we were growin‚Äô up‚Äù Irish hollers from his chair. ‚ÄúCan you imagine how much trouble we wouldn‚Äôt have gotten in to had she been around? Damn.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat or we woulda just ignored her and done it anyway‚Äù Jax laughs and dabs up Irish.  Cujo shakes his head and pours himself a coffee. ‚ÄúNah. The way y‚Äôall wrapped around her finger now? You‚Äôda been done for when we were young. Woulda done anything she wanted. You woulda been a bunch of choir boys and I wouldn‚Äôt have had to bail your asses out of so much of that hood shit.  ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs more than meets the eye with Chase boys. Probably always will be. A lady of mystery. Our lady of mystery.‚Äù  I pour my own cup of coffee and clink it off of Cujo‚Äôs with a smile ‚ÄúI‚Äôll drink to that.‚Äù,2024-07-12 00:56:31 GMT

Two words: Batfam Newsies AU.  I was struck with it halfway through watching a live production of the Broadway version (amazing) but it would probably be more based on the 1992 movie (childhood favorite I know it better. As in I can quote it all to you.)  So hear me out- I think Jason as Jack Kelly. In 92sies Jack Kelly is a fake name so his real name revealed at the end can be ‚ú®Jason Peter Todd‚ú®! But like grew up on the streets no living family watches out for the younger/newer kids frustrated with the system. For him I think Santa Fe would be a lot more metaphorical since I can‚Äôt picture him wanting to leave Gotham but Santa Fe (the song) just is Jason you can‚Äôt tell me otherwise.   Tim as Crutchy and here‚Äôs where more of the Broadway comes in because I love their sibling dynamic in it and it‚Äôs a little less so in 92sies. Still there but not as much. The live show I saw had a younger girl as Crutchy and their dynamic was just amazingggg. Anyway. Maybe he ran away maybe his parents died early maybe they just ditched him whatever. He does this now.   Dick as Davey Damian as Les. Now their personalities don‚Äôt match up quiiiite as well but I think it could be done. If Dami‚Äôs a little younger perhaps. I‚Äôm thinking Dick got shuttled into the orphanage and met Dami and bc it‚Äôs still Gotham the orphanage sucks and they‚Äôre supposed to go make money or whatever. I dunno that‚Äôs the tricky bit.   We can keep Snyder Medda (unless you wanted to put Selina there but I don‚Äôt really see it.) the Delanceys and Weasel and the rest of the gang of newsies as is unless anyone has suggestions for them. I‚Äôm all ears!  I‚Äôd go by the movie for this and have Clark Kent be Bryan Denton the reporter mostly because I can‚Äôt really think of anyone to fit the role of Katherine and definitely not someone I‚Äôd ship with Jason. Plus then Pulitzer can be Lex Luthor and that‚Äôs amazing to me lol.   And finally Bruce as Governor of New York Gotham Teddy Roosevelt! I‚Äôd definitely have him play a larger role. You have Jason/Jack hitching a ride on his carriage from the Refuge and then maybe trying to steal his tires or something later on they talk blah blah blah strike stuff.   Of course at the end of the strike and all the brothers are closer than ever and the nice old Governor is like ‚Äúmine‚Äù   I don‚Äôt know if this is even coherent but please feel free to add your ideas!!

One of the things that makes Bill Finger Jerry Robinson and Bob Kane‚Äôs Joker character so chaotic is the mystery behind him not knowing for certain much of his background. Although modern DC comic books showcase his most accepted origin story in Alan Moore‚Äôs 1988 one shot ‚ÄúBatman: The Killing Joke‚Äù as Joker says in the graphic novel ‚ÄúSometimes I remember it one way sometimes another‚Ä¶ If I‚Äôm going to have a past I prefer it to be multiple choice!‚Äù. In 1976 however DC released a super calendar filled with birthdays and important events for most if not all of the DC Multiverse including facts about the Clown Prince of Crime. One being that on this day in 1951 dressed as the Red Hood he escapes the Batman by diving into a chemical waste vat emerging with white skin and green hair forever transformed into The Joker.

Always add about 5 inches to both measurements so you have plenty of space around your piece. You don‚Äôt want the fabric to unravel and ruin your project. You can cut the fabric down after you‚Äôre done if you don‚Äôt like having a lot of excess.

My instructions inside it are meant for working with it inside Microsoft Excel I have no idea how to use google sheets so I can‚Äôt help you there. You can download the file from this link and then open it up in Excel.   Loading Google Sheets  Also in the excel file I have four workbooks. The first is the chart with a grid broken into the 20 panels I used to make the PDF. The second is the high contrast chart without a grid the third is the graph in the colors of the suggested thread and the fourth is all the thread information.   If anyone ends up making this I would LOVE to see process pictures! I started mine yesterday and I‚Äôm so excited about it.

Both as Green Lantern and just in general. But he tries to hide it but he Def draws small drawings of both batman and green lantern together or as Bruce and Hal. I don‚Äôt make the rules:)  ‚òÜ Bruce doesn‚Äôt tell anyone about his regression. ANYONE. He does hide it pretty well when he‚Äôs in a different headspace but him in little headspace?

AT ALL. Even if he knows they‚Äôd be supportive and even help him get through it.  ‚ô§ One day Bruce finds him absolutely BAWLING like this and not knowing what to do he brings him a soft medium-large sized deer plush (that definitely wasn‚Äôt one of the toys Diana bought and mysteriously went missing and definitely ISNT one of Bruce‚Äôs favorite pushes bc it reminds him of Hal) and gives it to him to hug.   ‚óÜ This works really well and allows for Hal to quiet down a bit and tell Bruce that he doesn‚Äôt wanna tell him what‚Äôs going on (yet) but thanks him and Bruce stays with him while he‚Äôs still softly sobbing and hiccuping while holding him. (Bruce Def knows that he‚Äôs little now too though so)  ‚ô•Ô∏é Clark is very understanding about it and even can kind of tell when any of them regress Barry is more open about it but Clark can notice he‚Äôs little even before Barry can.

Gnawed on until they‚Äôre litterally sharpened a bit. His suit? Holes in the neck part now. Batmans cowl? Teeth marks on the rubber bat ears. Anything and everything is free game. Once he tried to chew the lasso of truth and Diana had to get him a chewy turns out those don‚Äôt last long so Bruce bought him a whole pack.  ‚ñ† whenever hal does go to someone when hes feeling little he goes to Bruce or Clark but he only goes to Clark if it‚Äôs dire and Bruce isn‚Äôt there.

The room he was in was small and white and bright and that was it. That was where he stayed ‚Äì a small white bright room. Chained to the floor by chains so big they were probably partly for show. Wearing a white jumpsuit from head to toe with no socks or shoes and no color.  He got food once in the morning; a beige slop and a spoon. He got food once in the evening usually something a little better like soup. In midday he was released from the chains to move across the white room toward the white door to use the white bathroom. Every other waking moment he was chained and if he wasn‚Äôt chained to the floor he was being dragged along in slightly more bearable shackles by a person dressed in white through hallways that were‚Ä¶ well. The same as everything else.   White.  If you couldn‚Äôt tell his life was pretty riveting.  The eleven-year-old had been in the white place for well over four years now. He was pretty sure if he were put back into the real world he would have a brain aneurism from the sheer amount of stimuli around him. Nothing ever happened there. Rockie stared at white day in and day out reveling in the moments where he had some sort of interaction with objects whether that be his soup bowl the toilet his shackles being swapped the change in scenery from one white room to another. It was about all he could do to keep himself sane ‚Äì focus on the little things he got to touch and see and smell and hear.  He was pretty sure stimulation had something to do with child development but he didn‚Äôt seem to be malfunctioning yet.  That is if you didn‚Äôt count the fact that he could siphon superpowers out of people like a human vacuum cleaner.  To his understanding that seemed to be his primary purpose in life ‚Äì taking other people‚Äôs superpowers. It was what the white-clothes people used him for.  With a soft sigh Rockie sat down on the white floor dragging his shackles around to make the soft scraping sound of metal against metal. It was his favorite sound ‚Äì except sometimes when they brought him a glass bowl for dinner he liked to ding his spoon against that. It sounded kind of like bells‚Ä¶ or what he imagined bells to sound like anyway. He didn‚Äôt quite remember the real deal. Although he did remember going to church on Sundays and hearing the loud bells at noon the kind of low sound that rattled his teeth but those were the wrong kind of bells; his bowl sounded more like sleigh bells or a service bell on a desk somewhere.  He wished he had one of those desk bells. It‚Äôd be much more interesting than chains and a white floor.  He lifted his arms and dropped them slowly creating a repetitive clack-clack-clack-clack of each metal link hitting the floor. He wasn‚Äôt sure he could make any new sounds with his chains ‚Äì he‚Äôd been locked up for so long he was pretty sure he‚Äôd exhausted them all. He wished he could hear more.  After a while of the clacking sound he grew tired of it so he laid down sprawled out in the middle of the floor for no apparent reason. His chains were anchored into the metal far from each other so he could really only move a few yards forward or backwards and maybe a foot to either side. He could only use both hands for things like eating if he sat dead-center in the room where the chains gave the most slack. That didn‚Äôt leave him very many options for exploring ‚Äì not that there was much to see in a room so white. (But still walking around would be kind of nice? For him walking in a simple circle sounded fun. Exciting even.)  His internal clock began to tick down and the realization that they would probably be coming to give him food soon surfaced in his mind. Maybe he could get them to talk to him. No one really ever did ‚Äì most of them ignored his statements or told him to stay quiet which was kind of annoying. Although he did appreciate them taking the time to say something even if it was shut up. The silent treatment was something he despised. He wanted to talk so bad. He wanted to interact with humans so bad. Why couldn‚Äôt he do that here? Why wasn‚Äôt he allowed to?  The white door opposite to the bathroom opened at least ten minutes too early which had Rockie sitting up from his spot.  A person in a solid white jumpsuit entered ‚Äì it was an older man. Rockie didn‚Äôt know his name he was never told what it was though he did know this was the man responsible for bringing him meals. (It was a woman who unchained him for the bathroom ‚Äì he didn‚Äôt like her. Her hair stuck up too much to be normal. Not that he knew too awfully much about normalcy.)  He watched as the man entered with no tray of food but his hands hidden behind‚Äôs back instead. Rockie‚Äôs eyes traveled warily with him. They‚Äôd never hurt Rockie there (which was good because the white was torture enough.) but if he didn‚Äôt have something bad why were his hands hidden?  Rockie found himself sliding backwards on the familiar man‚Äôs approach.  ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù The man ordered holding a delicate hand in Rockie‚Äôs direction the other staying out of sight. His icy blue eyes were glimmering with something like joy like happiness. He crouched down in front of the child with a small smile tugging at his mouth; a smile! Rock never really saw people smile and at the simple expression he felt one forming on his face too though he didn‚Äôt know why. Humans were so fluid so exciting so contagious.  He wished he saw more humans.  ‚ÄúI have a gift for you‚Äù The man started slowly his smile only growing glimmer in his eyes brightening like he were talking to some kind of dog he was about to treat. Rockie tilted his head to one side in question ‚Äì adding more to the dog theory when he really thought about it.  ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù The child questioned craning his neck in an attempt to get a view behind the man‚Äôs back. He moved so Rockie couldn‚Äôt see. ‚ÄúA good one? You look happy.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYes a good one‚Äù He replied. ‚ÄúJust for you from my office.‚Äù  Rockie leaned to one side again trying to get a view of it. ‚ÄúCan I see?‚Äù  In one swift exciting motion the food-man brought his other hand forward revealing probably the most peculiar thing Rockie had seen in a long long time. It was a little cube. On each side of the cube were nine little squares all different colors. More colors than he‚Äôd seen in forever ‚Äì red and blue and yellow and green and orange and of course white.  The sight of the little thing alone was enough to make Rockie‚Äôs face split into a wide grin his fingers twitching in anticipation like a bull ready to run. ‚ÄúCan I touch it?‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis is called a Rubik‚Äôs cube. It‚Äôs a handheld puzzle‚Äù The man explained. He then took the cube in both hands and began to turn it one piece at a time shifting where the colors were on the outside. ‚ÄúThe goal is to get all the green squares on one side all the red on another and the blue and so on to make it a uniform cube with only one color on every side.‚Äù  Rockie‚Äôs eyes moved with him as the man worked the puzzle turning and twisting it swapping the colors out.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never solved one myself‚Äù He continued setting the cube on the floor a taunting distance away as Rockie couldn‚Äôt reach it with his shackles. ‚ÄúThis is yours now. But only if you do something for me first.‚Äù  The child nodded readily eyes still trained on the little most-colorful-thing-he‚Äôd-ever-seen-ever.  ‚ÄúI am going to unchain you and take you to the siphon room. There are many patients in there for you today so you might feel a little tired afterwards‚Äù The man smiled. ‚ÄúJust remember that you are doing something good for them‚Ä¶ making a difference in their lives so that they can live it normal and free beyond walls like these.‚Äù  Rockie nodded but kept looking at the cube. ‚ÄúSometimes I wish I could take my own superpowers away.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNone of that now‚Äù The man frowned. ‚ÄúYour powers have a purpose. You‚Äôre changing lives. Saving them.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut what if they wanted to keep their powers?‚Äù The boy asked his eyes flicking up to the man in the room. Something in the air seemed to change something on his face shifted.  ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt‚Äù He answered curtly. ‚ÄúMetahumans are abominations that need to be destroyed.‚Äù  Rockie blinked once twice and then looked down at the white floor.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre keeping them from that fate. You‚Äôre turning them back into normal people. Giving their lives back‚Äù  A moment of silence passed and the child tapped one finger on the floor. ‚ÄúDo I need to be destroyed?‚Äù  A beat passed.  ‚ÄúYes. But not until your time of saving is done‚Äù The man replied. He reached down and with a key he pulled from a pocket when Rockie wasn‚Äôt looking unlocked his shackles. ‚ÄúNow come on; let‚Äôs go set some people free shall we? I‚Äôll even let you walk without chains this time.‚Äù  Rockie with one last look at the little cube followed the man out of the room.  White halls and a few moments of quiet and they were in the siphon room. It was just like Rockie‚Äôs white a bland except it had a dozen big metal chairs spaced out in it for people who didn‚Äôt want to cooperate with metal clasps that held them down. Currently they were all full of writhing patients.  The siphon room had some kind of technology in the walls that kept metahumans from using their powers within ‚Äì Rockie wasn‚Äôt quite sure about it really but he knew the technology was from a man named Dr. Keene who had delightedly used him as a test subject for the technology once. It hadn‚Äôt been terrible he was simply asked to siphon over and over and over again until the science man got it right and Rockie couldn‚Äôt siphon anymore. But something about him had been strange‚Ä¶ heavy dark. Like he made the air thick around him when he moved like he had a storm cloud that went with him everywhere.  Rockie only saw him once more after that when he was given a new jumpsuit that supposedly would let him use his powers within the walls while the others couldn‚Äôt. (Newsflash; it worked. Which was why he was still having to do his job today.)  ‚ÄúTake your pick of where to start do them all‚Äù The man ordered propping himself up near the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right here if you need me.‚Äù  Rockie nodded once glancing at the dozen people in the room. Most were children his age or younger but a few were teenagers and he spied one adult in the back corner too all with a single sleeve rolled up. They were trying to break out of the clasps that held them to the chairs some of the kids crying some of the older ones growling about police and lawyers and stuff ‚Äì Rockie didn‚Äôt really know what it all meant. Instead of dwelling on it he thought about his cube and he dutifully chose who to start with: a boy in the front row whose eyes were glowing a strange shade of magenta.  He was silent as Rockie approached his magenta eyes following him all the way. He didn‚Äôt seem that much older than Rockie actually. He might‚Äôve been a couple years older with blonde hair that stuck out like a sore thumb in the room. He squirmed lightly the closer he got.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry I don‚Äôt think it hurts‚Äù Rockie muttered. ‚ÄúIt only takes a second.‚Äù  The boy scowled at him. ‚ÄúMy parents didn‚Äôt even ask if I wanted to keep them they just sent me here.‚Äù  Rockie could‚Äôve paused but he didn‚Äôt decide he needed to. He could‚Äôve asked the boy a bazillion questions but he didn‚Äôt decide he needed to do that either. So instead he reached out and gently touched the boy‚Äôs exposed arm forcing the previous statement out of his mind. It wasn‚Äôt his to dwell on.  His hand began to glow and with a sudden wave of cold and weightlessness that entered his body Rockie exhaled. He could feel something strange moving through his veins and one second after he was cold he was so so hot. He felt the tips of his toes leave the cool metal floor and the crawling in his veins continued even as he released the other boy‚Äôs arm.  He grimaced as the feeling became progressively more like snakes under his skin ‚Äì whole snakes like pythons or whatever the biggest possible ones were curling around his organs making it hard to think hard to breathe hard to feel. He peeled his eyes open and he was hovering a few feet off of the floor. All of the fire and cold and snakes seemed to pool in his left hand until it spilled out in a violent burning sensation arcs of loud striking electricity erupting from his fingertips like a firework show with loud cracks! and bangs! The lightning wound up his left arm like a serpent moving from there to his head then his other arm his torso and legs cracking and striking him painfully what seemed like a billion times a second. It felt like he was on fire like he was being stabbed by a trillion knives ‚Äì it was a pain so intense he couldn‚Äôt even make himself react. Bolts of lightning were shooting out from him like he was a storm cloud a human piece of dynamite.  And suddenly it stopped.  His bare feet hit the floor and he stumbled breaths bated like he‚Äôd run a marathon. His whole entire body seemed to be buzzing like he was filled with a million bees all trying to break out at once the screaming searing pain fading to an occasional full body jolt of something fiery.  The boy in the chair hadn‚Äôt moved an inch but his scowl was deeper now.  ‚ÄúLooks like it hurt you way more than it hurt me. Have fun being electrocuted asshole‚Äù  Rockie with a grimace at the strange electricity buzzing through his entire body glanced back at the food man who nodded for him to continue.  He glanced back at the room at all the eyes that were now on him. Eleven to go.  He was unconscious by the fourth. (And once he woke up he kept going as he was told. One of them had the power of death. That went about as well as you could imagine.)  The Rubik‚Äôs cube was waiting on him in his room when he returned even though he wasn‚Äôt conscious to see it.  ‚Äî  dedicated to @sassenashsworld‚ù§Ô∏è  ‚Äî tag list!

15,Batman,['dc agere'  'sfw agere'  'dcu'  'green lantern'  'the flash'  'superman'  'wonder woman'],unluckystarboy,Ik @cutiecorner hasn‚Äôt been feeling that great lately so I thought I‚Äôd share some headcannons for them (and if ppl just wanna see headcannons as well lol)  These are going to be agere headcannons and are going to be a mix of like just random dc characters but mainly centered around the bats :)  _______________________  ‚ô° Bruce and Hal may squabble a bit when in costume and stuff and may fight but little Bruce absolutely ADORES Hal. Both as Green Lantern and just in general. But he tries to hide it but he Def draws small drawings of both batman and green lantern together or as Bruce and Hal. I don‚Äôt make the rules:)  ‚òÜ Bruce doesn‚Äôt tell anyone about his regression. ANYONE. He does hide it pretty well when he‚Äôs in a different headspace but him in little headspace? It‚Äôs fair game. He‚Äôd likely be a bit easier to read and less careful with things like he is usually.   ‚ôß The only people in the JL that do know about it is likely Wonder Woman Green Lantern (Hal Jordan AND John (*quick side note I hope that‚Äôs the other gls name bc I did forget) Superman was the last one to officially find out just from observing things and a quick Google search.   ‚òÖ Barry also regresses but to the age that around his mom died  ‚ô•Ô∏é Bruce usually is around 1-3 years but goes higher if he‚Äôs not AS stressed or if it‚Äôs just cause he‚Äôs extremely happy and comfortable  ‚ô£Ô∏é Diana Def bought some plushies for the two of them but says it‚Äôs just staying at the watch tower until she can find a place for them but somehow magically they go missing within an hour of being there‚Ä¶.strange‚Ä¶.  ‚óá Hal is actually a switch he doesn‚Äôt regress much but when he does its likely triggered by something negative he doesn‚Äôt tell anyone about it. AT ALL. Even if he knows they‚Äôd be supportive and even help him get through it.  ‚ô§ One day Bruce finds him absolutely BAWLING like this and not knowing what to do he brings him a soft medium-large sized deer plush (that definitely wasn‚Äôt one of the toys Diana bought and mysteriously went missing and definitely ISNT one of Bruce‚Äôs favorite pushes bc it reminds him of Hal) and gives it to him to hug.   ‚óÜ This works really well and allows for Hal to quiet down a bit and tell Bruce that he doesn‚Äôt wanna tell him what‚Äôs going on (yet) but thanks him and Bruce stays with him while he‚Äôs still softly sobbing and hiccuping while holding him. (Bruce Def knows that he‚Äôs little now too though so)  ‚ô•Ô∏é Clark is very understanding about it and even can kind of tell when any of them regress Barry is more open about it but Clark can notice he‚Äôs little even before Barry can. He Def tells little Bruce a bunch of facts about the farm animals and machinery. He also kind of picks up that Hal MIGHT be little at times but doesn‚Äôt push it. He does let Hal tell him about planes and flying when he seems like he is and for once is very excited.  ‚ô†Ô∏é The one time that Bruce and Hal both trigger each other‚Äôs regression by accident from arguing they end up needing to take a break from each other for a while but eventually Hal shows up to Bruce‚Äôs door with the deer that Bruce let him borrow in hand an a reddened face from crying. They both apologize in their own way and go watch their favorite cartoons together! (Both older and modern)  ‚ñ° Little Barry likes to chew stuff like everything and anything. His straw on his cups? Gnawed on until they‚Äôre litterally sharpened a bit. His suit? Holes in the neck part now. Batmans cowl? Teeth marks on the rubber bat ears. Anything and everything is free game. Once he tried to chew the lasso of truth and Diana had to get him a chewy turns out those don‚Äôt last long so Bruce bought him a whole pack.  ‚ñ† whenever hal does go to someone when hes feeling little he goes to Bruce or Clark but he only goes to Clark if it‚Äôs dire and Bruce isn‚Äôt there. He doesn‚Äôt even know that Bruce knows yet he just goes and watches cartoons with him or if shes too overwhelmed she‚Äôll just stay with him and relax a but.  ~I also headcannon that Hal goes by Both He/Him and She/Her pronouns btw  ‚òÜBarry does end up getting a pacifier and tried his best to take MUCH better care of that than his chewies that he takes about everywhere and gnaws on. He saves it for when he‚Äôs calm enough to not chew it as badly.  ‚ô° Bruce mainly has the plushies that Diana bought for him and a few childhood toys that Clark claims that he only brought to the tower for sentimental purposes..although he hasn‚Äôt complained when his old plush cow went missing..he doesn‚Äôt care though he DOES hide them in his room in the tower and doesn‚Äôt take them back to the manor. Well unless they somehow magically make it back with him.   ‚ôß Hal sometimes drops plushes off at the manor along with Clark and Diana. Alfred is aware of this and supports it. Anything that‚Äôll help his son.  ‚òÖ Hal sometimes draws pictures of the whole league and himself and keeps them in a notebook in a drawer in her room in the tower  ‚ô•Ô∏é She Def draws with Barry and Clark sometimes when she‚Äôs bored  Anyways I hope you enjoyed these and I hope they were okay lol :),2024-07-12 05:42:18 GMT

But with platonic omegaverse and dragons. Gotham? Already cursed to hell and back. But then another curse was formed via the museum bringing in this strange statue. That of course got stolen because solid crystal and gold. Then got broken split in half. And oop.  New Curse.   Now before I get into the curse lemme explain the omegaverse side of things. Everyone is born a secondary gender labeled Alpha Omega or Beta. There‚Äôs also medical conditions where one is neither usually a mix of genetic and hormonal issues. Gotham however is Weird. They have no set scent according to Outsiders. Really? They can shift and switch (Yes there‚Äôs a large LGTBQ percentage in the population) at will. It can take months for someone new to the city but those that have been there for a few generations can do it in hours. For those like the Waynes or other founders who have been there since the beginning of the city? Minutes.  It‚Äôs more than a little unnerving to Outsiders who are used to things staying the same.   But that curse (or blessing as others call it) mixed with the new dragon one. See they can all change into draconic form and do their best to keep that secret. But they also have different forms depending on the secondary sex they are at that time.      &lt;!-- more --&gt; @f4nd0m-fun &amp; @golden-buddle idk if u‚Äôd be interested in this but-,2024-07-12 08:29:43 GMT

The room he was in was small and white and bright and that was it. That was where he stayed ‚Äì a small white bright room. Chained to the floor by chains so big they were probably partly for show. Wearing a white jumpsuit from head to toe with no socks or shoes and no color.  He got food once in the morning; a beige slop and a spoon. He got food once in the evening usually something a little better like soup. In midday he was released from the chains to move across the white room toward the white door to use the white bathroom. Every other waking moment he was chained and if he wasn‚Äôt chained to the floor he was being dragged along in slightly more bearable shackles by a person dressed in white through hallways that were‚Ä¶ well. The same as everything else.   White.  If you couldn‚Äôt tell his life was pretty riveting.  The eleven-year-old had been in the white place for well over four years now. He was pretty sure if he were put back into the real world he would have a brain aneurism from the sheer amount of stimuli around him. Nothing ever happened there. Rockie stared at white day in and day out reveling in the moments where he had some sort of interaction with objects whether that be his soup bowl the toilet his shackles being swapped the change in scenery from one white room to another. It was about all he could do to keep himself sane ‚Äì focus on the little things he got to touch and see and smell and hear.  He was pretty sure stimulation had something to do with child development but he didn‚Äôt seem to be malfunctioning yet.  That is if you didn‚Äôt count the fact that he could siphon superpowers out of people like a human vacuum cleaner.  To his understanding that seemed to be his primary purpose in life ‚Äì taking other people‚Äôs superpowers. It was what the white-clothes people used him for.  With a soft sigh Rockie sat down on the white floor dragging his shackles around to make the soft scraping sound of metal against metal. It was his favorite sound ‚Äì except sometimes when they brought him a glass bowl for dinner he liked to ding his spoon against that. It sounded kind of like bells‚Ä¶ or what he imagined bells to sound like anyway. He didn‚Äôt quite remember the real deal. Although he did remember going to church on Sundays and hearing the loud bells at noon the kind of low sound that rattled his teeth but those were the wrong kind of bells; his bowl sounded more like sleigh bells or a service bell on a desk somewhere.  He wished he had one of those desk bells. It‚Äôd be much more interesting than chains and a white floor.  He lifted his arms and dropped them slowly creating a repetitive clack-clack-clack-clack of each metal link hitting the floor. He wasn‚Äôt sure he could make any new sounds with his chains ‚Äì he‚Äôd been locked up for so long he was pretty sure he‚Äôd exhausted them all. He wished he could hear more.  After a while of the clacking sound he grew tired of it so he laid down sprawled out in the middle of the floor for no apparent reason. His chains were anchored into the metal far from each other so he could really only move a few yards forward or backwards and maybe a foot to either side. He could only use both hands for things like eating if he sat dead-center in the room where the chains gave the most slack. That didn‚Äôt leave him very many options for exploring ‚Äì not that there was much to see in a room so white. (But still walking around would be kind of nice? For him walking in a simple circle sounded fun. Exciting even.)  His internal clock began to tick down and the realization that they would probably be coming to give him food soon surfaced in his mind. Maybe he could get them to talk to him. No one really ever did ‚Äì most of them ignored his statements or told him to stay quiet which was kind of annoying. Although he did appreciate them taking the time to say something even if it was shut up. The silent treatment was something he despised. He wanted to talk so bad. He wanted to interact with humans so bad. Why couldn‚Äôt he do that here? Why wasn‚Äôt he allowed to?  The white door opposite to the bathroom opened at least ten minutes too early which had Rockie sitting up from his spot.  A person in a solid white jumpsuit entered ‚Äì it was an older man. Rockie didn‚Äôt know his name he was never told what it was though he did know this was the man responsible for bringing him meals. (It was a woman who unchained him for the bathroom ‚Äì he didn‚Äôt like her. Her hair stuck up too much to be normal. Not that he knew too awfully much about normalcy.)  He watched as the man entered with no tray of food but his hands hidden behind‚Äôs back instead. Rockie‚Äôs eyes traveled warily with him. They‚Äôd never hurt Rockie there (which was good because the white was torture enough.) but if he didn‚Äôt have something bad why were his hands hidden?  Rockie found himself sliding backwards on the familiar man‚Äôs approach.  ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù The man ordered holding a delicate hand in Rockie‚Äôs direction the other staying out of sight. His icy blue eyes were glimmering with something like joy like happiness. He crouched down in front of the child with a small smile tugging at his mouth; a smile! Rock never really saw people smile and at the simple expression he felt one forming on his face too though he didn‚Äôt know why. Humans were so fluid so exciting so contagious.  He wished he saw more humans.  ‚ÄúI have a gift for you‚Äù The man started slowly his smile only growing glimmer in his eyes brightening like he were talking to some kind of dog he was about to treat. Rockie tilted his head to one side in question ‚Äì adding more to the dog theory when he really thought about it.  ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù The child questioned craning his neck in an attempt to get a view behind the man‚Äôs back. He moved so Rockie couldn‚Äôt see. ‚ÄúA good one? You look happy.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYes a good one‚Äù He replied. ‚ÄúJust for you from my office.‚Äù  Rockie leaned to one side again trying to get a view of it. ‚ÄúCan I see?‚Äù  In one swift exciting motion the food-man brought his other hand forward revealing probably the most peculiar thing Rockie had seen in a long long time. It was a little cube. On each side of the cube were nine little squares all different colors. More colors than he‚Äôd seen in forever ‚Äì red and blue and yellow and green and orange and of course white.  The sight of the little thing alone was enough to make Rockie‚Äôs face split into a wide grin his fingers twitching in anticipation like a bull ready to run. ‚ÄúCan I touch it?‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis is called a Rubik‚Äôs cube. It‚Äôs a handheld puzzle‚Äù The man explained. He then took the cube in both hands and began to turn it one piece at a time shifting where the colors were on the outside. ‚ÄúThe goal is to get all the green squares on one side all the red on another and the blue and so on to make it a uniform cube with only one color on every side.‚Äù  Rockie‚Äôs eyes moved with him as the man worked the puzzle turning and twisting it swapping the colors out.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never solved one myself‚Äù He continued setting the cube on the floor a taunting distance away as Rockie couldn‚Äôt reach it with his shackles. ‚ÄúThis is yours now. But only if you do something for me first.‚Äù  The child nodded readily eyes still trained on the little most-colorful-thing-he‚Äôd-ever-seen-ever.  ‚ÄúI am going to unchain you and take you to the siphon room. There are many patients in there for you today so you might feel a little tired afterwards‚Äù The man smiled. ‚ÄúJust remember that you are doing something good for them‚Ä¶ making a difference in their lives so that they can live it normal and free beyond walls like these.‚Äù  Rockie nodded but kept looking at the cube. ‚ÄúSometimes I wish I could take my own superpowers away.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNone of that now‚Äù The man frowned. ‚ÄúYour powers have a purpose. You‚Äôre changing lives. Saving them.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut what if they wanted to keep their powers?‚Äù The boy asked his eyes flicking up to the man in the room. Something in the air seemed to change something on his face shifted.  ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt‚Äù He answered curtly. ‚ÄúMetahumans are abominations that need to be destroyed.‚Äù  Rockie blinked once twice and then looked down at the white floor.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre keeping them from that fate. You‚Äôre turning them back into normal people. Giving their lives back‚Äù  A moment of silence passed and the child tapped one finger on the floor. ‚ÄúDo I need to be destroyed?‚Äù  A beat passed.  ‚ÄúYes. But not until your time of saving is done‚Äù The man replied. He reached down and with a key he pulled from a pocket when Rockie wasn‚Äôt looking unlocked his shackles. ‚ÄúNow come on; let‚Äôs go set some people free shall we? I‚Äôll even let you walk without chains this time.‚Äù  Rockie with one last look at the little cube followed the man out of the room.  White halls and a few moments of quiet and they were in the siphon room. It was just like Rockie‚Äôs white a bland except it had a dozen big metal chairs spaced out in it for people who didn‚Äôt want to cooperate with metal clasps that held them down. Currently they were all full of writhing patients.  The siphon room had some kind of technology in the walls that kept metahumans from using their powers within ‚Äì Rockie wasn‚Äôt quite sure about it really but he knew the technology was from a man named Dr. Keene who had delightedly used him as a test subject for the technology once. It hadn‚Äôt been terrible he was simply asked to siphon over and over and over again until the science man got it right and Rockie couldn‚Äôt siphon anymore. But something about him had been strange‚Ä¶ heavy dark. Like he made the air thick around him when he moved like he had a storm cloud that went with him everywhere.  Rockie only saw him once more after that when he was given a new jumpsuit that supposedly would let him use his powers within the walls while the others couldn‚Äôt. (Newsflash; it worked. Which was why he was still having to do his job today.)  ‚ÄúTake your pick of where to start do them all‚Äù The man ordered propping himself up near the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right here if you need me.‚Äù  Rockie nodded once glancing at the dozen people in the room. Most were children his age or younger but a few were teenagers and he spied one adult in the back corner too all with a single sleeve rolled up. They were trying to break out of the clasps that held them to the chairs some of the kids crying some of the older ones growling about police and lawyers and stuff ‚Äì Rockie didn‚Äôt really know what it all meant. Instead of dwelling on it he thought about his cube and he dutifully chose who to start with: a boy in the front row whose eyes were glowing a strange shade of magenta.  He was silent as Rockie approached his magenta eyes following him all the way. He didn‚Äôt seem that much older than Rockie actually. He might‚Äôve been a couple years older with blonde hair that stuck out like a sore thumb in the room. He squirmed lightly the closer he got.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry I don‚Äôt think it hurts‚Äù Rockie muttered. ‚ÄúIt only takes a second.‚Äù  The boy scowled at him. ‚ÄúMy parents didn‚Äôt even ask if I wanted to keep them they just sent me here.‚Äù  Rockie could‚Äôve paused but he didn‚Äôt decide he needed to. He could‚Äôve asked the boy a bazillion questions but he didn‚Äôt decide he needed to do that either. So instead he reached out and gently touched the boy‚Äôs exposed arm forcing the previous statement out of his mind. It wasn‚Äôt his to dwell on.  His hand began to glow and with a sudden wave of cold and weightlessness that entered his body Rockie exhaled. He could feel something strange moving through his veins and one second after he was cold he was so so hot. He felt the tips of his toes leave the cool metal floor and the crawling in his veins continued even as he released the other boy‚Äôs arm.  He grimaced as the feeling became progressively more like snakes under his skin ‚Äì whole snakes like pythons or whatever the biggest possible ones were curling around his organs making it hard to think hard to breathe hard to feel. He peeled his eyes open and he was hovering a few feet off of the floor. All of the fire and cold and snakes seemed to pool in his left hand until it spilled out in a violent burning sensation arcs of loud striking electricity erupting from his fingertips like a firework show with loud cracks! and bangs! The lightning wound up his left arm like a serpent moving from there to his head then his other arm his torso and legs cracking and striking him painfully what seemed like a billion times a second. It felt like he was on fire like he was being stabbed by a trillion knives ‚Äì it was a pain so intense he couldn‚Äôt even make himself react. Bolts of lightning were shooting out from him like he was a storm cloud a human piece of dynamite.  And suddenly it stopped.  His bare feet hit the floor and he stumbled breaths bated like he‚Äôd run a marathon. His whole entire body seemed to be buzzing like he was filled with a million bees all trying to break out at once the screaming searing pain fading to an occasional full body jolt of something fiery.  The boy in the chair hadn‚Äôt moved an inch but his scowl was deeper now.  ‚ÄúLooks like it hurt you way more than it hurt me. Have fun being electrocuted asshole‚Äù  Rockie with a grimace at the strange electricity buzzing through his entire body glanced back at the food man who nodded for him to continue.  He glanced back at the room at all the eyes that were now on him. Eleven to go.  He was unconscious by the fourth. (And once he woke up he kept going as he was told. One of them had the power of death. That went about as well as you could imagine.)  The Rubik‚Äôs cube was waiting on him in his room when he returned even though he wasn‚Äôt conscious to see it.  ‚Äî  dedicated to @sassenashsworld‚ù§Ô∏è  ‚Äî tag list!

He can take care of himself!! and no ones helped him in his time of need afterall why else would he have ended up where he is?? Bruce further proving his point when he shows hes not qualified despite being the most qualified person there could possibly be AND-  And like dont even get me started on the meta aspects too like bruce reading into joker is probably what the reader does as well so when joker calls him out hes also targeting the reader‚Äì GAAAHH ITS TOO GOOD TO BE REAL  DRACZE THE THINGS YOU DO TO ME I SWEAR     Or at least thats how ive read things it might be wrong     Ive just always found interesting how autistic coding in these two is less talked about than queer coding when at least in my opinion they kinda go hand in hand‚Ä¶. i love how HWA deals with both      I feel so lucky this fic is real fr,2024-07-12 07:15:51 GMT

But with platonic omegaverse and dragons. Gotham? Already cursed to hell and back. But then another curse was formed via the museum bringing in this strange statue. That of course got stolen because solid crystal and gold. Then got broken split in half. And oop.  New Curse.   Now before I get into the curse lemme explain the omegaverse side of things. Everyone is born a secondary gender labeled Alpha Omega or Beta. There‚Äôs also medical conditions where one is neither usually a mix of genetic and hormonal issues. Gotham however is Weird. They have no set scent according to Outsiders. Really? They can shift and switch (Yes there‚Äôs a large LGTBQ percentage in the population) at will. It can take months for someone new to the city but those that have been there for a few generations can do it in hours. For those like the Waynes or other founders who have been there since the beginning of the city? Minutes.  It‚Äôs more than a little unnerving to Outsiders who are used to things staying the same.   But that curse (or blessing as others call it) mixed with the new dragon one. See they can all change into draconic form and do their best to keep that secret. But they also have different forms depending on the secondary sex they are at that time.      &lt;!-- more --&gt; @f4nd0m-fun &amp; @golden-buddle idk if u‚Äôd be interested in this but-,2024-07-12 08:29:43 GMT

But with platonic omegaverse and dragons. Gotham? Already cursed to hell and back. But then another curse was formed via the museum bringing in this strange statue. That of course got stolen because solid crystal and gold. Then got broken split in half. And oop.  New Curse.   Now before I get into the curse lemme explain the omegaverse side of things. Everyone is born a secondary gender labeled Alpha Omega or Beta. There‚Äôs also medical conditions where one is neither usually a mix of genetic and hormonal issues. Gotham however is Weird. They have no set scent according to Outsiders. Really? They can shift and switch (Yes there‚Äôs a large LGTBQ percentage in the population) at will. It can take months for someone new to the city but those that have been there for a few generations can do it in hours. For those like the Waynes or other founders who have been there since the beginning of the city? Minutes.  It‚Äôs more than a little unnerving to Outsiders who are used to things staying the same.   But that curse (or blessing as others call it) mixed with the new dragon one. See they can all change into draconic form and do their best to keep that secret. But they also have different forms depending on the secondary sex they are at that time.      &lt;!-- more --&gt; @f4nd0m-fun &amp; @golden-buddle idk if u‚Äôd be interested in this but-,2024-07-12 08:29:43 GMT

121,Batman,['dc'  'danny phantom'  'danny fenton'  'jason todd'  'dc x dp'],jasontoddspussy,DP x DC AU - Bodyswap by death  Saw this idea that I‚Äôd sorta forgotten about in my docs the other day. Basically Jason and Danny die at the same time or something. This could be when Jason y&#x27;know dies but Danny I believe was during a capture - I think my intention was that his parents had found out about Phantom and vivisected him however it killed him (like for real.) And they buried the body in secret out of ‚Äúrespect‚Äù.   Anyways when the punch to reality happens instead of Jay waking up in his grave.. He wakes up in Danny‚Äôs and vice-versa. The two of them switched bodies.  Danny-in-Jason‚Äôs body is confused and wanders around but is ultimately found. Maybe he‚Äôs a halfa-again (My Jason‚Äôs halfa design is very reminiscent of Ghost Rider tbh) and he ends up becoming a vigilante but ultimately he‚Äôs found by the bats and ‚Äúbrought home‚Äù - But Danny isn‚Äôt Jason.. However he was a scared and lonely kid. Who wanted a family. A family to love him and suddenly.. He can have that.   Meanwhile Jason is extremely confused and suspicious because like?? What.. The hell just happened? He‚Äôs in a different body (Although they look similar and based on what he was‚Ä¶ buried in he‚Äôs assuming they‚Äôre both transmasc as well which weird) and in a place he‚Äôs never been to much less heard of. But Jason‚Äôs a survivalist and he‚Äôs gonna figure out what‚Äôs going on and he‚Äôs going home.  (It gets messy when he finds out he‚Äôs not completely alive. It gets messier when he finds out this kid died unjustified and Jason wants to help he wants to let this kids ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù disappearance be uncovered but he‚Äôs still living with the fact he died. Living with the fact that he misses his family. He wants to go home)   I‚Äôm not sure where I was going with it but ultimately Danny pretends to be Jason and Jason is on his own trying to get home.  If this little idea inspires anyone to create something feel free to show me!!,2024-07-12 09:31:44 GMT

Spoiler and Trigger Warnings this book is intended for 18+ audiences only reader discretion is advised. Graphic depictions of violence gore self harm mental illness emotional abuse child abuse and adult situations are in this comic.  Not only is the artwork pure nightmare fuel.  If we take out the fact that the characters are the internationally beloved Batman and Joker it drops your expectations of what the story should be and conveys true horror. There‚Äôs this guy in an asylum who has stalked and harassed an orphaned billionaire for an over a decade now. The stalker is completely obsessed with the billionaire. His cell is filled with newspaper clippings magazine articles personal drawings and a weird shrine with a teddy bear covered in lipstick stains named after the billionaire that the stalker talks to and sleeps with at night. The stalker has concluded that the only reason his billionaire is ignoring him is because he is spending too much time with his family so the logical conclusion is to get rid of his family. The stalker decides he must prove that he knows the billionaire better than his family and that the billionaire doesn‚Äôt show his ‚Äúreal self‚Äù to the public and is really wearing a mask around everyone. The stalker wants to show the billionaire his ‚Äútrue self‚Äô in return so he has an unlicensed plastic surgeon cut his face off and fashion it into a mask for the stalker to wear. The stalker then escapes from the asylum and goes about his plan to make a ‚ÄúLove Letter‚Äù for the billionaire. He kidnaps the billionaire‚Äôs fianc√©e children friends and surrogate father one by one individually physically and psychologically torturing them. The stalker failed to have his severed face mask leathered or preserved in any way. During his sessions with each victim his face slowly begins to rot insects have infested his face and he has developed a horrid infection spraying bl**d puss spit and bits of decade flesh onto each victim while speaking to them. The stalker then proceeds to enact his love letter by setting an elaborate dinner for the billionaire. Each of the kidnaped victims are set as guest at the dinner table with bandaged faces a silver covered dish in front of them. The stalker now dressed in an expensive suit is busily applying lipstick to his severed face mask because he wants to look ‚Äúgood‚Äù for his billionaire. Once the billionaire arrives the stalker physically overpowers him even though the stalker is extremely thin with atrophied muscles and a sever staff infection while the billionaire is in good physical condition with the body of an athlete. The Stalker ties up the billionaire and sets him at the head of the table he calls the billionaire ‚ÄúDarling‚Äù and tells the billionaire that he is a king and the stalker is his humble jester. The stalker proceeds to explain how the billionaire doesn‚Äôt need his family just him and that he feels like the billionaire‚Äôs family if interfering with their one-on-one time. The billionaire tells the stalker he is insane and means nothing to him that he never wants to see him again to leave him and his family alone (the whole classic victim spell that everyone screams at their stalker)! When the billionaire‚Äôs family starts to wake up the stalker pulls back the silver platters to reveal all his family‚Äôs faces have been cut off and served on plates of ice‚Ä¶eventually the billionaire is able to overcome the extremely thin mentally ill gangrenous stalker with atrophied muscles.) I‚Äôm not sure why the billionaire couldn‚Äôt before honestly I guess because of plot development.) The billionaire then goes on to free his family and is relieved to see they all still have their faces. The bandages and faces were only FX effects.

Synopsis: The argument between Talia and Bruce is catastrophic from beginning to end and while the whole truth is revealed neither of them wants to let go of you. Strange was always a greater danger than he let on and was closer than he ever thought.  Warnings: Family discussion; meaningless kiss; aggression; blood; kidnapping; maternal possessiveness;   Word count:4.5k  Note: Talia has a slightly different relationship with Bruce in my story compared to the canon being more tense than the impression I got when I watched scenes between the two of them.  I forget to mention that English is not my first language forgive me for any mistakes.  Part 1 - Part 2 - Part 3 - Part 4 - Part 5 - Part 6  &lt;!-- more --&gt;   ‚ÄúIs it true?‚Äù Bruce asked quickly barely giving Talia time to dare say anything before him. The woman rolled her eyes still with her back to him and prepared to maintain her confident pose.  She turned to face him and took a few moments to admire the vision blatantly diverting her eyes to his lips and seeing how the messy shirt had given him a more fierce and attractive aura. Their relationship was complicated that‚Äôs a fact but she could never stop finding the man in front of her charmingly handsome.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need to be more specific than that‚Äù Talia‚Äôs voice dripped with a sweet and wicked tone as she walked toward him. Bruce violently stood up from the chair when he saw her hand reach towards him and imposed his height over hers to intimidate.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt play the cynic.‚Äù There was a suppressed fury in his tone and she was sure he was using the last bit of self-control that still possessed.  ‚ÄúFor heaven‚Äôs sake Bruce.‚Äù Talia mocked picking up the coat she had intended to grab from the beginning from the chair having recognized it as yours. She grimaced as felt the damp fabric and dropped it in a corner of the room on the floor. The look she was receiving could burn her skin and when she turned her face back to his she realized how disturbed he was. ‚ÄúYou look horrible. Strange really got into your head didn‚Äôt he?‚Äù  Talia saw him narrow his eyes with impatient indignation as he snorted. She found seeing him like this very peculiar and thought it would be fun to try and provoke.  The woman brought her face close to his making her warm breath touch his chin provocatively while boldly wrapping her arms around the broad neck. She tested the waters seeing how he remained still and brushed her red lips along his jawline then moved up until their mouths shared the same breath.  She was going to try to persuade convince him that he was overthinking and smiled inwardly when she saw Bruce become disconcerted for a second completely unresponsive when she sealed their lips together. She managed to seduce him in that second to the point where unconsciously he moved his tongue with hers but tasting her saliva brought him back to rationality.  He left her in complete shock when abruptly pushed her away and grabbed her face in an aggressive manner squeezing the cheeks and making her squirm until eyes glazed over into his. ‚ÄúYou repulse me.‚Äù Bruce spat and was glad to see her bold expression disappear. ‚ÄúTell me once: she is mine?‚Äú  Talia tried to take his hand away with hers but he seemed implacable and didn‚Äôt even move a finger out of place. He might be stronger but she wasn‚Äôt weak and that was what made her let out an astonished sob.  &quot;She is my daughter?!‚Äù He shouted shaking her no longer able to take the lack of response.  ‚ÄúYes it is true.‚Äù The confession made him let go of her finally and she almost stumbled back with how sudden it was.  She massaged her face seeking relief and it didn‚Äôt take long for her eyebrows to furrow in shock. Bruce felt no pity or regret she deserved much more than he would ever have the courage to do.  ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù By the way he looked she knew there was no more room for lies or evasion. She had never seen him like this; Bruce had always been the most balanced man she had ever known in her entire life.  ‚ÄúShe and Damian are twins‚Äù Talia responded immediately.  ‚ÄúTwins?‚Äù Bruce‚Äôs voice sounded incredulous. He felt that even all the time in the universe wouldn‚Äôt be enough to process that. It seemed simply unreal. ‚ÄúWhy did you hide this? Why did you tell me about Damian and not about her?‚Äù  ‚ÄúBecause you would have taken her from me!‚Äù She shouted running her fingers over her face to check if her makeup had smeared. ‚ÄúI handed Damian over to you willingly but if you had found out about him before you would have brought him here just the same. And with her it would be no different. You should be grateful to have had the boy.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHow dare you say such a thing?‚Äù Bruce threw the chair to the floor in a fit of rage making a loud noise that echoed even outside the hallway. ‚ÄúAnd ‚Äòhanded Damian over willingly‚Äô? You only did that because you felt pressured after your father died.‚Äù He threw it in her face and suddenly remembered something: ‚ÄúYou made that boy lie for you.‚Äù He accused her.  Talia was silent for a brief moment but her face showed nothing but contempt. ‚ÄúI did yes.‚Äù She admitted.  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of that? Was it just out of whim?‚Äù Bruce seemed fragile before her for the first time in so many years. For a moment she glimpsed an old argument from when they were still dating and didn‚Äôt hide feelings from each other as they do today. ‚ÄúDo you hold that much resentment? You know very well why I dismissed the League of Assassins.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOf course Bruce. Your morals are too valuable aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù Talia replied with her chin up not letting him affect her. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre a good guy a pure superhero like Superman. But I know you and I know how rotten you are inside. You are not as different from us as you think.‚Äù She spewed the words in his face like venom.  ‚ÄúYou wanted her to come here didn‚Äôt you? You and he planned all this?‚Äù Comprehension seemed to have hit Bruce but that only left the woman confused.  ‚ÄúIf it were up to me you would never have discovered her existence. Why would I send her here?‚Äù The confession left him silent not because he wasn‚Äôt angry anymore but because he was tired of hearing her voice; he simply couldn‚Äôt believe anything Talia said. ‚ÄúShe is my daughter. And I don‚Äôt care what you‚Äôre going to do now but don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going to drag her with you like you did with all those boys.‚Äù  &quot;You think you can offer something better? You the same person who left her in the hands of that sicko consider yourself a better option?‚Äù Bruce insinuated this with a firmness that made it clear he had no doubt Talia was cooperating with Strange making her eyes turn red. She could hear many insults from him but insinuating that she had put you at risk was something entirely different. ‚ÄúYou can be sure you won‚Äôt lay another finger on her.‚Äù  She knew Bruce was serious and that he could actually prevent any future contact betwedn you and her. She wanted to kill him right now out of sheer hatred but she was smart and knew that acting impulsively wouldn‚Äôt solve anything. So reluctantly she tried to change the tone of the discussion to a neutral one. There was no way she could leave without giving him explanations and if she tried he would stop her.  ‚ÄúMaybe Strange had been threatening me for some time possibly before deciding to appear publicly again and attack you.‚Äù There was a slight irony of indignation in her words. Her gaze was firm and her green eyes shining with the intensity of someone defending their own honor. ‚ÄúLet it be clear: I didn‚Äôt help anyone; I was as much a victim of this as you were.‚Äù  ‚ÄúVictim?‚Äù Bruce retorted with disdain.  ‚ÄúThis threat wasn‚Äôt for you Bruce it was for me. Today you didn‚Äôt lose anything quite the opposite.‚Äù She ignored the acidic tone and continued. ‚ÄúMaybe this contributed to some kind of psychological game Strange is playing against you but it must be just a bonus.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhy is he threatening you?‚Äù The question contained no compassion or empathy but it didn‚Äôt matter to her to receive that kind of consideration from him.  ‚ÄúWhat did he do to you?‚Äù Talia ignored the question and as a form of childish revenge he did the same. She sighed and tried a different approach: ‚ÄúIf you tell me I‚Äôll tell you too.‚Äù She needed to know to try to understand the depth of Strange‚Äôs current intentions or at least get some clue about the plan he was plotting because although she wouldn‚Äôt say it to Bruce she was also trying to catch him.  ‚ÄúA photo of my parents‚Äù he confessed trying to sound indifferent before continuing ‚ÄúPhotos of the boys of Alfred‚Ä¶‚Äù Bruce left the sentence hanging in the air and didn‚Äôt proceed. He would never say more than he deemed necessary to her.  ‚ÄúDamian too?‚Äù She asked worried about her son and saw Bruce nod affirmatively. Bruce calmly unwrinkled a card while handing it to her.  ‚ÄúHe asked her to deliver this to me today.‚Äù His tone was serious revealing a determination to deal with the situation pragmatically and directly.  Talia repeated those printed words several times and every hair on her body stood on end all at once. ‚ÄúDid she‚Ä¶?‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt read it.‚Äù He said curtly. ‚ÄúBut what I don‚Äôt understand is how all this seems so convenient and you claim to have nothing to do with it. He had this card perfectly prepared.‚Äù  ‚ÄúKnowing him well he must have been waiting for an opportunity for many days or he induced this to happen somehow.‚Äù She reflected scratching the fine texture with her nails right where the text was printed to the point of making it illegible. ‚ÄúThe letter that Damian said she picked up took longer to arrive than the others; it must have ended up with him at some point.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHow could he be so close and you didn‚Äôt notice?‚Äù His voice became aggressive again the same beastly rage returning.  ‚ÄúI did notice! I just didn‚Äôt imagine Strange interested in her; I thought it was about Damian. So I didn‚Äôt worry because he wasn‚Äôt with me; he was with you.‚Äù She raised her voice trying to match his volume. ‚ÄúStrange has been sending me coded messages. Threats that had nothing to do with my daughter. I thought he didn‚Äôt know she was yours and therefore wouldn‚Äôt care about her.‚Äù She finished and Bruce clenched his jaw observing how she increasingly emphasized the expression ‚Äúmy daughter‚Äù excluding him.  ‚ÄúThreats related to Damian?‚Äù He asked. His muscles were tense and sore but he endured the discomfort if it meant clarifying everything once and for all. ‚ÄúAnd of course you never considered telling me.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis started long before I left him with you Bruce. They were still children.‚Äù Talia said growing increasingly frustrated with the conversation.  ‚ÄúWhat could Damian have done to him as a child?‚Äù  ‚ÄúDamian ended up leaving Strange with one less eye. He was already pursuing him because of you but after losing an eye all he wanted was revenge.‚Äù She walked to the bed leaning on the arms while crossing her legs. A very characteristic gesture of her behavior which was highlighted when she wore her extravagant dresses but the cold pants she wore made the movements relaxed. ‚ÄúHe was a child; he didn‚Äôt do it on purpose. He was just protecting his sister.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHow could Strange have known about Damian for so long and not about her? What you‚Äôre saying doesn‚Äôt make any sense Talia.‚Äù Bruce was frantic and after a brief moment of melancholy she sighed:   ‚ÄúI blame my father for this.‚Äù Her voice almost wavered in front of him but being the proud person she was she quickly composed herself.  ‚ÄúWhat did Ra‚Äôs do?‚Äù He threw the question into the air laden with apprehension.  The room plunged into a disturbing silence. Talia remained motionless while the sound of Bruce‚Äôs heavy breathing was the only thing breaking the void in the atmosphere. For a brief moment her eyes met his and captured the storm of emotions brewing there: betrayal despair expectation.  She did not fear him but rather how he might react to this. You were there nearby in the hallway and the last thing she wanted was for the primal figure Bruce was becoming to explode and expel her taking you to him. Moreover she needed to remind herself that she was at a disadvantage there. It wasn‚Äôt just Bruce she would face if things turned worse or physical but everyone else in the house.  ‚ÄúWhat did he do Talia?‚Äù Bruce growled repeating the question with intensity.  She stared at the floor fully aware that her next words would turn against her later but at this point he needed to know. Strange was out there and he was still as much of a psychopath obsessed with Batman as before meaning he wouldn‚Äôt rest until he managed to take Bruce‚Äôs place as a vigilante. So with a low but icy voice she moved her mouth to tell him the truth:  ‚ÄúYears ago Strange sought out the League of Assassins. That lunatic was always smart and somehow discovered the rift between you and my father.‚Äù The mention of such an old event took Bruce by surprise. He slightly recoiled and his eyebrows raised but he restrained himself from interrupting her. ‚ÄúHe wanted the League to help him defeat you and vice versa. My father was suspicious but he was so resentful that he agreed. Your betrayal was still fresh to us.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAnd of course it went wrong didn‚Äôt it?‚Äù He asked with implicit sarcasm.  ‚ÄúStrange was so cunning that he managed to manipulate him to his advantage. He provided us with precise and important information about you but after a while he wanted to advise my father on how to act. That‚Äôs when I started to hate him realizing how he was controlling.‚Äù She shook her head in denial recalling the memory with bitterness and continued:  ‚ÄúMy father trusted him so much that he allowed Strange to infiltrate us more and more until one day by chance he found damian in Nanda Parbat. Strange was nosy and curious; he tried to extract the information from me but discovered on his own that you were his father.‚Äù Talia blew a strand of hair that fell on her face and decided to add the next part with acidity: ‚ÄúStrange was so fascinated by this that he made an absurd request. We denied it and then he rebelled against us. Of course that incompetent couldn‚Äôt accomplish anything and then disappeared as he always does when things go wrong.‚Äù  ‚ÄúRa‚Äôs and Strange working together?‚Äù Bruce asked himself. He could never have imagined that two such distinct people could have had a relationship like that in the past. ‚ÄúAnd what did he ask for?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe was obsessed with surpassing you but it wasn‚Äôt just that he wanted to be you and have everything that was yours. He asked to raise Damian as if he were his own son can you believe it? Luckily Y/n never set foot in Nanda Parbat so he didn‚Äôt discover her in that time.‚Äù She paused for a moment reliving the events. ‚ÄúHe wanted to prove that he could raise him and make a better Robin. Strange has known your identities much longer than you think; he knew the real Robin was your adopted son.‚Äù  Bruce‚Äôs face contorted in an expression of disbelief. His eyes narrowed slightly and his mouth opened as if about to say something but the words seemed stuck in his throat. He blinked a few times needing to assimilate what he had heard. ‚ÄúIf he never saw her before how did all this happen?‚Äù  ‚ÄúA few years later when my father hadn‚Äôt been dead for long I returned to live in Gotham City with Y/n and Strange found out Damian was here too and broke into the apartment where we were. He intended to kidnap Damian but he used to share a room with his sister and by mistake Strange went to her bed.‚Äù She spoke with a heavy voice the last sentence sending chills down her spine but she persisted:  ‚ÄúI woke up to her frightened scream and a loud noise. I ran and when I saw it was him I had no mercy. He is intelligent but sometimes he is blinded by his own obsession and do stupid things. He was already bleeding with a pencil piercing one of his eyes thanks to Damian then fled through the living room. I didn‚Äôt initially chase after him because I wanted to make sure Damian was okay; the problem was I hadn‚Äôt realized that Y/n wasn‚Äôt in the room. Damian had distracted Strange to let his sister escape and because of my delay he took her.‚Äù  Talia seemed to be in a trance. Each word weighed on her chest like lead yet she threw them out as if they were disposable. Her usually confident and determined eyes didn‚Äôt know where to look. Sitting rigidly on the bed her imposing posture didn‚Äôt waver as her pride didn‚Äôt allow her to show weakness.  ‚ÄúWhat did he do?‚Äù Bruce throat tightened as if the air was rarefied as he waited for the answer. Talia might think otherwise but he could see through her facade. And despite it being selfish to say this he couldn‚Äôt feel a shred of concern for her especially when someone more important to him was now involved.  After standing for so long Bruce sat on the bed next to her. He reflected on the sad incident deeply disturbed. He blamed her. He blamed her for her character for lying so much and for hiding from him that his children were in danger. He was grateful that she had fallen silent for a few seconds as he was mentally preparing himself for a grim scenario one he wasn‚Äôt yet ready to face.  ‚ÄúWhat happened to her?‚Äù He asked seeing that she wasn‚Äôt showing signs of speaking trying to prompt her to continue.  ‚ÄúStrange carried her through the city desperately fleeing from me until he ended up in an alley. He encountered a group of drunks who surrounded and wanted to rob him. He‚Äôs not a good fighter you already know that and like a damn coward he threw her into their midst as a distraction while he escaped again.‚Äù   ‚ÄúUnbelievable‚Ä¶‚Äù Bruce massaged his eyebrows with his eyes closed visibly upset. He pressed his temples hard as if trying to dispel the accumulated frustration. After a deep breath he suddenly exploded in a shout of frustration and anger just like at the beginning. ‚ÄúYou should have contacted me!‚Äù  ‚ÄúAre you trying to blame me?!‚Äù She asked indignantly.  ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt seem to recognize him when she spoke to me just now. It sounded like she was talking about a random stranger.‚Äù Bruce was confused.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if she would recognize him again she never wanted to talk to me about that day. And I never mentioned Hugo Strange either everything she knows about him she sees on the news.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou and your father are the worst kind of people I could have gotten involved with‚Äù Bruce said his voice dangerously low this time. ‚ÄúIf it weren‚Äôt for Ra‚Äôs Strange would never have gotten close to them. If it weren‚Äôt for your stupid lie nothing you just said would have happened. And I don‚Äôt even want to imagine what the hell happened after that!‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou would have made sure nothing like that happened wouldn‚Äôt you Bruce? You talk about it with such certainty but weren‚Äôt you the one who let the Joker do something similar to that kid‚Ä¶ Is Jason his name?‚Äù Her mention of something like that made Bruce‚Äôs ears go deaf. He could clearly hear the sound of his heart beating inside his chest until her disgusting voice sounded again: ‚ÄúYou would have put her in the same disgrace!‚Äù  Bruce lost the control he tried so hard to maintain from the beginning. He threw the lamp next to him into the headboard on the wall. The movement was so violent that the wire connecting the object to the socket broke in a strange way and the entire glass part broke into several pieces. The noise was thunderous and even when he stood up with a piercing look at her Talia continued with her laughing face enjoying watching him go crazy.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to compare the two things. You didn‚Äôt tell me about Strange before because you were embarrassed. It‚Äôs too hard for you to admit that you can fail. Besides you always liked having someone to control to manipulate at your pleasure. You did this to her didn‚Äôt you? And even then you‚Äôre not satisfied. You continued to torment Damian using him.‚Äù Bruce took a deep breath.‚ÄúI thought you cared about him.‚Äù  Talia got up too and lifted her chin her eyes shining with defiance. ‚ÄúYou understand nothing Bruce‚Äù she responded with a firm and cutting voice. ‚ÄúEverything I did was to protect them both. I explained my reasons to you. Do you think hiding them was just my decision? My father would never have allowed it and I won‚Äôt deny that I wasn‚Äôt against him but it didn‚Äôt depend solely on me. You with your inflexible morality and your rules would never understand.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give me that‚Äù Bruce growled his gaze fixed and penetrating. ‚ÄúYou branded the girl with your initials like she was cattle. It was never about protection; it‚Äôs possessiveness.‚Äù  Like him Talia stood up. ‚ÄúI may be a woman of whims as you like to say but I didn‚Äôt hide anything because I was embarrassed‚Äù  Talia paused her voice softening but not positively. ‚ÄúAnd as for tormenting him‚Ä¶ I trained him prepared him for the cruel world we live in. Do you think you could keep him safe with your mild methods? He needs to be strong needs to be able to survive and in those years I taught him to protect her because no one else would. My father didn‚Äôt care about a granddaughter; he finally had the male heir he wanted. I had to meet his demands to make Damian perfect and that allowed me the freedom to raise her away from all that. What I could do I did. And what I wanted to do I also did. And I‚Äôd do it all again.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou always think you did everything right but everything you‚Äôve said only proves how misguided you are. I remember I gave you a choice Talia. I told you that you could abandon the League of Assassins and come with me. I told you that your father didn‚Äôt need to control your life forever‚Äù Bruce said his voice laden with disdain. ‚ÄúYou will never come near her again. You‚Äôll have to go over my dead body first.‚Äù  Talia narrowed her eyes in contempt. ‚ÄúDo you really think you can stop me?‚Äù Her voice was low and controlled but each word carried significant weight. ‚ÄúYou always saw the world in black and white. Do you really think it was so simple to abandon my entire life and devotion for you a mere fleeting romance? If you think it‚Äôs that easy to give up everything I challenge you to abandon Batman right now. After all it‚Äôs because of this secret identity of yours that all this started isn‚Äôt it? Isn‚Äôt it as easy as that Bruce?‚Äù  She took a step forward facing him without wavering. ‚ÄúI can repeat it as many times as you want: I am a criminal I am selfish and whatever else you want me to say but the only hypocrite in this room is you.‚Äù Her eyes shone with determination while his wavered before her.  Bruce hardened his expression sadness hitting him. He wanted to accuse her of being a low person but deep in his conscience he feared it was true. But he wouldn‚Äôt allow himself to be deceived; she was still the wrong one here. She was the one who completely distorted the situation making herself the victim and trying to justify everything she did turning him into the villain of the story.  ‚ÄúTalia I never wanted you to be any of these things‚Äù he began his voice laden with anguish. He felt bitterness looking at her face now as it painfully reminded him of the time when he had been deeply in love with this same woman. ‚ÄúI wanted to believe you could change that you would be different from your father. But every choice you made every lie you told‚Ä¶ Our relationship was unsustainable and now the only thing I feel for you is remorse.‚Äù  He closed the last distance between them imposing himself with a somber aura. ‚ÄúYour actions your alliances‚Ä¶ they put her at risk. My duty as a father is to protect her and I can‚Äôt ignore the danger you represent. I never wanted it to come to this Talia. But if keeping her safe means keeping her away from you then that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do.‚Äù  Talia clenched her fists her expression hardening even more. ‚ÄúDo you think I didn‚Äôt want to protect her too?‚Äù Her voice became silky. There was a dark delight in how the words dragged a subtle poison hidden in each intonation. ‚ÄúYou talk about protecting her but she needs more than simple physical protection. She needs a mother someone who understands the complexity of her feelings.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLook at yourself for a moment Bruce‚Äù said Talia her voice icy and full of disdain. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre losing your composure. Do you really think she‚Äôll like finding out that her father is this weak and ridiculous man you‚Äôve become?‚Äù  The woman took a step forward fixing her eyes on his with a challenging gleam. ‚ÄúThe only thing she‚Äôll feel for you is shame.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDo you really think you can tell me who I‚Äôve become?‚Äù He paused swallowing hard. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want it to come to this Talia but if you don‚Äôt leave voluntarily I‚Äôll be forced to tell that girl everything you‚Äôve done. And then we‚Äôll let her decide.‚Äù  He intensified the confrontation provoking her: ‚ÄúAre you sure she would still choose you after so many lies? After everything you‚Äôve hidden from her?‚Äù His eyes darkened pupils dilated by the dim light in the room. ‚ÄúValue the good image she still has of you.‚Äù  Talia was momentarily silent her eyes meeting Bruce‚Äôs with a genuine expression of concern. She took a deep breath before speaking her voice a bit more dangerous than before. ‚ÄúWould you really do that? Tell her everything?‚Äù  Bruce replied firmly maintaining his serious gaze on hers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what I must do regardless of everything. Continuing to hide things isn‚Äôt right. But if the only way for you to leave more easily is under this condition then go now.‚Äù  Talia took a few steps back her serious expression showing shock and worry. Her thoughts repeated Bruce‚Äôs ultimatum continuously knowing you would not react well to it.   You were a smart girl but emotionally very fragile. Your bonds of trust were limited to her and your brother and you two had been apart for so long that having your relationship with your mother destroyed in this way would leave a huge scar on your heart. This would be the best choice both for her and for you if Talia didn‚Äôt want everything to fall apart.  She turned towards the bedroom hallway as if seeking a moment to ponder the consequences. After a moment she turned her gaze back to Bruce her shoulders slightly lower. ‚ÄúYou are not going to involve her in your vigilante life.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt a request it was a warning and Bruce didn‚Äôt contest it to avoid further conflict. Understanding that she had decided to leave was enough to reassure him.  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to.‚Äù He walked past her picking up your coat she had thrown on the floor earlier checking carefully that it hadn‚Äôt been damaged by the broken lampshade and lifting the chair to let the piece dry once more.  ‚ÄúYou know where the exit is; don‚Äôt take too long.‚Äù Without bothering to be polite he quickly opened the door leaving her standing there. He knew she would really leave after seeing how she reacted. She wouldn‚Äôt risk irritating him by taking longer than necessary.

18,Batman,['dc comics'  'dc robin'],furiouswithoutthefast,I love Batman but some of the times I find it hard to get into the series because of the way some of his kids are incredibly similar. It‚Äôs a blessing and a curse. And by similar I don‚Äôt mean personality wise I mean their ways of thinking. For example in Robins the comic when they discuss being Robin a lot of them have a very similar opinion and idea with only Jason and Damian having a more drastic difference from the rest.  It doesn‚Äôt make the comic boring but it definitely makes it hard to get into when there‚Äôs not enough diversity to connect with the characters. I think all the Robins are fun but it‚Äôs definitely odd to me how they all think the same about the Robin mantel.   I don‚Äôt know if I explained this well but to summarize I want different thought processes on the Robin mantel rather than the same thing thought behind it. But it does make sense given how some of them were young when they became Robin. But I‚Äôll also argue that a lot of adults would still stick by the decisions younger them made as a lot of people are simply stubborn. But this would go into more of a self-centered rant so I won‚Äôt get into it.,2024-07-12 16:07:43 GMT

Bruce talks about how fast he is but rarely is it talked about how much it takes to stand up to one of the most trained people on the planet.  We can put his size/strength into perspective by thinking that he can carry a giant solid wooden mallet by himself.  Have you ever seen a person irl doing log lifting carry a piece of wood the size of someone as big as Superman with this ease??  He can even drag Jason and Tim‚Äôs dead weight WITH A SINGLE ARM.  It‚Äôs obvious that he can also carry Batman he has to put him in traps or tie him up alone. But we actually see him do it and it seems like he has no trouble???

171,Batman,['cassandra cain'  'batgirl 2000'  'batgirl'  'bruce wayne'  'the father daughter duo of all time'  "she's his favourite but that's not necessarily a good thing"],casscainmainly,Bruce Wayne &amp; Cassandra Cain in Batgirl (2000) My last post covered the top 10 moments overall but I had to skip a lot of my favourite moments involving specifically Batman and Batgirl. So here‚Äôs a non-comprehensive chronological list of great Bruce &amp; Cass moments!!  Who Does She Remind You Of? One of the most interesting things about their relationship is that initially Cass doesn‚Äôt have a name and doesn‚Äôt know Bruce‚Äôs name; they are purely Batgirl and Batman. This lack of alter ego allows Bruce to identify very heavily with Cass and sets up the foundation for why Bruce acts the way he does later. He views Cass as a mirror of himself which has both positive and negative repercussions.   You Can‚Äôt Understand A Word I‚Äôm Saying EXTREMELY underrated Bruce and Cass moment from Issue #2. Though I believe they fundamentally understand each other there‚Äôs still a disconnect between them (a disconnect Cass shares with everyone). But this disconnect goes both ways - Bruce is the one having trouble communicating here saying ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know how to say this‚Äô and pausing frequently (this speech pattern is very reminiscent of Cass‚Äô inner monologue towards the end of this run!). A great example of how neither of them are fully able to express the depth of their feelings towards each other.   Denial A pivotal moment in Bruce‚Äôs conception of Cass. When confronted with evidence that she killed a man Bruce goes into complete denial. She‚Äôs &#x27;gentle‚Äô fully understanding his rejection of murder; how can she be a murderer? It‚Äôs indicative of just how much he‚Äôs projecting onto Cass but also how much he genuinely cares about her. The second panel is underrated too - like David Cain Bruce sees Cass as &#x27;perfect‚Äô a word that will haunt Cass for arcs to come. This is where we start to see how Bruce‚Äôs belief in Cass‚Äô perfection and morals negatively impacts her self-conception (as a perfect tool/weapon).   Good Answer An incredible moment that‚Äôs classic for a reason. Perfectly encapsulates both Cass‚Äô instinctive desire to protect and Bruce‚Äôs recognition of how similar Cass is to him. Also how his belief in her however unintentionally feeds into her death wish.  Jason Todd Another underrated moment!!! This is the first major instance of conflict between death-wish Cass and no-more-dead-kids Bruce and it‚Äôs delicious. Bruce willingly opens up to her about Jason‚Äôs death and moreover by comparing Cass to Jason positions her as his child as well. It‚Äôs sweet and sad and explains some of Bruce‚Äôs more overprotective moments.  Denial 2 Not really denial but thematically it fits. When Bruce is framed for murder the Batfam try to figure out what really happened. Cass sees that Dick has doubts and helps him re-enact the murder so that he can believe in Bruce again. Not only is it a super sweet Dick-Cass moment but it also shows how Cass believes in Bruce just as much as Bruce believes in Cass.   Good A short and sweet moment that showcases how similar these two are. Bruce isn‚Äôt exactly being a good dad here but Cass genuinely DIDN‚ÄôT enjoy that vacation. They just get each other. This is one of many many times that Cass answers one of Bruce‚Äôs questions perfectly (and makes Bruce smile).   Overprotective Dad Mode In the second part of Batgirl (2000) Cass begins to explore her sexuality. This leads to issues of varying quality BUT we do get tons of overprotective Bruce. A nice showcase of Bruce doing typical dad stuff and Superman looking SO done. Also Cass in that first panel is hilarious.   Realisation After lots of (rightful) heckling from Babs Bruce finally realises that the way he‚Äôs been using and treating Cass isn‚Äôt right. Though this speech is couched in a lot of dismissive language (&#x27;disobedient‚Äô &#x27;she was loyal‚Äô) I think that‚Äôs just Bruce‚Äôs inability to communicate. He cannot admit how much he cares for her. So he decides to fire her and tells her she jeopardises the MISSION (which obviously makes Cass feel terrible). Even when he‚Äôs trying to put her first his lack of communication skills only hurts her.  He Never Let Me Touch Him The Bruce and Cass scene to END all Bruce and Cass scenes. Each panel is loaded with meaning. The first shows that despite Bruce‚Äôs similarities to Cain he still IS different; he is willing to be vulnerable around her and allows her to do the same around him. The third panel is particularly interesting. Underneath all the ideological sniping between him and Babs Bruce is jealous - he wants to be the centre of Cass‚Äô life and loyalty. Cass however doesn‚Äôt fall into the trap. By pointing to the Bat she both affirms her loyalty to his mission but also refuses any box he can put her in. She is his daughter but she is not only his daughter and never will be.  Honourable mention: the only reason I didn‚Äôt put the Father‚Äôs Day panel here was because I‚Äôve already written about it. Also the scene where they mutually touch each other‚Äôs faces and turn away of course!,2024-07-12 18:53:07 GMT

In the course of a decade Batman had not one but two wonderful animated series - The Batman and Brave and the Bold the ladder being a course on DC history.

Cleft lip a blemish something in-universe to explain its scarred look. I think this would not only fit a modern day outlook (I know it‚Äôs mostly Harvey thinking he can no longer be an attorney thanks to the deformity but yknow) but give an external force to Harvey‚Äôs complex thoughts. The scarring isn‚Äôt the catalyst this time  2) in order to find a middle between ‚Äúgood lawyer who had one bad day/bad childhood‚Äù and ‚Äúcorrupt politician‚Äù - how about he‚Äôs an Aaron Burr.

Meanwhile when it originally happened he was calm til Bruce started hinting that he low-key blamed Dick in part for Jason‚Äôs death.     It feels like many comics especially during the Dixon run make him far more angrier then he was portrayed in the past. During NTT which is what Dixon is taking from he was usually the calm level headed one who thought things through and processed them.  I‚Äôm not saying Dick can‚Äôt get angry because he does but I feel like starting with Dixon they made him get angrier much faster than he would before.  It feels like a bad recon to me but I admit that could be personal taste and that‚Äôs just my 2 cents.,2024-07-12 21:05:07 GMT

This will be an even longer version of that with more description as I don‚Äôt have the pesky world limit here! I wanted to start this out by saying I may get some things wrong and this was something I‚Äôd originally had posted on a Mastodon Server my friends are running so I wasn‚Äôt checking it over very much just wanted to get my thoughts out! There are probably a lot of different ways this comic can be read but I‚Äôm particularly enamored by queer readings of comics so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be focusing on today. This won‚Äôt be exhaustive on the queer metaphors in this comic and I‚Äôd be happy for people to add on to what I say! I‚Äôm not an expert on making analysis posts so forgive me if anything is unclear or out of place. I‚Äôm also getting used to Tumblr formatting but fans here tend to be more active so I really wanted to share here! With that let‚Äôs get into it  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Brief Summary Before getting into my reading I thought it best to give a (semi-) brief Summary of the comic itself. There‚Äôs also someone context from the previous comic (as this is part of a trilogy!) that I‚Äôll try to provide too but a lot of the material I‚Äôll talk about isn‚Äôt really dependent on the fact you have the experience of reading Red Rain.   In ‚ÄúBatman: Bloodstorm‚Äù Bruce has been turned into a vampire (the previous comic delves into how this happened but just know he‚Äôs sort of shed the identity of ‚ÄúBruce Wayne‚Äù and has given in to being Batman more ‚Äúfull time‚Äù). Batman finds out there are vampires he has not ‚Äúkilled‚Äù yet (as he had killed a large sum of them in Red Rain)(Because Vampires are undead he does not consider it murder to take them out). While he hunts these vamps down he is heavily resisting the urge to suck blood and because he has resisted it he is getting progressively weaker to the point it‚Äôs hard to do much of anything. In the first comic Tanya (a vampire woman he had become friends with) had synthesized this replacement for blood that would keep her alive and well without the need to kill. Bruce tries to recreate this but it‚Äôs not enough for him and he continues to become weaker the most he resists sucking blood.  While this is happening Joker has started working with the vampires LOL he‚Äôs just being Joker using his charm and stuff to get them to comply.   Cut to Selina who we see get attacked by a werewolf like creature and she becomes a werecat from this attack (I‚Äôd like to note the way this was framed it very much reads like sexual assault). She intends to get her male attacker back for what he did to her.  Selina attacks Batman believing him to be the man but they clear it up fast that he is not. She wants to help him but in Batman fashion he denies her help.   There‚Äôs this woman who Batman has been going to trying to gain information on these super natural occurrings. He asks her if it‚Äôs possible for him to survive when he doesn‚Äôt drink blood and asks what an alternative may be. She basically says GET A BITCH! (he needs the loving touch of a woman or something)   When he runs away from the woman Selina finds him and takes him to her apartment where they cuddle until morning and he DOES feel better after this. Like a considerable amount. He feels like his weakness is going away. So he lets her in on his scheme to catch the Joker and the rest of the vamps. They go to find them and take them down.  During the scuffle Joker shoots Selina with an arrow and she‚Äôs killed. Batman filled with rage finally gives in to his urge to suck blood and he sucks the Jokers blood. Making sure to take the necessary precautions afterwards to ensure Joker doesn‚Äôt come back to life as a vampire.   In this world if you suck blood you become impure and start to have reactions to stereotypical vampire deterrents. Batman believes himself to be unsafe now that he‚Äôs sucked blood and tasks Gordan and Alfred with killing him.  How is this queer? In this section we will operate under the assumption queerness and vampirism are inherently intertwined in this story. That is to say vampirism is just a stand in for queerness or queer experiences. Vampires and vampire media has been queercoded and littered with queer subtext for DECADES. I recommend reading up on it or if you‚Äôre into Video Essays I really enjoyed this video about the bisexualness of Dracula specifically!  In these next images Batman is talking to another vampire about his vampirism (or more like the Vampire is talking AT him and Batman tries to deny it).   Batman says that he does NOT drink blood and the way the vampire responds seems almost erotic lol? He tells Batman that he knows he WANTS to drink blood and that sooner or later he‚Äôll just have to give in to it. Again batman denies denies denies but it‚Äôs because he knows it to be TRUE the desire is only getting stronger.   The vampire calls him a ‚Äúfilthy blood junkie‚Äù (to me this seems akin to calling a queer person ‚Äúfaggot‚Äù perhaps). The way he says that the vampirism is just ‚Äútempting the natural predator in him.‚Äù struck me as a way of saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôve always been queer but the urge (to do something about it) is undeniable now so what are you going to do about it?‚Äù The vampire goes on to say he used to HATE the site of blood (perhaps that he used to hate his own queerness and hid from it) but now that he‚Äôs a vampire he craves it. It gives him satisfaction exactly what he needs he can‚Äôt get enough of it.   This whole interaction reads (to me) as this man describing his queer awakening to Batman connecting his own experience to Batmans recognizing the signs. But Batman doesn‚Äôt believe this. He doesn‚Äôt WANT to give in.   These next images I share focus on Batman denying himself blood.  He describes how he‚Äôs become addicted to the idea of something he‚Äôs never even had before. This resonated with me when you‚Äôre discovering your queerness it seems a lot bigger than it is (bc being queer would be something easy if there weren‚Äôt societal pressures) and craving to have this experience you‚Äôve never gotten. He seems afraid of himself. He sees himself as a predator as someone people should fear. He doesn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äútempted‚Äù by Alfred. I dont think he‚Äôd ever do anything to Alfred here in a queer reading I‚Äôd say this is the result of being told by people that you are predatory for who you love and it becoming so Ingrained in your sense of self you BELIEVE it.   Next I want to touch on WHY Bruce is so comforted by Selina. Why she literally makes him stronger I have two ways I think this could be taken in my reading.   After cuddling with Selina all night Batman feels MUCH better. He is getting his strength back just from being near her.  1) This is an interpretation I think is sweet above anything else that I was thinking about while reading. Selina is a werecat Batman is a vampire. They can relate to eachother. They‚Äôre both queer. They‚Äôre both feared for something they cannot control. The reason Batman finds comfort in Selina is because she is his community. Living in places where there aren‚Äôt a lot of openly queer people finding another queer person is a major comfort. You feel less alone. She is giving him something he‚Äôs desperately needed and that‚Äôs the hope that his future isn‚Äôt doomed because of who he loves.  2) The reason she comforts him is because she validated his heterosexuality. He is cuddling with her and doing things that are stereotypically romantic and that comforts him because it means he can still ‚Äúmask‚Äù (for lack of a better way to put that) his queerness. When he is with her he can pretend that he is not fighting this battle with himself. He can pretend he is what society deems ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  When Selina is killed Batman refers to her as ‚Äúhis last hope.‚Äù   I think my second reading makes sense in this context she was literally his last hope at denying his queerness but with her gone he no longer feels he can hold back what he‚Äôs been dealing with.   Batman is shown resisting what would normally hurt a vampire because he is still ‚Äúpure‚Äù. He hasn‚Äôt tasted blood (had a queer experience). he brings up Selina having selfless love for him she made him stronger. (Side note: that‚Äôs really fucking sweet and I love batman and Selina sm)  This next image made my jaw drop because to me if you replace the word ‚Äúsane‚Äù with perhaps ‚Äúheterosexual‚Äù or ‚Äústraight‚Äù it would make A LOT of sense.   Batman has completely given up on hiding his queerness. There‚Äôs no point in resisting it anymore (was there ever when he knew how this would end eventually?).  I‚Äôll leave a transcription of the cursive in the alt text for these next pages. I feel the experience is a lot better when you read them yourself.  ALTALTALT So yeah Batman describes (very erotically might I add!) sucking the Jokers blood. Literally saying the Joker has WON. And like I feel like this is speaking for itself but I‚Äôll try to describe how I felt while reading.  Batman giving in to something he‚Äôs always wanted and immediately feeling Shame and guilt at what he‚Äôs done. Much like how when things stay in your mind you can deny them but when you act things out (like being queer with someone-) you can no longer deny what you desire. He becomes impure once he sucks Jokers blood so he runs away from all that can hurt him and asks Gordon and Alfred to end him. Because what is he supposed to do now? Live on knowing what he has done what he will become if he keeps going? If it‚Äôs just one person he can destroy the evidence of it ever happening continue to deny what he knows to be true but if there were more? he simply wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay in denial.   I think Joker being the character here too adds so much for me personally (as someone who likes batjokes) because in the literal sense it is Batman giving in to his urge to kill Joker but from a queer standpoint it seems like something entirely different. He hates the Joker but he cant help but give in to this hidden desire he has that has been taking over his mind. It makes so much sense it‚Äôs the Joker because he is his greatest temptation.,2024-07-12 22:52:35 GMT

I think this would not only fit a modern day outlook (I know it‚Äôs mostly Harvey thinking he can no longer be an attorney thanks to the deformity but yknow) but give an external force to Harvey‚Äôs complex thoughts. The scarring isn‚Äôt the catalyst this time  2) in order to find a middle between ‚Äúgood lawyer who had one bad day/bad childhood‚Äù and ‚Äúcorrupt politician‚Äù - how about he‚Äôs an Aaron Burr. Too centrist for city council and the public too goody-two-shoes for the rogues. He secretly uses a coin flip as the final say cause he‚Äôs so indecisive. The public gave him the nickname Two-Face,2024-07-12 21:22:07 GMT

Nightwing couldn‚Äôt be dead. He couldn‚Äôt be.     The building had come down just moments before with Nightwing still inside and now he wasn‚Äôt answering his comm. It had only been a minute or so but to Wally it felt like hours.     He felt like his fingers were falling off as he dug and dug dragging civilians out with the rubble. He could feel his fear turning to panic as each person he found wasn‚Äôt Dick. He couldn‚Äôt be buried that far!     Suddenly he heard static through his comm followed by a quiet ‚Äú‚Ä¶Wally?‚Äù     Wally could‚Äôve cried with relief. Dick was alive. His boyfriend was still breathing. But that didn‚Äôt mean he was unharmed. In fact it was highly likely that he was injured seeing as he had forgotten to use Wally‚Äôs codename. Dick never forgot.     ‚ÄúNightwing? Where are you? Are you okay?‚Äù Wally said shooting out questions before he even knew what he was saying.      ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm stuck. I can‚Äôt move my legs!‚Äù Dick answered sounding panicked.     ‚ÄúNightwing status report‚Äù Wally barked remembering that was something Batman did when Dick was too out of it to answer.      ‚ÄúLegs are pinned definitely broken. I‚Äôm bleeding from‚Ä¶ somewhere I‚Äôm not sure where and definitely a concussion. I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know where I am just that I‚Äôm buried. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù     Man that worked wonders. Wally wondered if there was some code word for every situation.      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay I‚Äôm gonna get you out. Just hang on‚Äù Wally said continuing to dismantle the building. ‚ÄúHow bad are you bleeding?‚Äù     ‚ÄúBad‚Äù Dick answered. Wally‚Äôs heart sank. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs coming from my legs or stomach but it‚Äôs already soaked my back. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm starting to get really dizzy‚Ä¶‚Äù     ‚ÄúNightwing stay awake‚Äù Wally ordered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to find you just keep talking.‚Äù     Wally sped up his movements becoming desperate and frantic. He couldn‚Äôt lose Dick. He‚Äôd lost so many people but losing Dick would break him.      ‚ÄúWalls‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I can stay awake much longer‚Ä¶‚Äù Dick said his voice growing weaker.     ‚ÄúPlease Dick just try!‚Äù Wally shouted dropping the codename to see if Dick would listen better.     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt p-panic but I think ‚Äôm going into shock‚Ä¶‚Äù     Wally panicked. He couldn‚Äôt help it. He had stayed calm as long as possible but Dick‚Äôs voice fading out and the fact that he hadn‚Äôt found him yet was making that impossible. And now that Dick was going into shock he didn‚Äôt have much longer.      What if he couldn‚Äôt get Dick help in time? What if he was too late? What if Dick was already gone when he found him?     After he‚Äôd broken each finger probably six times he saw a flash of familiar black hair. It was Dick.      ‚ÄúDick? I‚Äôm here baby I‚Äôm here‚Äù he said lifting the rubble off of him. What he saw nearly made him freeze up.     Dick‚Äôs face was pale as death too pale to blame on the dust and the blood was just‚Ä¶ everywhere. He had been right though. The blood was coming from a deep puncture wound in his abdomen. He was conscious but only barely.      Wally picked up his boyfriend‚Äôs upper half holding him close and feeling for a heartbeat. When he felt it he let out a breath that he hadn‚Äôt known he was holding. It was weak and way too fast but it was there.      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here now Dickiebird. You‚Äôre gonna be okay‚Äù he said softly through the tears he hadn‚Äôt realized were there.      ‚ÄúHngh‚Äù was all Dick managed to say in response his eyes glazing over.     Wally removed the rubble from Dick‚Äôs legs preparing for the possible bleeding. They were badly broken but thankfully there was no more blood.     ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back babe. Just stay right here‚Äù he said before running off freeing any remaining citizens.      When he returned Dick almost looked worse than when he left.      ‚ÄúDickie? Can you hear me?‚Äù Wally asked. Dick paused for a moment before nodding slowly. ‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôm gonna get you to the cave. You‚Äôre gonna be okay.‚Äù     He planted a kiss on his forehead before speeding off into the night.     //////     Hours later Wally found himself sitting outside the med bay in the bat cave. This was always his least favorite part. Sitting still and waiting. Not knowing if his boyfriend was okay. Not knowing if he would even make it.      Of course he trusted Alfred and Leslie but it was bad this time. Dick‚Äôs body had started to decompensate when Wally had picked him up and he hadn‚Äôt been breathing when he got to the cave. He knew that no news was good news but that didn‚Äôt make the wait any easier.      ‚ÄúMaster Wallace?‚Äù He heard Alfred say startling him out of his thoughts.      ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù He asked eagerly.      ‚ÄúMy apologies. I did not mean to startle you. Anyways Master Dick is now stable and is asking for you‚Äù Alfred said.      Wally‚Äôs body visibly sagged with relief. Dick was alive. Alive and awake enough to ask for him. He wasted no time in following Alfred.      When he saw Dick he could‚Äôve cried. His big blue eyes were open focused and looking right at him. Although he had a mask on he was in fact breathing.      Wally rushed over to him kissing him deeply before Dick could even react.     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not dead‚Äù Wally said crying silently yet laughing with relief.      ‚ÄúHm. Me too‚Äù Dick said tiredly.      ‚ÄúI told you you‚Äôd be okay. Hey he‚Äôs gonna be okay right?‚Äù He Wally asked Alfred.      ‚ÄúIndeed‚Äù Alfred answered. ‚ÄúIt was a close shave but as soon as we got him blood he perked right up.‚Äù     ‚ÄúGood. That‚Äôs good‚Äù he said before burying his face in Dick‚Äôs shoulder.      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be okay Wally‚Ä¶‚Äù Dick said reassuringly. Wally still wasn‚Äôt sure he believed it.     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better be.‚Äù     He held Dick tightly and this time Dick squeezed him back.,2024-07-12 23:56:07 GMT

High above the bustling streets perched on a gargoyle adorning one of the city‚Äôs countless Gothic spires a dark figure surveyed the urban sprawl below. Batman the city‚Äôs vigilant guardian scanned the horizon with eyes that missed nothing.    His comm unit crackled to life. ‚ÄúBatman we‚Äôve got another one‚Äù came the gruff voice of Commissioner Gordon. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna want to see this.‚Äù    Without a word Batman leapt from his perch his cape billowing out behind him as he glided towards the source of the disturbance. The night was young but already it promised to be a long one.    Minutes later he touched down in front of Gotham National Bank where a scene of controlled chaos awaited him. Police cruisers formed a perimeter around the building their lights painting the street in alternating flashes of red and blue. Officers milled about their faces a mix of confusion and grim determination.    Commissioner Gordon stood near the entrance his trench coat pulled tight against the chill. As Batman approached Gordon‚Äôs mustache twitched in a mirthless smile. ‚ÄúGlad you could make it‚Äù he said his voice low. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs‚Ä¶ different.‚Äù    Batman‚Äôs eyes narrowed behind his cowl. ‚ÄúDifferent how?‚Äù    Gordon gestured towards the bank‚Äôs entrance. ‚ÄúSee for yourself.‚Äù    As they stepped inside the acrid smell of gunpowder mingled with something sweeter almost cloying. The bank‚Äôs marble floor was littered with playing cards each one bearing the unmistakable grinning visage of the Joker. But it was the walls that commanded attention.    Written in what appeared to be purple spray paint a message sprawled across the pristine surface:    ‚ÄúIn this den of greed and gold A jester‚Äôs tale begins to unfold. With laughter and chaos I‚Äôll make my mark Gotham‚Äôs new nightmare in the dark.‚Äù    Batman‚Äôs jaw clenched. ‚ÄúThe Joker?‚Äù    Gordon shook his head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing. We know for a fact that the Joker‚Äôs locked up tight in Arkham. This is someone new.‚Äù    As they moved deeper into the bank the extent of the carnage became clear. Bodies lay strewn about their faces frozen in grotesque smiles. But there was something off about them.    Batman knelt beside one of the victims examining the rictus grin. ‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt the Joker‚Äôs usual toxins‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúThe chemical composition is different. More refined.‚Äù    ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù Gordon sighed. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôve got a Joker copycat with an upgraded formula. Any other good news?‚Äù    Batman stood his cape settling around him like a shroud. ‚ÄúThe vault‚Äù he said simply striding towards the massive steel door at the back of the bank.    The vault stood open its contents emptied. But on the inside of the door another message awaited:    ‚ÄúWith rhyme and reason I‚Äôll steal your wealth While Gotham‚Äôs protector grasps at stealth. Can you catch a shadow Dark Knight so brave? Or will my laughter be this city‚Äôs grave?‚Äù    Gordon ran a hand through his graying hair. ‚ÄúPoetry? Since when does the Joker write poetry?‚Äù    ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt‚Äù Batman replied his voice grim. ‚ÄúThis is someone new. Someone who wants us to think it‚Äôs the Joker but is leaving deliberate clues that it isn‚Äôt.‚Äù    As if on cue a bank teller who had been huddling in the corner suddenly sprang to his feet his eyes wild and unfocused. ‚ÄúThe laughter!‚Äù he cried out. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you hear it? It‚Äôs everywhere!‚Äù    Before anyone could react the man began to convulse his body twisting in unnatural angles. And then to the horror of all present he began to laugh. It started as a low chuckle but quickly grew into a full-throated cackle that echoed off the marble walls.    Batman moved swiftly catching the man as he collapsed. But it was too late. The laughter died away leaving only the eerie silence of the crime scene.    ‚ÄúWe need to get these bodies to the lab‚Äù Batman said his voice tight with controlled anger. ‚ÄúAnd I want a full analysis of every chemical trace in this building.‚Äù    Gordon nodded already barking orders to his officers. As the scene buzzed with activity Batman slipped away melting into the shadows of the night.    * * *     In the Batcave the soft hum of computers and the occasional screech of bats provided a backdrop to Bruce Wayne‚Äôs intense concentration. He stood before a large screen cowl pulled back brow furrowed as he pored over the data from the bank heist.    ‚ÄúMaster Bruce‚Äù Alfred‚Äôs cultured tones cut through the silence. ‚ÄúPerhaps a spot of tea might help clear the cobwebs?‚Äù    Bruce turned a ghost of a smile touching his lips. ‚ÄúThanks Alfred but I don‚Äôt think tea is going to solve this one.‚Äù    Alfred set the tray down regardless. ‚ÄúPerhaps not sir but it certainly can‚Äôt hurt. Have you made any progress in identifying our poetic miscreant?‚Äù    Bruce shook his head frustration evident in every line of his body. ‚ÄúThe chemical analysis came back inconclusive. It‚Äôs similar to Joker toxin but with key differences. Whoever created this is brilliant possibly on par with the Joker himself.‚Äù    ‚ÄúA disturbing thought‚Äù Alfred mused. ‚ÄúAnd what of the victims?‚Äù    ‚ÄúAll dead‚Äù Bruce said grimly. ‚ÄúThe new toxin works faster than the Joker‚Äôs and it‚Äôs more potent. But that‚Äôs not the strangest part.‚Äù He pulled up an image on the screen showing a close-up of one of the victim‚Äôs faces. ‚ÄúLook at the musculature around the mouth.‚Äù    Alfred leaned in his eyes widening slightly. ‚ÄúGood heavens. It almost appears as if‚Ä¶‚Äù    ‚ÄúAs if they were trying not to smile‚Äù Bruce finished. ‚ÄúThis toxin doesn‚Äôt just force the victims to laugh. It‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs fighting against their will forcing the body to betray itself.‚Äù    The computer beeped signaling an incoming transmission. Bruce pulled his cowl back on as Commissioner Gordon‚Äôs face appeared on the screen.    ‚ÄúBatman we‚Äôve got another one‚Äù Gordon said without preamble. ‚ÄúGotham Museum of Modern Art. You‚Äôre not going to believe this.‚Äù    ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way‚Äù Batman replied already moving towards the Batmobile.    As the sleek vehicle roared out of the cave Bruce‚Äôs mind raced. Two heists in one night both bearing the hallmarks of the Joker yet undeniably different. Something big was brewing in Gotham and he had a sinking feeling that this was only the beginning.    * * *     The Gotham Museum of Modern Art stood as a beacon of culture amidst the city‚Äôs often grim landscape. Tonight however it was a crime scene that defied explanation.    As Batman approached he immediately noticed something was off. The police lights seemed dimmer than usual and there was an eerie quiet surrounding the building. Commissioner Gordon met him at the entrance his face pale.    ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this‚Äù Gordon said his voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ you have to see it for yourself.‚Äù    They stepped inside and Batman felt a chill that had nothing to do with the night air. The entire museum had been transformed. Every painting every sculpture had been altered to include a twisted grinning face. But it wasn‚Äôt the Joker‚Äôs face ‚Äì it was softer more feminine yet no less terrifying.    And everywhere there was poetry. Lines of verse scrawled across walls floors even across the faces of the altered artworks:    ‚ÄúIn halls of beauty I leave my mark A canvas of chaos a masterpiece dark. Can you solve my riddle oh Dark Knight so grim? Or will Gotham fall to her not to him?‚Äù    Batman‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúHer?‚Äù    Gordon nodded grimly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not all. Follow me.‚Äù    They made their way to the center of the museum where a macabre scene awaited them. The security guards and night staff had been arranged in a grotesque tableau their bodies contorted into unnatural poses faces frozen in those horrible forced smiles. But at the center of it all was something that made even Batman‚Äôs blood run cold.    A woman sat in a chair her body relaxed as if merely resting. But her face ‚Äì her face was a mask of pure terror eyes wide and mouth open in a silent scream. And carved into her forehead were two words: ‚ÄúPoetic Justice.‚Äù    ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs alive‚Äù Gordon said softly. ‚ÄúCatatonic but alive. The only survivor we‚Äôve found so far.‚Äù    Batman knelt beside the woman examining her closely. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt random‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúShe was chosen specifically. But why?‚Äù    As if in answer a nearby screen flickered to life. The face that appeared was hidden behind a mask ‚Äì white with delicate purple lines tracing a feminine face. Red lips curved into a smile that sent chills down the spines of all who saw it.    ‚ÄúHello Gotham‚Äù the figure purred her voice a melodic contralto. ‚ÄúDid you miss me? Oh wait you didn‚Äôt even know I existed did you? Allow me to introduce myself. You can call me‚Ä¶ Ms. Racey Rhymes.‚Äù    She giggled the sound eerily reminiscent of the Joker‚Äôs infamous laugh yet distinctly her own. ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôve enjoyed my little exhibitions so far. Consider them my audition for the role of Gotham‚Äôs new maestro of mayhem. The Joker? Oh he‚Äôs so last season. It‚Äôs time for a new act don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù    Her eyes seemed to lock onto the camera and by extension onto Batman himself. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre watching Dark Knight. Are you intrigued? Puzzled? Oh I do hope so. Because this is just the overture my dear. The real performance is yet to come.‚Äù    She leaned in close her masked face filling the screen. ‚ÄúCan you hear it Batman? The rhythm of chaos the melody of madness? It‚Äôs coming for Gotham and not even you can stop it. So put on your dancing shoes darling. Because when the music starts we‚Äôre all going to dance.‚Äù    The screen went dark leaving the museum in eerie silence.    Batman stood his mind racing. This was unlike anything he had faced before. A new player had entered the game one who combined the Joker‚Äôs flair for the theatrical with a poetic sensibility that was both beautiful and terrifying.    ‚ÄúCommissioner‚Äù he said his voice low and intense ‚ÄúI need everything you have on this woman. Bank records security footage witness statements ‚Äì anything that might give us a clue to her identity or her next move.‚Äù    Gordon nodded already pulling out his phone to make the necessary calls. ‚ÄúWhat are you thinking Batman? Who is she?‚Äù    Batman‚Äôs gaze swept the room taking in the altered artworks the grotesque tableau of bodies the lone survivor with her terrifying message. ‚ÄúSomeone who‚Äôs been watching Gotham for a long time‚Äù he said grimly. ‚ÄúSomeone with resources intelligence and a deep-seated grudge. This isn‚Äôt just about chaos or money. This is personal.‚Äù    As he turned to leave Batman‚Äôs eyes fell on a small card that had fluttered to the ground. He picked it up turning it over in his gloved hand. It was a business card for Maxwell Pride one of Gotham‚Äôs most prominent ‚Äì and controversial ‚Äì business moguls.    ‚ÄúGet me everything you can on Maxwell Pride‚Äù Batman said tucking the card away. ‚ÄúI have a feeling he‚Äôs connected to this somehow.‚Äù    As he stepped out into the night Batman couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that Gotham was standing on the precipice of something truly terrifying. Ms. Racey Rhymes was out there plotting her next move and he had a sinking feeling that this was only the beginning of her twisted poem.    The game was afoot and the stakes had never been higher. As he grappled to the rooftops Batman‚Äôs determination solidified into iron resolve. He would solve this riddle unravel this rhyme and bring Ms. Racey Rhymes to justice ‚Äì before Gotham descended into a chaos from which it might never recover.    *****    The warehouse was a study in contrasts. Outside it blended seamlessly into Gotham‚Äôs industrial district a nondescript building among many. Inside however it was a riot of color and chaos that would have made the Joker himself green with envy.    At the center of this maelstrom sat Ms. Racey Rhymes her feet propped up on an antique desk that looked wildly out of place in the warehouse setting. Her toes painted a vivid purple wiggled slightly as she regarded the man standing before her. To her left and right a pair of muscular goons stood at attention their faces painted with grotesque smiles that didn‚Äôt quite reach their eyes.    Ms. Rhymes herself was a vision of calculated madness. Her hair dyed in alternating streaks of green and purple cascaded over her shoulders. She wore a tailored suit that seemed to shift between deep purple and midnight blue depending on how the light hit it. But it was her face that commanded attention ‚Äì pale as moonlight with lips painted a vivid red and eyes that sparkled with equal parts intelligence and insanity.    ‚ÄúSo‚Äù she purred her voice a melody that danced on the edge of reason ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the infamous Revan. I must say you cut quite the imposing figure.‚Äù    The man before her stood silent his face hidden behind a mask that was featureless save for a pair of narrow eye slits. He wore a long dark trench coat that seemed to absorb the light around it. In his hand he held a baseball bat its surface marred by scratches and what looked suspiciously like bloodstains.    Ms. Rhymes leaned forward her eyes glittering. ‚ÄúNot much for conversation are you? That‚Äôs quite alright. I prefer my hired help to be more‚Ä¶ action-oriented.‚Äù    She snapped her fingers and one of her goons stepped forward placing a thick envelope on the desk. ‚ÄúYour advance‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúHalf now half upon completion. Assuming of course that you‚Äôre up to the task.‚Äù    Revan remained motionless for a moment then reached out and took the envelope. His voice when he finally spoke was a low growl that seemed to emanate from the depths of his mask. ‚ÄúThe task?‚Äù    Ms. Rhymes‚Äô smile widened becoming something feral and dangerous. ‚ÄúWhy bringing me the Batman of course. Alive mind you. I have‚Ä¶ plans for our dear Dark Knight.‚Äù    She stood moving around the desk with a grace that belied the madness in her eyes. ‚ÄúYou see Revan I‚Äôm writing an epic. A poem that will shake Gotham to its very foundations. And Batman? He‚Äôs to be my unwitting co-author.‚Äù    Revan‚Äôs grip tightened on his bat. ‚ÄúBatman has bested many. What makes you think I can succeed where others have failed?‚Äù    Ms. Rhymes laughed the sound echoing off the warehouse walls like broken glass. ‚ÄúOh my dear Revan. That‚Äôs precisely why I chose you. You‚Äôre not like the others are you? No you‚Äôre something‚Ä¶ special.‚Äù    She circled him her bare feet silent on the concrete floor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard the whispers you know. They say you‚Äôre more than just a man. That you‚Äôre something‚Ä¶ darker. A force of nature barely contained in human form.‚Äù    Revan remained still but there was a tension in his posture that suggested coiled power ready to be unleashed. ‚ÄúAnd if the whispers are true?‚Äù    ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre exactly what I need‚Äù Ms. Rhymes said clapping her hands together in delight. ‚ÄúYou see Batman thinks he understands chaos. He believes he‚Äôs seen the depths of madness in his rogues‚Äô gallery. But you and I? We‚Äôre going to show him what true chaos looks like.‚Äù    She returned to her desk pulling out a folder and tossing it to Revan. ‚ÄúEverything we know about the Bat. His patterns his weaknesses the places he frequents. Use it ignore it it matters not to me. All that matters is the result.‚Äù    Revan flipped through the folder his masked face revealing nothing. ‚ÄúAnd when I bring him to you?‚Äù    Ms. Rhymes‚Äô smile was all teeth. ‚ÄúThen my dear Revan the real fun begins. You see I have a little‚Ä¶ gift for our caped crusader. A concoction of my own design that‚Äôs going to open his eyes to a whole new world of possibility.‚Äù    She leaned in close her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ‚ÄúImagine it. Batman the stoic defender of Gotham reduced to a laughing giggling mess. And then just when he thinks he‚Äôs lost everything we‚Äôll rebuild him. In our image.‚Äù    Revan closed the folder. ‚ÄúYou seek to break Batman.‚Äù    ‚ÄúBreak him?‚Äù Ms. Rhymes laughed. ‚ÄúOh no my dear. I seek to remake him. To show Gotham that even its greatest hero can fall. And in doing so to prove that chaos is the only true constant in this mad mad world.‚Äù    She extended her hand. ‚ÄúSo do we have a deal?‚Äù    Revan regarded her for a long moment then grasped her hand in his gloved one. ‚ÄúWe have a deal.‚Äù    As Revan turned to leave Ms. Rhymes called out ‚ÄúOh and Revan? Do try to have fun with it. After all what‚Äôs the point of chaos if you can‚Äôt enjoy the show?‚Äù    The door closed behind Revan leaving Ms. Rhymes alone with her goons. She turned to them her smile never wavering. ‚ÄúBoys I think it‚Äôs time we prepared for our guest. After all we want Batman to feel right at home when he arrives.‚Äù    * * *     Across town in a penthouse apartment that screamed of old money and refined taste two women stood before a wall covered in newspaper clippings photographs and handwritten notes. Hannah Pride her blonde hair pulled back in a severe bun traced a line between two photos with a manicured finger.    ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a pattern here Sarah‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt random attacks. She‚Äôs building to something.‚Äù    Sarah Lawson her dark skin a stark contrast to Hannah‚Äôs paleness leaned in close her breath warm on Hannah‚Äôs neck. ‚ÄúYour father‚Äôs company. It‚Äôs at the center of all this.‚Äù    Hannah turned her blue eyes meeting Sarah‚Äôs brown ones. ‚ÄúI know. And that‚Äôs what worries me. If she‚Äôs targeting Pride Enterprises‚Ä¶‚Äù    ‚ÄúThen your father is in danger‚Äù Sarah finished. She placed a comforting hand on Hannah‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll stop her Han. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here.‚Äù    Hannah‚Äôs lips quirked in a small smile. ‚ÄúRemind me again why we‚Äôre doing this ourselves instead of letting the police handle it?‚Äù    Sarah‚Äôs expression darkened. ‚ÄúBecause the police in this city are either corrupt or incompetent. And because‚Ä¶‚Äù She hesitated.    ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs personal‚Äù Hannah said softly. She reached up cupping Sarah‚Äôs face in her hand. ‚ÄúI know love. I haven‚Äôt forgotten what she did to your sister.‚Äù    Sarah leaned into the touch her eyes closing briefly. ‚ÄúSometimes I think you‚Äôre the only thing keeping me sane through all this.‚Äù    Hannah leaned in pressing a gentle kiss to Sarah‚Äôs lips. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll just have to stick around won‚Äôt I?‚Äù    Their moment was interrupted by the sound of Hannah‚Äôs phone ringing. She pulled away reluctantly fishing the device out of her pocket. Her eyes widened as she saw the caller ID.    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my father‚Äù she said a note of surprise in her voice. She answered the call putting it on speaker. ‚ÄúDad? Is everything alright?‚Äù    Maxwell Pride‚Äôs voice crackled through the speaker tense and strained. ‚ÄúHannah where are you? Are you safe?‚Äù    Hannah and Sarah exchanged worried glances. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at the apartment Dad. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù    ‚ÄúListen to me very carefully‚Äù Maxwell said his words coming in a rush. ‚ÄúYou need to leave Gotham. Now. Take Sarah and go somewhere safe. Don‚Äôt tell anyone where you‚Äôre going not even me.‚Äù    ‚ÄúDad you‚Äôre scaring me‚Äù Hannah said her voice rising. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù    There was a pause filled only with the sound of Maxwell‚Äôs heavy breathing. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs coming for me Hannah. Ms. Racey Rhymes. I‚Ä¶ I think I know who she is. And if I‚Äôm right then none of us are safe.‚Äù    Sarah leaned in close to the phone. ‚ÄúMr. Pride we can help. Hannah and I we‚Äôve been investigating‚Äî‚Äù    ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Maxwell‚Äôs shout was sharp enough to make both women flinch. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get involved in this. It‚Äôs too dangerous. Please just‚Ä¶ just go. I‚Äôll contact you when it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù    The line went dead leaving Hannah and Sarah staring at each other in stunned silence.    ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not leaving‚Äù Sarah said after a moment her jaw set in determination.    Hannah nodded already moving towards their equipment. ‚ÄúNo we‚Äôre not. But we are going to find out what the hell is going on.‚Äù    As they prepared to head out into the Gotham night neither woman noticed the small drone hovering outside their window its camera lens glinting in the moonlight.    * * *     In the Batcave Bruce Wayne stood before his computer array cowl pushed back as he pored over the information displayed on the screens. Alfred approached a tray of coffee in his hands.    ‚ÄúAny progress Master Bruce?‚Äù the butler asked setting the tray down.    Bruce ran a hand through his hair frustration evident in every line of his body. ‚ÄúSome but not enough. I‚Äôve managed to trace the chemical components of Ms. Rhymes‚Äô new toxin to a few possible sources but nothing concrete yet.‚Äù    He pulled up an image on the main screen ‚Äì a molecular diagram of the toxin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs brilliant in a terrifying way. She‚Äôs somehow managed to combine elements of Joker venom with a cocktail of other psychoactive compounds. The result is a toxin that doesn‚Äôt just force its victims to laugh ‚Äì it rewires their entire neural pathways.‚Äù    Alfred leaned in his brow furrowed. ‚ÄúGood heavens. You mean to say this toxin actually changes the way the brain functions?‚Äù    Bruce nodded grimly. ‚ÄúExactly. It‚Äôs not just about inducing euphoria or causing muscle spasms. This toxin fundamentally alters the victim‚Äôs perception of reality. In essence it forces them to see the world through the lens of Ms. Rhymes‚Äô particular brand of madness.‚Äù    ‚ÄúA frightening prospect indeed‚Äù Alfred murmured. ‚ÄúAnd what of the connection to Maxwell Pride?‚Äù    Bruce pulled up another screen this one showing a complex web of financial transactions. ‚ÄúPride Enterprises has its fingers in a lot of pies Alfred. Pharmaceuticals chemical research even some experimental psychology studies. Any one of these could be the link we‚Äôre looking for.‚Äù    He zoomed in on one particular node in the web. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something else. About five years ago Pride Enterprises funded a series of poetry workshops for ‚Äòat-risk youth‚Äô. It was a pet project of Maxwell‚Äôs wife Elizabeth.‚Äù    Alfred raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou suspect our Ms. Rhymes might have been a participant in these workshops?‚Äù    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a possibility‚Äù Bruce said. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs more. Three years ago Elizabeth Pride died under mysterious circumstances. The official report says it was an accident but‚Ä¶‚Äù    ‚ÄúBut you suspect foul play‚Äù Alfred finished.    Bruce nodded. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt shake the feeling that Elizabeth‚Äôs death is somehow connected to all this. The timing the way Ms. Rhymes seems to have a personal vendetta against Pride Enterprises ‚Äì it all fits.‚Äù    The computer beeped signaling an incoming transmission. Bruce quickly pulled his cowl back on as Commissioner Gordon‚Äôs face appeared on the screen.    ‚ÄúBatman we‚Äôve got a situation‚Äù Gordon said without preamble. ‚ÄúMaxwell Pride just reached out to us. Says he‚Äôs got information on our mysterious Ms. Rhymes. He‚Äôs requesting protection.‚Äù    Batman‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúWhere is he now?‚Äù    ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing‚Äù Gordon said his voice tight with concern. ‚ÄúHe was supposed to meet us at GCPD headquarters twenty minutes ago. He never showed.‚Äù    Batman was already moving towards the Batmobile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on it Commissioner. Send me everything you have on Pride‚Äôs last known whereabouts.‚Äù    As the vehicle roared to life Bruce couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that they were rapidly approaching a tipping point. Ms. Racey Rhymes had made her opening moves and now the game was escalating. And somewhere out there Maxwell Pride held pieces of the puzzle that could blow this whole case wide open.    The Batmobile tore out of the cave and into the Gotham night. The hunt was on and Batman knew that every second counted. Because in this deadly game of poetry and madness the next rhyme could very well be Gotham‚Äôs last.    ****    The Gotham night was thick with tension as Batman raced through the streets his mind working overtime to piece together the puzzle of Ms. Racey Rhymes and her connection to Maxwell Pride. The Batmobile‚Äôs engine roared a counterpoint to the eerie silence that had fallen over the city.    Suddenly a dark figure stepped out into the street directly in the Batmobile‚Äôs path. Batman slammed on the brakes the vehicle screeching to a halt mere inches from the imposing silhouette.    As Batman emerged from the Batmobile he found himself face to face with Revan. The masked hitman stood motionless his baseball bat held loosely at his side.    ‚ÄúSo‚Äù Batman growled ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the new player in town.‚Äù    Revan‚Äôs voice was a low rumble. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre the one they call the Dark Knight. I‚Äôve been waiting for you.‚Äù    Without warning Revan lunged forward his bat whistling through the air. Batman barely had time to dodge the weapon grazing his cowl as he rolled to the side.    ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for this‚Äù Batman snarled rising to his feet. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Maxwell Pride?‚Äù    Revan chuckled a sound devoid of humor. ‚ÄúAlways so focused on the mission aren‚Äôt you? But tell me Batman when was the last time you faced a true challenge?‚Äù    The two circled each other tension crackling in the air between them. Batman‚Äôs eyes narrowed behind his cowl. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre working for Ms. Rhymes. Why?‚Äù    ‚ÄúWhy does anyone do anything in this city?‚Äù Revan replied twirling his bat with deadly grace. ‚ÄúFor the thrill of the game.‚Äù    With that he attacked again his movements a blur of speed and precision. Batman found himself on the defensive blocking and parrying blows that came with frightening force. It quickly became clear that Revan was no ordinary thug ‚Äì his fighting style was a mix of various martial arts executed with a samurai-like discipline.    As they fought the battle moved through the streets of Gotham each combatant using the urban landscape to their advantage. Batman grappled to a nearby rooftop hoping to gain the high ground but Revan was right behind him scaling the building with inhuman agility.    ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt run from chaos Batman‚Äù Revan called out his voice carrying over the sound of their combat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs coming for Gotham whether you‚Äôre ready or not.‚Äù    Batman gritted his teeth launching a flurry of batarangs that Revan deflected with ease. ‚ÄúChaos is just another word for fear‚Äù he retorted. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt scare easily.‚Äù    Their battle continued across the Gotham skyline a deadly dance of shadows and skill. For every move Batman made Revan seemed to have a counter. It was like fighting a dark mirror of himself and for the first time in a long while Batman felt a flicker of doubt.    Meanwhile across town the Gotham City Police Department headquarters was a hive of activity. Commissioner Gordon stood in the center of the chaos barking orders and trying to coordinate the search for Maxwell Pride.    ‚ÄúI want every available unit out there!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúPride is our key to unraveling this whole mess and I‚Äôll be damned if we lose him now!‚Äù    Suddenly the lights in the station flickered and died plunging the building into darkness. A moment later emergency generators kicked in bathing everything in an eerie red glow.    ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Gordon muttered reaching for his gun.    The answer came in the form of a melodic laugh that seemed to emanate from everywhere at once. ‚ÄúOh Commissioner‚Äù Ms. Racey Rhymes‚Äô voice purred over the station‚Äôs PA system. ‚ÄúDid you really think your little fortress could keep me out?‚Äù    Before anyone could react the windows exploded inward showering the room with glass. Smoke grenades rolled across the floor filling the air with thick purplish smoke. As officers coughed and stumbled shadowy figures moved through the haze ‚Äì Ms. Rhymes‚Äô goons their painted smiles visible even through the smoke.    ‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen of Gotham‚Äôs finest‚Äù Ms. Rhymes‚Äô voice rang out again tinged with manic glee. ‚ÄúWelcome to the next act of our little drama. I do hope you‚Äôre ready for a show-stopping performance!‚Äù    Outside the police station Hannah and Sarah arrived just in time to see the chaos unfolding. They exchanged a determined look before pulling on their own masks ‚Äì simple domino masks that concealed their identities without hampering their vision.    ‚ÄúReady?‚Äù Hannah asked her voice tight with tension.    Sarah nodded pulling out a pair of escrima sticks. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs show these clowns what real justice looks like.‚Äù    Back across town Batman and Revan‚Äôs battle had reached a fever pitch. Both combatants were showing signs of fatigue but neither was willing to give an inch. They stood on opposite ends of a rooftop each assessing the other with newfound respect.    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good‚Äù Batman admitted his breath coming in ragged gasps. ‚ÄúBut this ends now. I won‚Äôt let Gotham fall to madness.‚Äù    Revan tilted his head his mask betraying no emotion. ‚ÄúWho said anything about letting Gotham fall? This isn‚Äôt about destruction Batman. It‚Äôs about transformation.‚Äù    Before Batman could respond a new voice cut through the night. ‚ÄúWell done Revan darling. You‚Äôve played your part beautifully.‚Äù    Both men turned to see Ms. Racey Rhymes standing on a nearby rooftop flanked by her grinning goons. She held a sleek high-tech rifle in her hands aimed squarely at Batman.    ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù Revan demanded a note of anger creeping into his voice.    Ms. Rhymes laughed the sound sending chills down Batman‚Äôs spine. ‚ÄúOh my dear Revan. Did you really think I‚Äôd entrust the capture of the Bat to anyone but myself? You were the distraction darling. The opening act to my grand finale.‚Äù    With that she fired. Batman still reeling from his battle with Revan couldn‚Äôt dodge in time. The dart struck him in the shoulder and almost immediately he felt his limbs growing heavy.    ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Revan shouted moving to intercept but it was too late. Batman stumbled fighting against the potent tranquilizer coursing through his system.    As darkness closed in around him the last thing Batman saw was Ms. Rhymes‚Äô triumphant smile and Revan‚Äôs clenched fists.    At the police station the battle was in full swing. Hannah and Sarah had managed to fight their way inside their skills a match for Ms. Rhymes‚Äô thugs. They moved in perfect sync covering each other‚Äôs blind spots and taking down goon after goon.    ‚ÄúWe need to find Gordon!‚Äù Sarah shouted over the chaos.    Hannah nodded ducking under a wild swing from one of the attackers. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be in the thick of it. Come on!‚Äù    They fought their way deeper into the station the air thick with smoke and the sound of combat. Finally they spotted Commissioner Gordon back-to-back with a handful of officers holding off a group of Ms. Rhymes‚Äô more heavily armed thugs.    ‚ÄúCommissioner!‚Äù Hannah called out. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to help!‚Äù    Gordon‚Äôs eyes widened as he saw the masked women cutting through the chaos. ‚ÄúWho the hell are you?‚Äù    ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù Sarah replied simply her escrima sticks a blur as she took down two attackers in quick succession.    With Hannah and Sarah‚Äôs help the tide began to turn. Ms. Rhymes‚Äô goons facing unexpected resistance began to fall back.    Suddenly Ms. Rhymes‚Äô voice crackled over the PA system once more. ‚ÄúWell well well. It seems our little party has some uninvited guests. How delightfully chaotic! But I‚Äôm afraid I must cut this performance short. I have a very important date with a certain Bat you see.‚Äù    The remaining thugs began a coordinated retreat covering their exit with more smoke grenades. As the air cleared Gordon Hannah and Sarah found themselves standing in the wreckage of the police station.    ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre getting away!‚Äù Sarah growled moving towards the exit.    But Hannah grabbed her arm holding her back. ‚ÄúWait. Listen.‚Äù    In the distance they could hear the wail of approaching sirens. ‚ÄúBackup‚Äù Gordon said a note of relief in his voice. ‚ÄúAbout damn time.‚Äù    Hannah turned to the Commissioner. ‚ÄúWe need to go after Ms. Rhymes. She said something about Batman ‚Äì I think he might be in trouble.‚Äù    Gordon hesitated for a moment then nodded. ‚ÄúGo. I‚Äôll coordinate things here and join you as soon as I can. But be careful ‚Äì this woman is more dangerous than anyone we‚Äôve faced before.‚Äù    As Hannah and Sarah raced out into the night following the trail of Ms. Rhymes‚Äô retreat a new player entered the scene. Revan his posture radiating barely contained fury landed on a nearby rooftop.    ‚ÄúYou‚Äù he growled spotting Hannah and Sarah. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre after Rhymes.‚Äù    The two women tensed ready for another fight but Revan held up a hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to stop you. Rhymes‚Ä¶ she betrayed the code. Used me as a pawn in her game. That cannot stand.‚Äù    Sarah‚Äôs eyes narrowed behind her mask. ‚ÄúWhy should we trust you?‚Äù    ‚ÄúBecause right now I‚Äôm your best chance at finding Batman before it‚Äôs too late‚Äù Revan replied. ‚ÄúRhymes has him and whatever she‚Äôs planning it won‚Äôt be pleasant.‚Äù    Hannah and Sarah exchanged a look years of partnership allowing them to communicate without words. Finally Hannah nodded. ‚ÄúAlright. But one wrong move and you‚Äôll regret it.‚Äù    Revan inclined his head in acknowledgment. ‚ÄúUnderstood. Now come ‚Äì we have a Bat to save and a poet to silence.‚Äù    As the unlikely trio set off in pursuit of Ms. Racey Rhymes the Gotham night seemed to hold its breath. The game had changed alliances shifted and the fate of the city hung in the balance.    In a hidden location deep in the bowels of Gotham Batman slowly regained consciousness. He found himself strapped to a chair his utility belt gone surrounded by an array of strange machinery. And there perched on a ornate throne-like chair sat Ms. Racey Rhymes her eyes gleaming with manic glee.    ‚ÄúWelcome back to the land of the living my dear Dark Knight‚Äù she purred. ‚ÄúOh the poem we‚Äôre going to write together‚Ä¶ it will be a masterpiece that will reshape Gotham forever.‚Äù    As Batman struggled against his bonds he realized with growing dread that this was only the beginning of Ms. Racey Rhymes‚Äô twisted performance. The real show it seemed was about to begin.,2024-07-12 23:40:06 GMT

78,Batman,['the joker'  'batjokes'  'the batman'  'bruce wayne'  'queer subtext'  'queer coding'  'batman comics'  'batman: bloodstorm'],extendedtimeline,Batman: Bloodstorm &amp; Queerness READ: this has been posted on twitter aswell so if you find that it‚Äôs me lol! This will be an even longer version of that with more description as I don‚Äôt have the pesky world limit here! I wanted to start this out by saying I may get some things wrong and this was something I‚Äôd originally had posted on a Mastodon Server my friends are running so I wasn‚Äôt checking it over very much just wanted to get my thoughts out! There are probably a lot of different ways this comic can be read but I‚Äôm particularly enamored by queer readings of comics so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be focusing on today. This won‚Äôt be exhaustive on the queer metaphors in this comic and I‚Äôd be happy for people to add on to what I say! I‚Äôm not an expert on making analysis posts so forgive me if anything is unclear or out of place. I‚Äôm also getting used to Tumblr formatting but fans here tend to be more active so I really wanted to share here! With that let‚Äôs get into it  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Brief Summary Before getting into my reading I thought it best to give a (semi-) brief Summary of the comic itself. There‚Äôs also someone context from the previous comic (as this is part of a trilogy!) that I‚Äôll try to provide too but a lot of the material I‚Äôll talk about isn‚Äôt really dependent on the fact you have the experience of reading Red Rain.   In ‚ÄúBatman: Bloodstorm‚Äù Bruce has been turned into a vampire (the previous comic delves into how this happened but just know he‚Äôs sort of shed the identity of ‚ÄúBruce Wayne‚Äù and has given in to being Batman more ‚Äúfull time‚Äù). Batman finds out there are vampires he has not ‚Äúkilled‚Äù yet (as he had killed a large sum of them in Red Rain)(Because Vampires are undead he does not consider it murder to take them out). While he hunts these vamps down he is heavily resisting the urge to suck blood and because he has resisted it he is getting progressively weaker to the point it‚Äôs hard to do much of anything. In the first comic Tanya (a vampire woman he had become friends with) had synthesized this replacement for blood that would keep her alive and well without the need to kill. Bruce tries to recreate this but it‚Äôs not enough for him and he continues to become weaker the most he resists sucking blood.  While this is happening Joker has started working with the vampires LOL he‚Äôs just being Joker using his charm and stuff to get them to comply.   Cut to Selina who we see get attacked by a werewolf like creature and she becomes a werecat from this attack (I‚Äôd like to note the way this was framed it very much reads like sexual assault). She intends to get her male attacker back for what he did to her.  Selina attacks Batman believing him to be the man but they clear it up fast that he is not. She wants to help him but in Batman fashion he denies her help.   There‚Äôs this woman who Batman has been going to trying to gain information on these super natural occurrings. He asks her if it‚Äôs possible for him to survive when he doesn‚Äôt drink blood and asks what an alternative may be. She basically says GET A BITCH! (he needs the loving touch of a woman or something)   When he runs away from the woman Selina finds him and takes him to her apartment where they cuddle until morning and he DOES feel better after this. Like a considerable amount. He feels like his weakness is going away. So he lets her in on his scheme to catch the Joker and the rest of the vamps. They go to find them and take them down.  During the scuffle Joker shoots Selina with an arrow and she‚Äôs killed. Batman filled with rage finally gives in to his urge to suck blood and he sucks the Jokers blood. Making sure to take the necessary precautions afterwards to ensure Joker doesn‚Äôt come back to life as a vampire.   In this world if you suck blood you become impure and start to have reactions to stereotypical vampire deterrents. Batman believes himself to be unsafe now that he‚Äôs sucked blood and tasks Gordan and Alfred with killing him.  How is this queer? In this section we will operate under the assumption queerness and vampirism are inherently intertwined in this story. That is to say vampirism is just a stand in for queerness or queer experiences. Vampires and vampire media has been queercoded and littered with queer subtext for DECADES. I recommend reading up on it or if you‚Äôre into Video Essays I really enjoyed this video about the bisexualness of Dracula specifically!  In these next images Batman is talking to another vampire about his vampirism (or more like the Vampire is talking AT him and Batman tries to deny it).   Batman says that he does NOT drink blood and the way the vampire responds seems almost erotic lol? He tells Batman that he knows he WANTS to drink blood and that sooner or later he‚Äôll just have to give in to it. Again batman denies denies denies but it‚Äôs because he knows it to be TRUE the desire is only getting stronger.   The vampire calls him a ‚Äúfilthy blood junkie‚Äù (to me this seems akin to calling a queer person ‚Äúfaggot‚Äù perhaps). The way he says that the vampirism is just ‚Äútempting the natural predator in him.‚Äù struck me as a way of saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôve always been queer but the urge (to do something about it) is undeniable now so what are you going to do about it?‚Äù The vampire goes on to say he used to HATE the site of blood (perhaps that he used to hate his own queerness and hid from it) but now that he‚Äôs a vampire he craves it. It gives him satisfaction exactly what he needs he can‚Äôt get enough of it.   This whole interaction reads (to me) as this man describing his queer awakening to Batman connecting his own experience to Batmans recognizing the signs. But Batman doesn‚Äôt believe this. He doesn‚Äôt WANT to give in.   These next images I share focus on Batman denying himself blood.  He describes how he‚Äôs become addicted to the idea of something he‚Äôs never even had before. This resonated with me when you‚Äôre discovering your queerness it seems a lot bigger than it is (bc being queer would be something easy if there weren‚Äôt societal pressures) and craving to have this experience you‚Äôve never gotten. He seems afraid of himself. He sees himself as a predator as someone people should fear. He doesn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äútempted‚Äù by Alfred. I dont think he‚Äôd ever do anything to Alfred here in a queer reading I‚Äôd say this is the result of being told by people that you are predatory for who you love and it becoming so Ingrained in your sense of self you BELIEVE it.   Next I want to touch on WHY Bruce is so comforted by Selina. Why she literally makes him stronger I have two ways I think this could be taken in my reading.   After cuddling with Selina all night Batman feels MUCH better. He is getting his strength back just from being near her.  1) This is an interpretation I think is sweet above anything else that I was thinking about while reading. Selina is a werecat Batman is a vampire. They can relate to eachother. They‚Äôre both queer. They‚Äôre both feared for something they cannot control. The reason Batman finds comfort in Selina is because she is his community. Living in places where there aren‚Äôt a lot of openly queer people finding another queer person is a major comfort. You feel less alone. She is giving him something he‚Äôs desperately needed and that‚Äôs the hope that his future isn‚Äôt doomed because of who he loves.  2) The reason she comforts him is because she validated his heterosexuality. He is cuddling with her and doing things that are stereotypically romantic and that comforts him because it means he can still ‚Äúmask‚Äù (for lack of a better way to put that) his queerness. When he is with her he can pretend that he is not fighting this battle with himself. He can pretend he is what society deems ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  When Selina is killed Batman refers to her as ‚Äúhis last hope.‚Äù   I think my second reading makes sense in this context she was literally his last hope at denying his queerness but with her gone he no longer feels he can hold back what he‚Äôs been dealing with.   Batman is shown resisting what would normally hurt a vampire because he is still ‚Äúpure‚Äù. He hasn‚Äôt tasted blood (had a queer experience). he brings up Selina having selfless love for him she made him stronger. (Side note: that‚Äôs really fucking sweet and I love batman and Selina sm)  This next image made my jaw drop because to me if you replace the word ‚Äúsane‚Äù with perhaps ‚Äúheterosexual‚Äù or ‚Äústraight‚Äù it would make A LOT of sense.   Batman has completely given up on hiding his queerness. There‚Äôs no point in resisting it anymore (was there ever when he knew how this would end eventually?).  I‚Äôll leave a transcription of the cursive in the alt text for these next pages. I feel the experience is a lot better when you read them yourself.  ALTALTALT So yeah Batman describes (very erotically might I add!) sucking the Jokers blood. Literally saying the Joker has WON. And like I feel like this is speaking for itself but I‚Äôll try to describe how I felt while reading.  Batman giving in to something he‚Äôs always wanted and immediately feeling Shame and guilt at what he‚Äôs done. Much like how when things stay in your mind you can deny them but when you act things out (like being queer with someone-) you can no longer deny what you desire. He becomes impure once he sucks Jokers blood so he runs away from all that can hurt him and asks Gordon and Alfred to end him. Because what is he supposed to do now? Live on knowing what he has done what he will become if he keeps going? If it‚Äôs just one person he can destroy the evidence of it ever happening continue to deny what he knows to be true but if there were more? he simply wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay in denial.   I think Joker being the character here too adds so much for me personally (as someone who likes batjokes) because in the literal sense it is Batman giving in to his urge to kill Joker but from a queer standpoint it seems like something entirely different. He hates the Joker but he cant help but give in to this hidden desire he has that has been taking over his mind. It makes so much sense it‚Äôs the Joker because he is his greatest temptation.,2024-07-12 22:52:35 GMT

Nightwing couldn‚Äôt be dead. He couldn‚Äôt be.     The building had come down just moments before with Nightwing still inside and now he wasn‚Äôt answering his comm. It had only been a minute or so but to Wally it felt like hours.     He felt like his fingers were falling off as he dug and dug dragging civilians out with the rubble. He could feel his fear turning to panic as each person he found wasn‚Äôt Dick. He couldn‚Äôt be buried that far!     Suddenly he heard static through his comm followed by a quiet ‚Äú‚Ä¶Wally?‚Äù     Wally could‚Äôve cried with relief. Dick was alive. His boyfriend was still breathing. But that didn‚Äôt mean he was unharmed. In fact it was highly likely that he was injured seeing as he had forgotten to use Wally‚Äôs codename. Dick never forgot.     ‚ÄúNightwing? Where are you? Are you okay?‚Äù Wally said shooting out questions before he even knew what he was saying.      ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm stuck. I can‚Äôt move my legs!‚Äù Dick answered sounding panicked.     ‚ÄúNightwing status report‚Äù Wally barked remembering that was something Batman did when Dick was too out of it to answer.      ‚ÄúLegs are pinned definitely broken. I‚Äôm bleeding from‚Ä¶ somewhere I‚Äôm not sure where and definitely a concussion. I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know where I am just that I‚Äôm buried. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù     Man that worked wonders. Wally wondered if there was some code word for every situation.      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay I‚Äôm gonna get you out. Just hang on‚Äù Wally said continuing to dismantle the building. ‚ÄúHow bad are you bleeding?‚Äù     ‚ÄúBad‚Äù Dick answered. Wally‚Äôs heart sank. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs coming from my legs or stomach but it‚Äôs already soaked my back. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm starting to get really dizzy‚Ä¶‚Äù     ‚ÄúNightwing stay awake‚Äù Wally ordered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to find you just keep talking.‚Äù     Wally sped up his movements becoming desperate and frantic. He couldn‚Äôt lose Dick. He‚Äôd lost so many people but losing Dick would break him.      ‚ÄúWalls‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I can stay awake much longer‚Ä¶‚Äù Dick said his voice growing weaker.     ‚ÄúPlease Dick just try!‚Äù Wally shouted dropping the codename to see if Dick would listen better.     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt p-panic but I think ‚Äôm going into shock‚Ä¶‚Äù     Wally panicked. He couldn‚Äôt help it. He had stayed calm as long as possible but Dick‚Äôs voice fading out and the fact that he hadn‚Äôt found him yet was making that impossible. And now that Dick was going into shock he didn‚Äôt have much longer.      What if he couldn‚Äôt get Dick help in time? What if he was too late? What if Dick was already gone when he found him?     After he‚Äôd broken each finger probably six times he saw a flash of familiar black hair. It was Dick.      ‚ÄúDick? I‚Äôm here baby I‚Äôm here‚Äù he said lifting the rubble off of him. What he saw nearly made him freeze up.     Dick‚Äôs face was pale as death too pale to blame on the dust and the blood was just‚Ä¶ everywhere. He had been right though. The blood was coming from a deep puncture wound in his abdomen. He was conscious but only barely.      Wally picked up his boyfriend‚Äôs upper half holding him close and feeling for a heartbeat. When he felt it he let out a breath that he hadn‚Äôt known he was holding. It was weak and way too fast but it was there.      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here now Dickiebird. You‚Äôre gonna be okay‚Äù he said softly through the tears he hadn‚Äôt realized were there.      ‚ÄúHngh‚Äù was all Dick managed to say in response his eyes glazing over.     Wally removed the rubble from Dick‚Äôs legs preparing for the possible bleeding. They were badly broken but thankfully there was no more blood.     ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back babe. Just stay right here‚Äù he said before running off freeing any remaining citizens.      When he returned Dick almost looked worse than when he left.      ‚ÄúDickie? Can you hear me?‚Äù Wally asked. Dick paused for a moment before nodding slowly. ‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôm gonna get you to the cave. You‚Äôre gonna be okay.‚Äù     He planted a kiss on his forehead before speeding off into the night.     //////     Hours later Wally found himself sitting outside the med bay in the bat cave. This was always his least favorite part. Sitting still and waiting. Not knowing if his boyfriend was okay. Not knowing if he would even make it.      Of course he trusted Alfred and Leslie but it was bad this time. Dick‚Äôs body had started to decompensate when Wally had picked him up and he hadn‚Äôt been breathing when he got to the cave. He knew that no news was good news but that didn‚Äôt make the wait any easier.      ‚ÄúMaster Wallace?‚Äù He heard Alfred say startling him out of his thoughts.      ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù He asked eagerly.      ‚ÄúMy apologies. I did not mean to startle you. Anyways Master Dick is now stable and is asking for you‚Äù Alfred said.      Wally‚Äôs body visibly sagged with relief. Dick was alive. Alive and awake enough to ask for him. He wasted no time in following Alfred.      When he saw Dick he could‚Äôve cried. His big blue eyes were open focused and looking right at him. Although he had a mask on he was in fact breathing.      Wally rushed over to him kissing him deeply before Dick could even react.     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not dead‚Äù Wally said crying silently yet laughing with relief.      ‚ÄúHm. Me too‚Äù Dick said tiredly.      ‚ÄúI told you you‚Äôd be okay. Hey he‚Äôs gonna be okay right?‚Äù He Wally asked Alfred.      ‚ÄúIndeed‚Äù Alfred answered. ‚ÄúIt was a close shave but as soon as we got him blood he perked right up.‚Äù     ‚ÄúGood. That‚Äôs good‚Äù he said before burying his face in Dick‚Äôs shoulder.      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be okay Wally‚Ä¶‚Äù Dick said reassuringly. Wally still wasn‚Äôt sure he believed it.     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better be.‚Äù     He held Dick tightly and this time Dick squeezed him back.,2024-07-12 23:56:07 GMT

High above the bustling streets perched on a gargoyle adorning one of the city‚Äôs countless Gothic spires a dark figure surveyed the urban sprawl below. Batman the city‚Äôs vigilant guardian scanned the horizon with eyes that missed nothing.    His comm unit crackled to life. ‚ÄúBatman we‚Äôve got another one‚Äù came the gruff voice of Commissioner Gordon. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna want to see this.‚Äù    Without a word Batman leapt from his perch his cape billowing out behind him as he glided towards the source of the disturbance. The night was young but already it promised to be a long one.    Minutes later he touched down in front of Gotham National Bank where a scene of controlled chaos awaited him. Police cruisers formed a perimeter around the building their lights painting the street in alternating flashes of red and blue. Officers milled about their faces a mix of confusion and grim determination.    Commissioner Gordon stood near the entrance his trench coat pulled tight against the chill. As Batman approached Gordon‚Äôs mustache twitched in a mirthless smile. ‚ÄúGlad you could make it‚Äù he said his voice low. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs‚Ä¶ different.‚Äù    Batman‚Äôs eyes narrowed behind his cowl. ‚ÄúDifferent how?‚Äù    Gordon gestured towards the bank‚Äôs entrance. ‚ÄúSee for yourself.‚Äù    As they stepped inside the acrid smell of gunpowder mingled with something sweeter almost cloying. The bank‚Äôs marble floor was littered with playing cards each one bearing the unmistakable grinning visage of the Joker. But it was the walls that commanded attention.    Written in what appeared to be purple spray paint a message sprawled across the pristine surface:    ‚ÄúIn this den of greed and gold A jester‚Äôs tale begins to unfold. With laughter and chaos I‚Äôll make my mark Gotham‚Äôs new nightmare in the dark.‚Äù    Batman‚Äôs jaw clenched. ‚ÄúThe Joker?‚Äù    Gordon shook his head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing. We know for a fact that the Joker‚Äôs locked up tight in Arkham. This is someone new.‚Äù    As they moved deeper into the bank the extent of the carnage became clear. Bodies lay strewn about their faces frozen in grotesque smiles. But there was something off about them.    Batman knelt beside one of the victims examining the rictus grin. ‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt the Joker‚Äôs usual toxins‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúThe chemical composition is different. More refined.‚Äù    ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù Gordon sighed. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôve got a Joker copycat with an upgraded formula. Any other good news?‚Äù    Batman stood his cape settling around him like a shroud. ‚ÄúThe vault‚Äù he said simply striding towards the massive steel door at the back of the bank.    The vault stood open its contents emptied. But on the inside of the door another message awaited:    ‚ÄúWith rhyme and reason I‚Äôll steal your wealth While Gotham‚Äôs protector grasps at stealth. Can you catch a shadow Dark Knight so brave? Or will my laughter be this city‚Äôs grave?‚Äù    Gordon ran a hand through his graying hair. ‚ÄúPoetry? Since when does the Joker write poetry?‚Äù    ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt‚Äù Batman replied his voice grim. ‚ÄúThis is someone new. Someone who wants us to think it‚Äôs the Joker but is leaving deliberate clues that it isn‚Äôt.‚Äù    As if on cue a bank teller who had been huddling in the corner suddenly sprang to his feet his eyes wild and unfocused. ‚ÄúThe laughter!‚Äù he cried out. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you hear it? It‚Äôs everywhere!‚Äù    Before anyone could react the man began to convulse his body twisting in unnatural angles. And then to the horror of all present he began to laugh. It started as a low chuckle but quickly grew into a full-throated cackle that echoed off the marble walls.    Batman moved swiftly catching the man as he collapsed. But it was too late. The laughter died away leaving only the eerie silence of the crime scene.    ‚ÄúWe need to get these bodies to the lab‚Äù Batman said his voice tight with controlled anger. ‚ÄúAnd I want a full analysis of every chemical trace in this building.‚Äù    Gordon nodded already barking orders to his officers. As the scene buzzed with activity Batman slipped away melting into the shadows of the night.    * * *     In the Batcave the soft hum of computers and the occasional screech of bats provided a backdrop to Bruce Wayne‚Äôs intense concentration. He stood before a large screen cowl pulled back brow furrowed as he pored over the data from the bank heist.    ‚ÄúMaster Bruce‚Äù Alfred‚Äôs cultured tones cut through the silence. ‚ÄúPerhaps a spot of tea might help clear the cobwebs?‚Äù    Bruce turned a ghost of a smile touching his lips. ‚ÄúThanks Alfred but I don‚Äôt think tea is going to solve this one.‚Äù    Alfred set the tray down regardless. ‚ÄúPerhaps not sir but it certainly can‚Äôt hurt. Have you made any progress in identifying our poetic miscreant?‚Äù    Bruce shook his head frustration evident in every line of his body. ‚ÄúThe chemical analysis came back inconclusive. It‚Äôs similar to Joker toxin but with key differences. Whoever created this is brilliant possibly on par with the Joker himself.‚Äù    ‚ÄúA disturbing thought‚Äù Alfred mused. ‚ÄúAnd what of the victims?‚Äù    ‚ÄúAll dead‚Äù Bruce said grimly. ‚ÄúThe new toxin works faster than the Joker‚Äôs and it‚Äôs more potent. But that‚Äôs not the strangest part.‚Äù He pulled up an image on the screen showing a close-up of one of the victim‚Äôs faces. ‚ÄúLook at the musculature around the mouth.‚Äù    Alfred leaned in his eyes widening slightly. ‚ÄúGood heavens. It almost appears as if‚Ä¶‚Äù    ‚ÄúAs if they were trying not to smile‚Äù Bruce finished. ‚ÄúThis toxin doesn‚Äôt just force the victims to laugh. It‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs fighting against their will forcing the body to betray itself.‚Äù    The computer beeped signaling an incoming transmission. Bruce pulled his cowl back on as Commissioner Gordon‚Äôs face appeared on the screen.    ‚ÄúBatman we‚Äôve got another one‚Äù Gordon said without preamble. ‚ÄúGotham Museum of Modern Art. You‚Äôre not going to believe this.‚Äù    ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way‚Äù Batman replied already moving towards the Batmobile.    As the sleek vehicle roared out of the cave Bruce‚Äôs mind raced. Two heists in one night both bearing the hallmarks of the Joker yet undeniably different. Something big was brewing in Gotham and he had a sinking feeling that this was only the beginning.    * * *     The Gotham Museum of Modern Art stood as a beacon of culture amidst the city‚Äôs often grim landscape. Tonight however it was a crime scene that defied explanation.    As Batman approached he immediately noticed something was off. The police lights seemed dimmer than usual and there was an eerie quiet surrounding the building. Commissioner Gordon met him at the entrance his face pale.    ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this‚Äù Gordon said his voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ you have to see it for yourself.‚Äù    They stepped inside and Batman felt a chill that had nothing to do with the night air. The entire museum had been transformed. Every painting every sculpture had been altered to include a twisted grinning face. But it wasn‚Äôt the Joker‚Äôs face ‚Äì it was softer more feminine yet no less terrifying.    And everywhere there was poetry. Lines of verse scrawled across walls floors even across the faces of the altered artworks:    ‚ÄúIn halls of beauty I leave my mark A canvas of chaos a masterpiece dark. Can you solve my riddle oh Dark Knight so grim? Or will Gotham fall to her not to him?‚Äù    Batman‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúHer?‚Äù    Gordon nodded grimly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not all. Follow me.‚Äù    They made their way to the center of the museum where a macabre scene awaited them. The security guards and night staff had been arranged in a grotesque tableau their bodies contorted into unnatural poses faces frozen in those horrible forced smiles. But at the center of it all was something that made even Batman‚Äôs blood run cold.    A woman sat in a chair her body relaxed as if merely resting. But her face ‚Äì her face was a mask of pure terror eyes wide and mouth open in a silent scream. And carved into her forehead were two words: ‚ÄúPoetic Justice.‚Äù    ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs alive‚Äù Gordon said softly. ‚ÄúCatatonic but alive. The only survivor we‚Äôve found so far.‚Äù    Batman knelt beside the woman examining her closely. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt random‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúShe was chosen specifically. But why?‚Äù    As if in answer a nearby screen flickered to life. The face that appeared was hidden behind a mask ‚Äì white with delicate purple lines tracing a feminine face. Red lips curved into a smile that sent chills down the spines of all who saw it.    ‚ÄúHello Gotham‚Äù the figure purred her voice a melodic contralto. ‚ÄúDid you miss me? Oh wait you didn‚Äôt even know I existed did you? Allow me to introduce myself. You can call me‚Ä¶ Ms. Racey Rhymes.‚Äù    She giggled the sound eerily reminiscent of the Joker‚Äôs infamous laugh yet distinctly her own. ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôve enjoyed my little exhibitions so far. Consider them my audition for the role of Gotham‚Äôs new maestro of mayhem. The Joker? Oh he‚Äôs so last season. It‚Äôs time for a new act don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù    Her eyes seemed to lock onto the camera and by extension onto Batman himself. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre watching Dark Knight. Are you intrigued? Puzzled? Oh I do hope so. Because this is just the overture my dear. The real performance is yet to come.‚Äù    She leaned in close her masked face filling the screen. ‚ÄúCan you hear it Batman? The rhythm of chaos the melody of madness? It‚Äôs coming for Gotham and not even you can stop it. So put on your dancing shoes darling. Because when the music starts we‚Äôre all going to dance.‚Äù    The screen went dark leaving the museum in eerie silence.    Batman stood his mind racing. This was unlike anything he had faced before. A new player had entered the game one who combined the Joker‚Äôs flair for the theatrical with a poetic sensibility that was both beautiful and terrifying.    ‚ÄúCommissioner‚Äù he said his voice low and intense ‚ÄúI need everything you have on this woman. Bank records security footage witness statements ‚Äì anything that might give us a clue to her identity or her next move.‚Äù    Gordon nodded already pulling out his phone to make the necessary calls. ‚ÄúWhat are you thinking Batman? Who is she?‚Äù    Batman‚Äôs gaze swept the room taking in the altered artworks the grotesque tableau of bodies the lone survivor with her terrifying message. ‚ÄúSomeone who‚Äôs been watching Gotham for a long time‚Äù he said grimly. ‚ÄúSomeone with resources intelligence and a deep-seated grudge. This isn‚Äôt just about chaos or money. This is personal.‚Äù    As he turned to leave Batman‚Äôs eyes fell on a small card that had fluttered to the ground. He picked it up turning it over in his gloved hand. It was a business card for Maxwell Pride one of Gotham‚Äôs most prominent ‚Äì and controversial ‚Äì business moguls.    ‚ÄúGet me everything you can on Maxwell Pride‚Äù Batman said tucking the card away. ‚ÄúI have a feeling he‚Äôs connected to this somehow.‚Äù    As he stepped out into the night Batman couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that Gotham was standing on the precipice of something truly terrifying. Ms. Racey Rhymes was out there plotting her next move and he had a sinking feeling that this was only the beginning of her twisted poem.    The game was afoot and the stakes had never been higher. As he grappled to the rooftops Batman‚Äôs determination solidified into iron resolve. He would solve this riddle unravel this rhyme and bring Ms. Racey Rhymes to justice ‚Äì before Gotham descended into a chaos from which it might never recover.    *****    The warehouse was a study in contrasts. Outside it blended seamlessly into Gotham‚Äôs industrial district a nondescript building among many. Inside however it was a riot of color and chaos that would have made the Joker himself green with envy.    At the center of this maelstrom sat Ms. Racey Rhymes her feet propped up on an antique desk that looked wildly out of place in the warehouse setting. Her toes painted a vivid purple wiggled slightly as she regarded the man standing before her. To her left and right a pair of muscular goons stood at attention their faces painted with grotesque smiles that didn‚Äôt quite reach their eyes.    Ms. Rhymes herself was a vision of calculated madness. Her hair dyed in alternating streaks of green and purple cascaded over her shoulders. She wore a tailored suit that seemed to shift between deep purple and midnight blue depending on how the light hit it. But it was her face that commanded attention ‚Äì pale as moonlight with lips painted a vivid red and eyes that sparkled with equal parts intelligence and insanity.    ‚ÄúSo‚Äù she purred her voice a melody that danced on the edge of reason ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the infamous Revan. I must say you cut quite the imposing figure.‚Äù    The man before her stood silent his face hidden behind a mask that was featureless save for a pair of narrow eye slits. He wore a long dark trench coat that seemed to absorb the light around it. In his hand he held a baseball bat its surface marred by scratches and what looked suspiciously like bloodstains.    Ms. Rhymes leaned forward her eyes glittering. ‚ÄúNot much for conversation are you? That‚Äôs quite alright. I prefer my hired help to be more‚Ä¶ action-oriented.‚Äù    She snapped her fingers and one of her goons stepped forward placing a thick envelope on the desk. ‚ÄúYour advance‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúHalf now half upon completion. Assuming of course that you‚Äôre up to the task.‚Äù    Revan remained motionless for a moment then reached out and took the envelope. His voice when he finally spoke was a low growl that seemed to emanate from the depths of his mask. ‚ÄúThe task?‚Äù    Ms. Rhymes‚Äô smile widened becoming something feral and dangerous. ‚ÄúWhy bringing me the Batman of course. Alive mind you. I have‚Ä¶ plans for our dear Dark Knight.‚Äù    She stood moving around the desk with a grace that belied the madness in her eyes. ‚ÄúYou see Revan I‚Äôm writing an epic. A poem that will shake Gotham to its very foundations. And Batman? He‚Äôs to be my unwitting co-author.‚Äù    Revan‚Äôs grip tightened on his bat. ‚ÄúBatman has bested many. What makes you think I can succeed where others have failed?‚Äù    Ms. Rhymes laughed the sound echoing off the warehouse walls like broken glass. ‚ÄúOh my dear Revan. That‚Äôs precisely why I chose you. You‚Äôre not like the others are you? No you‚Äôre something‚Ä¶ special.‚Äù    She circled him her bare feet silent on the concrete floor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard the whispers you know. They say you‚Äôre more than just a man. That you‚Äôre something‚Ä¶ darker. A force of nature barely contained in human form.‚Äù    Revan remained still but there was a tension in his posture that suggested coiled power ready to be unleashed. ‚ÄúAnd if the whispers are true?‚Äù    ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre exactly what I need‚Äù Ms. Rhymes said clapping her hands together in delight. ‚ÄúYou see Batman thinks he understands chaos. He believes he‚Äôs seen the depths of madness in his rogues‚Äô gallery. But you and I? We‚Äôre going to show him what true chaos looks like.‚Äù    She returned to her desk pulling out a folder and tossing it to Revan. ‚ÄúEverything we know about the Bat. His patterns his weaknesses the places he frequents. Use it ignore it it matters not to me. All that matters is the result.‚Äù    Revan flipped through the folder his masked face revealing nothing. ‚ÄúAnd when I bring him to you?‚Äù    Ms. Rhymes‚Äô smile was all teeth. ‚ÄúThen my dear Revan the real fun begins. You see I have a little‚Ä¶ gift for our caped crusader. A concoction of my own design that‚Äôs going to open his eyes to a whole new world of possibility.‚Äù    She leaned in close her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ‚ÄúImagine it. Batman the stoic defender of Gotham reduced to a laughing giggling mess. And then just when he thinks he‚Äôs lost everything we‚Äôll rebuild him. In our image.‚Äù    Revan closed the folder. ‚ÄúYou seek to break Batman.‚Äù    ‚ÄúBreak him?‚Äù Ms. Rhymes laughed. ‚ÄúOh no my dear. I seek to remake him. To show Gotham that even its greatest hero can fall. And in doing so to prove that chaos is the only true constant in this mad mad world.‚Äù    She extended her hand. ‚ÄúSo do we have a deal?‚Äù    Revan regarded her for a long moment then grasped her hand in his gloved one. ‚ÄúWe have a deal.‚Äù    As Revan turned to leave Ms. Rhymes called out ‚ÄúOh and Revan? Do try to have fun with it. After all what‚Äôs the point of chaos if you can‚Äôt enjoy the show?‚Äù    The door closed behind Revan leaving Ms. Rhymes alone with her goons. She turned to them her smile never wavering. ‚ÄúBoys I think it‚Äôs time we prepared for our guest. After all we want Batman to feel right at home when he arrives.‚Äù    * * *     Across town in a penthouse apartment that screamed of old money and refined taste two women stood before a wall covered in newspaper clippings photographs and handwritten notes. Hannah Pride her blonde hair pulled back in a severe bun traced a line between two photos with a manicured finger.    ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a pattern here Sarah‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt random attacks. She‚Äôs building to something.‚Äù    Sarah Lawson her dark skin a stark contrast to Hannah‚Äôs paleness leaned in close her breath warm on Hannah‚Äôs neck. ‚ÄúYour father‚Äôs company. It‚Äôs at the center of all this.‚Äù    Hannah turned her blue eyes meeting Sarah‚Äôs brown ones. ‚ÄúI know. And that‚Äôs what worries me. If she‚Äôs targeting Pride Enterprises‚Ä¶‚Äù    ‚ÄúThen your father is in danger‚Äù Sarah finished. She placed a comforting hand on Hannah‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll stop her Han. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here.‚Äù    Hannah‚Äôs lips quirked in a small smile. ‚ÄúRemind me again why we‚Äôre doing this ourselves instead of letting the police handle it?‚Äù    Sarah‚Äôs expression darkened. ‚ÄúBecause the police in this city are either corrupt or incompetent. And because‚Ä¶‚Äù She hesitated.    ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs personal‚Äù Hannah said softly. She reached up cupping Sarah‚Äôs face in her hand. ‚ÄúI know love. I haven‚Äôt forgotten what she did to your sister.‚Äù    Sarah leaned into the touch her eyes closing briefly. ‚ÄúSometimes I think you‚Äôre the only thing keeping me sane through all this.‚Äù    Hannah leaned in pressing a gentle kiss to Sarah‚Äôs lips. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll just have to stick around won‚Äôt I?‚Äù    Their moment was interrupted by the sound of Hannah‚Äôs phone ringing. She pulled away reluctantly fishing the device out of her pocket. Her eyes widened as she saw the caller ID.    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my father‚Äù she said a note of surprise in her voice. She answered the call putting it on speaker. ‚ÄúDad? Is everything alright?‚Äù    Maxwell Pride‚Äôs voice crackled through the speaker tense and strained. ‚ÄúHannah where are you? Are you safe?‚Äù    Hannah and Sarah exchanged worried glances. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at the apartment Dad. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù    ‚ÄúListen to me very carefully‚Äù Maxwell said his words coming in a rush. ‚ÄúYou need to leave Gotham. Now. Take Sarah and go somewhere safe. Don‚Äôt tell anyone where you‚Äôre going not even me.‚Äù    ‚ÄúDad you‚Äôre scaring me‚Äù Hannah said her voice rising. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù    There was a pause filled only with the sound of Maxwell‚Äôs heavy breathing. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs coming for me Hannah. Ms. Racey Rhymes. I‚Ä¶ I think I know who she is. And if I‚Äôm right then none of us are safe.‚Äù    Sarah leaned in close to the phone. ‚ÄúMr. Pride we can help. Hannah and I we‚Äôve been investigating‚Äî‚Äù    ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Maxwell‚Äôs shout was sharp enough to make both women flinch. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get involved in this. It‚Äôs too dangerous. Please just‚Ä¶ just go. I‚Äôll contact you when it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù    The line went dead leaving Hannah and Sarah staring at each other in stunned silence.    ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not leaving‚Äù Sarah said after a moment her jaw set in determination.    Hannah nodded already moving towards their equipment. ‚ÄúNo we‚Äôre not. But we are going to find out what the hell is going on.‚Äù    As they prepared to head out into the Gotham night neither woman noticed the small drone hovering outside their window its camera lens glinting in the moonlight.    * * *     In the Batcave Bruce Wayne stood before his computer array cowl pushed back as he pored over the information displayed on the screens. Alfred approached a tray of coffee in his hands.    ‚ÄúAny progress Master Bruce?‚Äù the butler asked setting the tray down.    Bruce ran a hand through his hair frustration evident in every line of his body. ‚ÄúSome but not enough. I‚Äôve managed to trace the chemical components of Ms. Rhymes‚Äô new toxin to a few possible sources but nothing concrete yet.‚Äù    He pulled up an image on the main screen ‚Äì a molecular diagram of the toxin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs brilliant in a terrifying way. She‚Äôs somehow managed to combine elements of Joker venom with a cocktail of other psychoactive compounds. The result is a toxin that doesn‚Äôt just force its victims to laugh ‚Äì it rewires their entire neural pathways.‚Äù    Alfred leaned in his brow furrowed. ‚ÄúGood heavens. You mean to say this toxin actually changes the way the brain functions?‚Äù    Bruce nodded grimly. ‚ÄúExactly. It‚Äôs not just about inducing euphoria or causing muscle spasms. This toxin fundamentally alters the victim‚Äôs perception of reality. In essence it forces them to see the world through the lens of Ms. Rhymes‚Äô particular brand of madness.‚Äù    ‚ÄúA frightening prospect indeed‚Äù Alfred murmured. ‚ÄúAnd what of the connection to Maxwell Pride?‚Äù    Bruce pulled up another screen this one showing a complex web of financial transactions. ‚ÄúPride Enterprises has its fingers in a lot of pies Alfred. Pharmaceuticals chemical research even some experimental psychology studies. Any one of these could be the link we‚Äôre looking for.‚Äù    He zoomed in on one particular node in the web. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something else. About five years ago Pride Enterprises funded a series of poetry workshops for ‚Äòat-risk youth‚Äô. It was a pet project of Maxwell‚Äôs wife Elizabeth.‚Äù    Alfred raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou suspect our Ms. Rhymes might have been a participant in these workshops?‚Äù    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a possibility‚Äù Bruce said. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs more. Three years ago Elizabeth Pride died under mysterious circumstances. The official report says it was an accident but‚Ä¶‚Äù    ‚ÄúBut you suspect foul play‚Äù Alfred finished.    Bruce nodded. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt shake the feeling that Elizabeth‚Äôs death is somehow connected to all this. The timing the way Ms. Rhymes seems to have a personal vendetta against Pride Enterprises ‚Äì it all fits.‚Äù    The computer beeped signaling an incoming transmission. Bruce quickly pulled his cowl back on as Commissioner Gordon‚Äôs face appeared on the screen.    ‚ÄúBatman we‚Äôve got a situation‚Äù Gordon said without preamble. ‚ÄúMaxwell Pride just reached out to us. Says he‚Äôs got information on our mysterious Ms. Rhymes. He‚Äôs requesting protection.‚Äù    Batman‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúWhere is he now?‚Äù    ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing‚Äù Gordon said his voice tight with concern. ‚ÄúHe was supposed to meet us at GCPD headquarters twenty minutes ago. He never showed.‚Äù    Batman was already moving towards the Batmobile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on it Commissioner. Send me everything you have on Pride‚Äôs last known whereabouts.‚Äù    As the vehicle roared to life Bruce couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that they were rapidly approaching a tipping point. Ms. Racey Rhymes had made her opening moves and now the game was escalating. And somewhere out there Maxwell Pride held pieces of the puzzle that could blow this whole case wide open.    The Batmobile tore out of the cave and into the Gotham night. The hunt was on and Batman knew that every second counted. Because in this deadly game of poetry and madness the next rhyme could very well be Gotham‚Äôs last.    ****    The Gotham night was thick with tension as Batman raced through the streets his mind working overtime to piece together the puzzle of Ms. Racey Rhymes and her connection to Maxwell Pride. The Batmobile‚Äôs engine roared a counterpoint to the eerie silence that had fallen over the city.    Suddenly a dark figure stepped out into the street directly in the Batmobile‚Äôs path. Batman slammed on the brakes the vehicle screeching to a halt mere inches from the imposing silhouette.    As Batman emerged from the Batmobile he found himself face to face with Revan. The masked hitman stood motionless his baseball bat held loosely at his side.    ‚ÄúSo‚Äù Batman growled ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the new player in town.‚Äù    Revan‚Äôs voice was a low rumble. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre the one they call the Dark Knight. I‚Äôve been waiting for you.‚Äù    Without warning Revan lunged forward his bat whistling through the air. Batman barely had time to dodge the weapon grazing his cowl as he rolled to the side.    ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for this‚Äù Batman snarled rising to his feet. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Maxwell Pride?‚Äù    Revan chuckled a sound devoid of humor. ‚ÄúAlways so focused on the mission aren‚Äôt you? But tell me Batman when was the last time you faced a true challenge?‚Äù    The two circled each other tension crackling in the air between them. Batman‚Äôs eyes narrowed behind his cowl. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre working for Ms. Rhymes. Why?‚Äù    ‚ÄúWhy does anyone do anything in this city?‚Äù Revan replied twirling his bat with deadly grace. ‚ÄúFor the thrill of the game.‚Äù    With that he attacked again his movements a blur of speed and precision. Batman found himself on the defensive blocking and parrying blows that came with frightening force. It quickly became clear that Revan was no ordinary thug ‚Äì his fighting style was a mix of various martial arts executed with a samurai-like discipline.    As they fought the battle moved through the streets of Gotham each combatant using the urban landscape to their advantage. Batman grappled to a nearby rooftop hoping to gain the high ground but Revan was right behind him scaling the building with inhuman agility.    ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt run from chaos Batman‚Äù Revan called out his voice carrying over the sound of their combat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs coming for Gotham whether you‚Äôre ready or not.‚Äù    Batman gritted his teeth launching a flurry of batarangs that Revan deflected with ease. ‚ÄúChaos is just another word for fear‚Äù he retorted. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt scare easily.‚Äù    Their battle continued across the Gotham skyline a deadly dance of shadows and skill. For every move Batman made Revan seemed to have a counter. It was like fighting a dark mirror of himself and for the first time in a long while Batman felt a flicker of doubt.    Meanwhile across town the Gotham City Police Department headquarters was a hive of activity. Commissioner Gordon stood in the center of the chaos barking orders and trying to coordinate the search for Maxwell Pride.    ‚ÄúI want every available unit out there!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúPride is our key to unraveling this whole mess and I‚Äôll be damned if we lose him now!‚Äù    Suddenly the lights in the station flickered and died plunging the building into darkness. A moment later emergency generators kicked in bathing everything in an eerie red glow.    ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Gordon muttered reaching for his gun.    The answer came in the form of a melodic laugh that seemed to emanate from everywhere at once. ‚ÄúOh Commissioner‚Äù Ms. Racey Rhymes‚Äô voice purred over the station‚Äôs PA system. ‚ÄúDid you really think your little fortress could keep me out?‚Äù    Before anyone could react the windows exploded inward showering the room with glass. Smoke grenades rolled across the floor filling the air with thick purplish smoke. As officers coughed and stumbled shadowy figures moved through the haze ‚Äì Ms. Rhymes‚Äô goons their painted smiles visible even through the smoke.    ‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen of Gotham‚Äôs finest‚Äù Ms. Rhymes‚Äô voice rang out again tinged with manic glee. ‚ÄúWelcome to the next act of our little drama. I do hope you‚Äôre ready for a show-stopping performance!‚Äù    Outside the police station Hannah and Sarah arrived just in time to see the chaos unfolding. They exchanged a determined look before pulling on their own masks ‚Äì simple domino masks that concealed their identities without hampering their vision.    ‚ÄúReady?‚Äù Hannah asked her voice tight with tension.    Sarah nodded pulling out a pair of escrima sticks. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs show these clowns what real justice looks like.‚Äù    Back across town Batman and Revan‚Äôs battle had reached a fever pitch. Both combatants were showing signs of fatigue but neither was willing to give an inch. They stood on opposite ends of a rooftop each assessing the other with newfound respect.    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good‚Äù Batman admitted his breath coming in ragged gasps. ‚ÄúBut this ends now. I won‚Äôt let Gotham fall to madness.‚Äù    Revan tilted his head his mask betraying no emotion. ‚ÄúWho said anything about letting Gotham fall? This isn‚Äôt about destruction Batman. It‚Äôs about transformation.‚Äù    Before Batman could respond a new voice cut through the night. ‚ÄúWell done Revan darling. You‚Äôve played your part beautifully.‚Äù    Both men turned to see Ms. Racey Rhymes standing on a nearby rooftop flanked by her grinning goons. She held a sleek high-tech rifle in her hands aimed squarely at Batman.    ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù Revan demanded a note of anger creeping into his voice.    Ms. Rhymes laughed the sound sending chills down Batman‚Äôs spine. ‚ÄúOh my dear Revan. Did you really think I‚Äôd entrust the capture of the Bat to anyone but myself? You were the distraction darling. The opening act to my grand finale.‚Äù    With that she fired. Batman still reeling from his battle with Revan couldn‚Äôt dodge in time. The dart struck him in the shoulder and almost immediately he felt his limbs growing heavy.    ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Revan shouted moving to intercept but it was too late. Batman stumbled fighting against the potent tranquilizer coursing through his system.    As darkness closed in around him the last thing Batman saw was Ms. Rhymes‚Äô triumphant smile and Revan‚Äôs clenched fists.    At the police station the battle was in full swing. Hannah and Sarah had managed to fight their way inside their skills a match for Ms. Rhymes‚Äô thugs. They moved in perfect sync covering each other‚Äôs blind spots and taking down goon after goon.    ‚ÄúWe need to find Gordon!‚Äù Sarah shouted over the chaos.    Hannah nodded ducking under a wild swing from one of the attackers. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be in the thick of it. Come on!‚Äù    They fought their way deeper into the station the air thick with smoke and the sound of combat. Finally they spotted Commissioner Gordon back-to-back with a handful of officers holding off a group of Ms. Rhymes‚Äô more heavily armed thugs.    ‚ÄúCommissioner!‚Äù Hannah called out. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to help!‚Äù    Gordon‚Äôs eyes widened as he saw the masked women cutting through the chaos. ‚ÄúWho the hell are you?‚Äù    ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù Sarah replied simply her escrima sticks a blur as she took down two attackers in quick succession.    With Hannah and Sarah‚Äôs help the tide began to turn. Ms. Rhymes‚Äô goons facing unexpected resistance began to fall back.    Suddenly Ms. Rhymes‚Äô voice crackled over the PA system once more. ‚ÄúWell well well. It seems our little party has some uninvited guests. How delightfully chaotic! But I‚Äôm afraid I must cut this performance short. I have a very important date with a certain Bat you see.‚Äù    The remaining thugs began a coordinated retreat covering their exit with more smoke grenades. As the air cleared Gordon Hannah and Sarah found themselves standing in the wreckage of the police station.    ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre getting away!‚Äù Sarah growled moving towards the exit.    But Hannah grabbed her arm holding her back. ‚ÄúWait. Listen.‚Äù    In the distance they could hear the wail of approaching sirens. ‚ÄúBackup‚Äù Gordon said a note of relief in his voice. ‚ÄúAbout damn time.‚Äù    Hannah turned to the Commissioner. ‚ÄúWe need to go after Ms. Rhymes. She said something about Batman ‚Äì I think he might be in trouble.‚Äù    Gordon hesitated for a moment then nodded. ‚ÄúGo. I‚Äôll coordinate things here and join you as soon as I can. But be careful ‚Äì this woman is more dangerous than anyone we‚Äôve faced before.‚Äù    As Hannah and Sarah raced out into the night following the trail of Ms. Rhymes‚Äô retreat a new player entered the scene. Revan his posture radiating barely contained fury landed on a nearby rooftop.    ‚ÄúYou‚Äù he growled spotting Hannah and Sarah. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre after Rhymes.‚Äù    The two women tensed ready for another fight but Revan held up a hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to stop you. Rhymes‚Ä¶ she betrayed the code. Used me as a pawn in her game.

He found himself strapped to a chair his utility belt gone surrounded by an array of strange machinery. And there perched on a ornate throne-like chair sat Ms. Racey Rhymes her eyes gleaming with manic glee.    ‚ÄúWelcome back to the land of the living my dear Dark Knight‚Äù she purred. ‚ÄúOh the poem we‚Äôre going to write together‚Ä¶ it will be a masterpiece that will reshape Gotham forever.‚Äù    As Batman struggled against his bonds he realized with growing dread that this was only the beginning of Ms. Racey Rhymes‚Äô twisted performance.

However long he‚Äôd slept - be it six hours or 50 minutes - he‚Äôd be awake at dawn.  Duke - Moves a lot in his sleep. He fell from the bed so many times Alfred had to add extra cushions on the floor. It takes one tap on the shoulder to wake him up.  Tim - Takes power naps throughout the day. Secretly needs to get tucked in and kissed on the forehead to really fall asleep but he‚Äôd rather die than admit it.  Steph - Has a whole nighttime routine before falling asleep. Use of water necessary to wake her up.  Dick - Always wakes up in a contorted position. You‚Äôd think he moved a lot during his sleep but nah he fell asleep like that. Looks flawless when waking up it‚Äôs blinding.  Jason - Counts Joker‚Äôs decapitated heads jumping up fences to help him sleep. When he‚Äôs deep asleep it‚Äôd take a bomb going off right next to his ear to wake him up.  Bruce - To really fall asleep he needs his satin pajamas otherwise be sure that his eyes are just closed.

I feel like with the lack of a reality show most of America and maybe beyond would know Brucie Wayne and that he has a lot of kids. Maybe some people would call them the Gotham Version of the Kardashians but maybe most people wouldn‚Äôt know a lot about the kids (names faces how many of them there are etc.) because other than maybe Dick and Tim I don‚Äôt see any of them doing something that anyone outside of Gotham would care to report on (they don‚Äôt leave Gotham publicly often and people outside Gotham don‚Äôt want to think about what goes on in that hellhole).  Inside of Gotham however is an entirely different story. Inside Gotham everyone can name the Waynes and point them out on sight even Steph gets recognized sometimes though less than the officially adopted kids. Inside Gotham there‚Äôs an article for literally everything they do even if some of them try so incredibly hard to be private people (and they kinda succeed but Gotham thinks they don‚Äôt). Every paper in Gotham has some mention of them even if it‚Äôs just a name drop because they are just so involved in the city and there are just so many of them. Most people have seen a Wayne in person if not personally interacted with them. Unlike other cities with their rich people Gotham loves them. They defend their rich people and they Gatekeep the hell out of them.  Thank you for coming to my dc talk,2024-07-13 01:10:27 GMT

Like the al Ghuls are actually ghouls just to the left of human. (I headcanon the Adams family as ghouls so if you see Adams family themes its because they‚Äôre who I base my idea of ghouls on) Also I head canon that ghouls can‚Äôt physically hurt or be hurt by the people they love that‚Äôs why they feel so comfortable with things like throwing knives at loved ones and adding poison to one another‚Äôs food. It can even be seen as an act of love and affection.  Ras and Talia have a good relationship in their own way but from an outside perspective it looks like they‚Äôre actively trying to kill each other. Bruce knows that they ‚Äòfight‚Äô constantly throwing knives at each other in greeting and when they‚Äôre back is turned sneaking poison into each other‚Äôs food calling each other monstrous names. He just assumes that Ras and Talia are testing each other‚Äôs vigilance in a thinly veiled attempt to kill each other. They are assassins after all.  Any time it Bruce questions why she does the things she does she answers something along the lines: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a ghoul this is what we do.‚Äù but what Bruce hears is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm al Ghul this is what we do.‚Äù and it reinforces his assumptions that this is a raised-as-an-assassins thing.  ‚Äî‚Äì  Talia: *info-dumping about where major arteries are located and sharing her &#x27;studies‚Äô of all the ways she can paralyze someone*  Bruce to himself: Either she‚Äôs threatening me or this is the only way she know how to make conversation because of the way she was raised‚Ä¶Hmm.  He is seduced either way.  ‚Äî‚Äì  Eventually Bruce leaves to Gotham and becomes Batman and Talia doesn‚Äôt tell him about Damian.  Bruce was never really able to understand her ghoulish needs always insisting that she could leave the League and ‚Äúdo better.‚Äù That‚Äôs how their relationship inevitably came to an end with him trying to humanize her (ugh). She knew that Bruce wouldn‚Äôt change just because she was pregnant and she knew her son would have ghoulish needs that couldn‚Äôt be compromised just because Bruce was uncomfortable.  So she decided to keep Damian to her herself until he‚Äôs old enough to know what it means to be a ghoul and shows that he wants to meet his father.,2024-07-13 02:13:50 GMT

Like the al Ghuls are actually ghouls just to the left of human. (I headcanon the Adams family as ghouls so if you see Adams family themes its because they‚Äôre who I base my idea of ghouls on) Also I head canon that ghouls can‚Äôt physically hurt or be hurt by the people they love that‚Äôs why they feel so comfortable with things like throwing knives at loved ones and adding poison to one another‚Äôs food. It can even be seen as an act of love and affection.  Ras and Talia have a good relationship in their own way but from an outside perspective it looks like they‚Äôre actively trying to kill each other. Bruce knows that they ‚Äòfight‚Äô constantly throwing knives at each other in greeting and when they‚Äôre back is turned sneaking poison into each other‚Äôs food calling each other monstrous names. He just assumes that Ras and Talia are testing each other‚Äôs vigilance in a thinly veiled attempt to kill each other. They are assassins after all.  Any time it Bruce questions why she does the things she does she answers something along the lines: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a ghoul this is what we do.‚Äù but what Bruce hears is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm al Ghul this is what we do.‚Äù and it reinforces his assumptions that this is a raised-as-an-assassins thing.  ‚Äî‚Äì  Talia: *info-dumping about where major arteries are located and sharing her &#x27;studies‚Äô of all the ways she can paralyze someone*  Bruce to himself: Either she‚Äôs threatening me or this is the only way she know how to make conversation because of the way she was raised‚Ä¶Hmm.  He is seduced either way.  ‚Äî‚Äì  Eventually Bruce leaves to Gotham and becomes Batman and Talia doesn‚Äôt tell him about Damian.  Bruce was never really able to understand her ghoulish needs always insisting that she could leave the League and ‚Äúdo better.‚Äù That‚Äôs how their relationship inevitably came to an end with him trying to humanize her (ugh). She knew that Bruce wouldn‚Äôt change just because she was pregnant and she knew her son would have ghoulish needs that couldn‚Äôt be compromised just because Bruce was uncomfortable.  So she decided to keep Damian to her herself until he‚Äôs old enough to know what it means to be a ghoul and shows that he wants to meet his father.,2024-07-13 02:13:50 GMT

He tells Talia that Bruce isn‚Äôt the person they thought he was and if either of them are going to be saved they have to do it for themselves. He takes off for the West Coast.   I‚Äôm gonna be selfish and say he settles in Portland with the intent of going back to school. This is the Batman-ified version of Portland though or maybe just the Portland envisioned in conservative media: lawless violent on fire all the time. (Reality check: lol.) The guy can‚Äôt help himself and pretty soon he‚Äôs beating the shit out of Proud Boys downtown. No reason he can‚Äôt smash some fash AND get his GED.   Flash forward a few years and by day he‚Äôs attending Reed College with its rolling lawns nature trails and liberal arts; by night he‚Äôs gotten involved with the local mutual aid network. He‚Äôs got a ponytail and an undercut one full sleeve tattoo and the start of another multiple facial piercings and a Subaru. He‚Äôs joined a polycule ‚Äî nothing serious just some people who are kind with their bodies and have taught him to be the same. He buys secondhand and recycles. He works in the community garden. And if a few Proud Boys have gone missing then no one misses them right? Portland is small enough to be overlooked but big enough to disappear into. He‚Äôs in his lane moisturized thriving.  Then Talia shows up with Damian in tow. Because it makes absolutely no sense for her to send Damian to Bruce in the first place unless she somehow didn‚Äôt know that Bruce slit Jason‚Äôs throat OR she somehow didn‚Äôt give a shit. Why on Earth would she trust Bruce to care for Damian after he‚Äôs already killed one son? No. She gives Damian to Jason.  Has anyone written a fic like this very specific one?

ESPECIALLY not batcow!‚Äù  tim was supposed to pack last night. and he was going to honest! but then the drug case he‚Äôd been tracking picked up some heat again and the time got away from him. so he ropes cass into helping him pack efficiently. she only agrees if he lets her have the window seat.  i feel like out of all of them jason is not a flying kind of guy? like a part of me is really getting the vibe that jason hates to fly so he‚Äôs always gotta have some dramamine on him. that and some noise-canceling headphones.  window seat fans: dick tim cass steph aisle seaters: bruce jason duke damian middle seaters (not by choice): tim and on occasion bruce tim has never ONCE gotten a window seat when they fly steph‚Äôs carryon is JAMPACKED with everything you could ever need. first aid secret snacks etc. she‚Äôs surprised it even fit with her.  dick always brings a double headphone adapter so he forces whatever sibling he‚Äôs seated besides (usually tim) to watch his airplane movie of choice: crazy rich asians unrelated but do you think to keep up appearances bruce joined the mile high club? i think so but anyway back to our regularly scheduled program there are more pictures of damian watching a movie on his green-cased tablet with big headphones than he would like there to be. most of these pictures exist on dick‚Äôs phone.  it‚Äôs a struggle to get tim to sleep at home but on flights? he sleeps like a mf‚Äôin baby. especially when it‚Äôs a night flight so the cabin is dark and comfortable with those pretty lights. yeah goodnight tim drake.  steph is not afraid to get up in an annoying kid‚Äôs face if he‚Äôs kicking her seat. she‚Äôll fight.  one thing about duke? he‚Äôs gonna fuck up some in-flight snacks. sometimes he won‚Äôt even eat them on the flight he‚Äôll just buy a few bags of the peanuts and collect them as a snack for vacation. they work well for him if they go on walking tours that last all day  more pictures on dick‚Äôs phone that said subject wish didn‚Äôt exist: photos of jason conked out on bruce‚Äôs shoulder and he is most definitely drooling dick HATES airplane bathrooms. he‚Äôd rather piss himself than relieve himself in one of those.  cass‚Äôs airplane playlist is fire. she even looks cool listening to it.  damian CANNOT be seated behind tim; thats just a recipe for a no-no. he WILL kick the seat and there WILL be blood. no exceptions.  i skipped ahead to the actual flight and not the airport whoopsies let‚Äôs go over that below dick always gets nervous going through bag check - he‚Äôs always FINE but he worries that somehow he‚Äôs got something he shouldn‚Äôt in his bag (this is something i do i KNOW i don‚Äôt have anything i shouldnt but what if 20 kilos of cocaine suddenly just appeared in my suitcase?)  tim has definitely had airport sushi like that snl skit. didn‚Äôt end well.  remember how i said duke was one of those hot people you see at the airport that you never see again? cass is also one of those people. they are just a cool duo and the paparazzi pictures are lowkey an aesthetic bruce does a roll call at least seven times. it‚Äôs necessary since they have left a kid at home before (it was tim. he was salty about it for at least a month and guilt tripped everyone into doing what he pleased because of it) to pass the time before they board steph and jason play cards. their favorites are war and speed.  jason plays wait for me (reprise) in his headphones everytime he walks on one of those horizontal escalator thingys dick and steph like to impersonate the flight attendants when they do that safety walkthrough the kids all race each other down that long hallway before they board  unless he goes with them alfred‚Äôs vacation usually begins when bruce texts him that they‚Äôve landed and are on the way to the hotel (which opens the door for other shenanigans i might do a part 2 after all)  okay i think thats all i have i think other scenarios i‚Äôd like to do are these:  batfam at a hotel batfam going grocery shopping batfam at a wayne gala batfam on vacation there are probably more but who knows. for all i know i‚Äôll never do another one of these again.,2024-07-13 06:16:08 GMT

61,Batman,['jason todd'  'damian wayne'],stele3,Has anybody written the fic of Jason getting his throat cut by Bruce in ‚ÄúUtRH‚Äù then having a moment of true clarity in his second(?) death(?) and deciding ‚Äúfuck this‚Äù?  He tells Talia that Bruce isn‚Äôt the person they thought he was and if either of them are going to be saved they have to do it for themselves. He takes off for the West Coast.   I‚Äôm gonna be selfish and say he settles in Portland with the intent of going back to school. This is the Batman-ified version of Portland though or maybe just the Portland envisioned in conservative media: lawless violent on fire all the time. (Reality check: lol.) The guy can‚Äôt help himself and pretty soon he‚Äôs beating the shit out of Proud Boys downtown. No reason he can‚Äôt smash some fash AND get his GED.   Flash forward a few years and by day he‚Äôs attending Reed College with its rolling lawns nature trails and liberal arts; by night he‚Äôs gotten involved with the local mutual aid network. He‚Äôs got a ponytail and an undercut one full sleeve tattoo and the start of another multiple facial piercings and a Subaru. He‚Äôs joined a polycule ‚Äî nothing serious just some people who are kind with their bodies and have taught him to be the same. He buys secondhand and recycles. He works in the community garden. And if a few Proud Boys have gone missing then no one misses them right? Portland is small enough to be overlooked but big enough to disappear into. He‚Äôs in his lane moisturized thriving.  Then Talia shows up with Damian in tow. Because it makes absolutely no sense for her to send Damian to Bruce in the first place unless she somehow didn‚Äôt know that Bruce slit Jason‚Äôs throat OR she somehow didn‚Äôt give a shit. Why on Earth would she trust Bruce to care for Damian after he‚Äôs already killed one son? No. She gives Damian to Jason.  Has anyone written a fic like this very specific one?

For years I‚Äôve waited for that ideal Bane. My favorite Batman villain favorite Batman character favorite DC character period. Everything before this has been based on designs I hate too damn big or really outdated. Or broken in the case of the last MAFEX Bane I owned based on his appearance in The Dark Knight Rises. Still that‚Äôs movie based. I wanted something that was based on the comics or close enough. Unfortunately most Bane designs outside the comics deviate in ways I can‚Äôt stand like giving him an open mouth/nose mask. I was left without many options.  All that preamble to say: I‚Äôve been waiting for this one. I love Bane a lot and I love this figure a lot. It‚Äôs not perfect. The paint is sloppy in some areas especially the hands. Mine actually came with two right open hands! That stings. Still he comes with so many options that I don‚Äôt find myself missing that so much. Also HLJ had my back there and I‚Äôll be getting a replacement woooo.  Everything else though? Golden. Scale sculpt and articulation are all there. He even came with two face options. Both are good but gimme that angular eyed ANGRY look anytime. Pure Knightfall-based goodness. Osito not included btw I stole that from a FvJ Jason figure.  Now that I have a great Bane I‚Äôm more open to really getting a solid Batman collection going. I‚Äôm not the biggest DC fan so I‚Äôm not out to build a whole universe but I do like Batman. Also for any companies listening I‚Äôd be totally down for some good Teen Titans figures too. Those are my two corners of the DCU.,2024-07-13 07:10:36 GMT

Batman the Dark Knight of Gotham found himself strapped to a chair his utility belt gone surrounded by an array of ominous machinery. Before him stood Ms. Racey Rhymes her eyes gleaming with a manic intensity that sent chills down his spine.     ‚ÄúWelcome to the grand stage my caped muse‚Äù Ms. Rhymes purred her voice a discordant melody. ‚ÄúAre you ready for your starring role?‚Äù     Batman‚Äôs jaw clenched his eyes narrowing behind his cowl. ‚ÄúWhatever you‚Äôre planning Rhymes it won‚Äôt work. Gotham has faced worse than you.‚Äù     A giggle escaped Ms. Rhymes‚Äô painted lips. ‚ÄúOh my dear Dark Knight you misunderstand. I‚Äôm not here to face Gotham. I‚Äôm here to remake it. And you my brooding bat will be my masterpiece.‚Äù     She snapped her fingers and a figure emerged from the shadows. Tall and lithe with features that seemed to shift between masculine and feminine the newcomer exuded an aura of calculated menace.     ‚ÄúAllow me to introduce my collaborator‚Äù Ms. Rhymes said her voice dripping with false sweetness. ‚ÄúThe Chimera. A true artist of the mind.‚Äù     The Chimera stepped forward their face hidden behind a mask that seemed to morph and change with each passing moment. When they spoke their voice was a disorienting blend of tones and pitches.     ‚ÄúHello Batman. I‚Äôve been looking forward to our session.‚Äù     Batman‚Äôs mind raced trying to place this new threat. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of Crane‚Äôs students‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúI remember the files. You disappeared years ago.‚Äù     The Chimera tilted their head the gesture unnervingly birdlike. ‚ÄúVery good Detective. But Dr. Crane was merely the beginning of my journey. Now I‚Äôm something‚Ä¶ more.‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes clapped her hands together in delight. ‚ÄúEnough chitchat! Let the performance begin!‚Äù     The Chimera moved to a control panel their fingers dancing across the keys. Suddenly a fine mist began to fill the room and Batman felt his senses beginning to blur.     ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what is this?‚Äù he gasped fighting against the rising tide of disorientation.     ‚ÄúConsider it a cocktail of my own design‚Äù The Chimera replied their voice seeming to come from everywhere at once. ‚ÄúFear toxin mixed with a dash of hallucinogens and a sprinkle of my own special additions. We‚Äôre going to peel back those layers of sanity Batman. One by one.‚Äù     As the mist thickened Batman‚Äôs vision began to swim. The room around him warped and twisted melting away into a nightmarish landscape. The last thing he heard before succumbing to the hallucinations was Ms. Rhymes‚Äô singsong voice:     ‚ÄúIn shadows deep and madness vast  Gotham‚Äôs hero breathes his last.  A mind once strong now torn apart  Welcome Batman to your new start.‚Äù     * * *     Across town in an abandoned warehouse that served as their temporary base Hannah Sarah and their unlikely ally Revan ‚Äì now revealed as Samantha Faith ‚Äì pored over maps and documents.     ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve checked every known hideout‚Äù Hannah said frustration evident in her voice. ‚ÄúWhere could Rhymes be keeping him?‚Äù     Sarah placed a comforting hand on her partner‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find him Han. We have to.‚Äù     Samantha her mask off but still cutting an imposing figure studied the map intently. ‚ÄúRhymes is theatrical. She‚Äôll want a stage for her ‚Äòperformance.‚Äô Somewhere significant.‚Äù     ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù Sarah asked her brow furrowed.     ‚ÄúWait‚Äù Hannah said her eyes widening. ‚ÄúWhat about Arkham not the new one? The old asylum‚Äôs been abandoned for years. It‚Äôs perfect ‚Äì isolated symbolic‚Ä¶‚Äù     Samantha nodded slowly. ‚ÄúAnd with a history of madness. It fits Rhymes‚Äô MO.‚Äù     As they began to plan their assault on Arkham Sarah couldn‚Äôt help but voice the question that had been nagging at her. ‚ÄúSamantha‚Ä¶ why are you helping us? You were working for Rhymes.‚Äù     Samantha‚Äôs eyes hardened. ‚ÄúI was hired to do a job. To test Batman to challenge him. Not‚Ä¶ this. There‚Äôs no honor in breaking a warrior‚Äôs mind.‚Äù     Hannah studied the woman before her. ‚ÄúAnd the whole Revan persona? The baseball bat?‚Äù     A small smile tugged at Samantha‚Äôs lips. ‚ÄúEvery warrior needs their weapon. And sometimes the best disguise is one that plays into people‚Äôs expectations.‚Äù     As the trio finalized their plans the air was thick with tension. They all knew that time was running out for Batman ‚Äì and for Gotham.     * * *     In the depths of his toxin-induced nightmare Batman found himself in a twisted version of Gotham. The sky above was a sickly green and the buildings seemed to breathe and pulse with malevolent life.     ‚ÄúWell well well‚Äù a familiar voice cackled. ‚ÄúLook who‚Äôs come to play!‚Äù     Batman spun around to find himself face to face with the Joker his grin wider and more manic than ever.     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real‚Äù Batman growled his fists clenching. ‚ÄúThis is all in my head.‚Äù     The Joker‚Äôs laughter echoed off the writhing buildings. ‚ÄúOh Batsy! Don‚Äôt you know? The stuff in our heads is the realest thing there is! Now come on let‚Äôs have some fun!‚Äù     Suddenly Batman was surrounded by a horde of grinning laughing maniacs all wearing the Joker‚Äôs face. As he fought them off each punch seemed to make two more appear.     ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt win this one Batman‚Äù the Joker taunted. ‚ÄúWhy not join us? Think of the laughs we could have together!‚Äù     Batman gritted his teeth fighting against the rising tide of chaos. ‚ÄúNever‚Äù he snarled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never become like you.‚Äù     But even as he said it a small voice in the back of his mind whispered ‚ÄúAre you so sure?‚Äù     * * *     Back in the real world The Chimera monitored Batman‚Äôs vital signs with clinical detachment. ‚ÄúFascinating‚Äù they murmured. ‚ÄúHis mental resilience is truly remarkable.‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes peered at the screens her eyes glittering with malicious glee. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs cracking isn‚Äôt he? I can almost hear the fissures forming in that rigid psyche of his.‚Äù     The Chimera nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYes but we must be cautious. Push too hard too fast and his mind might shatter completely. We want to remake him not destroy him utterly.‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes waved a dismissive hand. ‚ÄúDetails details. Just keep pushing my dear Chimera. I want to see what lurks in the deepest darkest corners of the Bat‚Äôs mind.‚Äù     As they spoke neither noticed the small drone hovering outside the window its camera capturing every moment of their sinister collaboration.     * * *     Hannah Sarah and Samantha crouched in the shadows outside the old Arkham Asylum their eyes fixed on the crumbling structure before them.     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm picking up heat signatures on the top floor‚Äù Hannah whispered consulting a handheld device. ‚ÄúLooks like that‚Äôs where they‚Äôre keeping him.‚Äù     Sarah nodded her grip tightening on her escrima sticks. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the plan? We can‚Äôt just burst in there. Who knows what they‚Äôve done to Batman‚Äôs mind by now.‚Äù     Samantha‚Äôs eyes narrowed behind her mask. ‚ÄúWe need a distraction. Something to draw their attention while we extract Batman.‚Äù     Hannah‚Äôs lips curled into a grim smile. ‚ÄúI think I have just the thing. But you‚Äôre not going to like it.‚Äù     As she outlined her plan Sarah and Samantha exchanged worried glances. It was risky borderline insane. But then again in a city like Gotham sometimes insanity was the only sane response.     * * *     Deep in the labyrinth of his own mind Batman stumbled through a nightmare version of Crime Alley. The walls seemed to weep blood and every shadow held a pair of gleaming malevolent eyes.     ‚ÄúWhy do you keep fighting Bruce?‚Äù a voice whispered on the wind. Batman turned to see his parents standing before him their forms flickering like old film.     ‚ÄúMom? Dad?‚Äù he croaked his voice breaking.     Thomas Wayne‚Äôs face twisted into a sneer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve failed us son. Failed Gotham. Look around you ‚Äì the city is as dark and corrupt as ever.‚Äù     ‚ÄúNo‚Äù Batman protested shaking his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made a difference. I‚Äôve saved lives.‚Äù     Martha Wayne‚Äôs laugh was cold and cruel. ‚ÄúSaved lives? Oh Bruce. How many have died because of your crusade? How many have suffered because you refuse to do what‚Äôs necessary?‚Äù     As his parents‚Äô accusations rained down upon him Batman felt something inside him begin to crack. A small part of his mind screamed that this wasn‚Äôt real that it was all a toxin-induced nightmare. But the doubt the guilt the fear ‚Äì it all felt so terribly painfully real.     * * *     In the control room The Chimera‚Äôs eyes widened as they studied the readouts. ‚ÄúRemarkable‚Äù they breathed. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs accessing trauma so deeply buried I doubt even he was fully aware of it.‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes leaned in close her breath hot on The Chimera‚Äôs neck. ‚ÄúAnd what do we do with all this delicious trauma my dear?‚Äù     The Chimera‚Äôs fingers danced across the controls. ‚ÄúWe amplify it. We twist it. And then when he‚Äôs at his most vulnerable we offer him a way out. A new identity free from all that pain and guilt.‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes‚Äô grin was positively feral. ‚ÄúA new Clown Prince of Crime. Oh I do love poetry in motion.‚Äù     Suddenly alarms began to blare throughout the asylum. The Chimera‚Äôs head snapped up their eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúWe have intruders.‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes‚Äô face darkened. ‚ÄúDeal with them. I don‚Äôt care how. Just make sure our performance isn‚Äôt interrupted.‚Äù     As The Chimera hurried from the room Ms. Rhymes turned back to the monitors her eyes fixed on Batman‚Äôs twisting form. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just you and me now my dark muse. Let‚Äôs see what other horrors we can conjure up shall we?‚Äù     * * *     Outside Arkham chaos reigned. Hannah‚Äôs ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù had taken the form of a series of explosions around the perimeter of the asylum each one timed to draw attention away from their true goal.     As Rhymes‚Äô goons scrambled to respond to the perceived attack Samantha Sarah and Hannah slipped inside through a service entrance.     ‚ÄúRemember‚Äù Samantha whispered as they made their way through the asylum‚Äôs twisted corridors ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know what state Batman will be in when we find him. Be prepared for anything.‚Äù     Sarah nodded grimly. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just hope we‚Äôre not too late.‚Äù     As they ascended to the upper floors the sounds of conflict echoed through the building. Hannah‚Äôs lips curved into a small smile. ‚ÄúSounds like our diversion is working.‚Äù     Suddenly a figure stepped out of the shadows before them. The Chimera their mask seeming to ripple in the dim light.     ‚ÄúWell‚Äù The Chimera said their voice a disorienting blend of tones ‚Äúit seems we have some uninvited guests. How‚Ä¶ intriguing.‚Äù     Samantha stepped forward her baseball bat held at the ready. ‚ÄúStand aside. We‚Äôre here for Batman.‚Äù     The Chimera tilted their head the gesture unnervingly birdlike. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt allow that. You see we‚Äôre in the middle of a very delicate procedure. Any interruption could be‚Ä¶ catastrophic.‚Äù     Without warning The Chimera lashed out a spray of some unknown substance erupting from their sleeve. Samantha managed to dodge but Hannah and Sarah weren‚Äôt as lucky. As the mist enveloped them their eyes widened in horror.     ‚ÄúRun!‚Äù Samantha shouted charging at The Chimera. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hold them off! Find Batman!‚Äù     As Samantha engaged The Chimera in a fierce battle Hannah and Sarah stumbled away their minds already beginning to cloud with hallucinations.     ‚ÄúWe have to‚Ä¶ have to keep going‚Äù Hannah gasped her vision swimming. ‚ÄúBatman‚Ä¶ we need to‚Ä¶‚Äù     Sarah gripped her partner‚Äôs hand tightly. ‚ÄúTogether‚Äù she said firmly. ‚ÄúWhatever happens we face it together.‚Äù     As they staggered down the corridor the walls seemed to breathe and pulse around them The Chimera‚Äôs toxin taking full effect. But still they pressed on driven by a determination that ran deeper than any fear.     * * *     In the depths of his fractured psyche Batman found himself standing atop Wayne Tower the city spread out before him like a diseased corpse. The sky above was a roiling mass of green and purple punctuated by flashes of sickly lightning.     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite a view isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù a voice said from behind him. Batman turned to see the Joker standing there but this time the clown‚Äôs face was a perfect mirror of his own.     ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what is this?‚Äù Batman growled his voice hoarse.     The Joker-Batman grinned the expression grotesque on the familiar features. ‚ÄúThis is liberation Brucie! This is what happens when you finally let go of all that guilt all that responsibility. When you embrace the joke that is existence!‚Äù     Batman shook his head trying to clear the fog from his mind. ‚ÄúNo. This isn‚Äôt real. I would never‚Ä¶‚Äù     ‚ÄúOh but you would‚Äù the Joker-Batman cackled. ‚ÄúYou will! Think about it ‚Äì how many times have you been one bad day away from becoming just like the monsters you fight? How thin is that line you walk?‚Äù     As the Joker-Batman‚Äôs words washed over him Batman felt something deep inside beginning to give way. The weight of his mission the endless parade of tragedy and horror he‚Äôd witnessed ‚Äì it all came crashing down at once.     And for the first time in as long as he could remember Batman began to laugh.     * * *     In the control room Ms. Rhymes watched the monitors with growing excitement. ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù she crowed. ‚ÄúYes that‚Äôs it! Laugh my dark knight! Embrace the madness!‚Äù     She was so engrossed in the spectacle before her that she didn‚Äôt notice the door opening behind her. Hannah and Sarah their minds still reeling from The Chimera‚Äôs toxin stumbled into the room.     ‚ÄúStop‚Ä¶ stop this‚Äù Hannah gasped her voice barely above a whisper.     Ms. Rhymes spun around her eyes widening in surprise before narrowing in anger. ‚ÄúYou! How did you get past The Chimera?‚Äù     Sarah raised her escrima sticks though her hands shook with the effort. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôre here to stop you.‚Äù     A cruel smile spread across Ms. Rhymes‚Äô face. ‚ÄúOh my dears. You‚Äôre far too late for that. Batman is already falling. Soon he‚Äôll be reborn as Gotham‚Äôs new agent of chaos. And there‚Äôs nothing you can do to stop it.‚Äù     As if to punctuate her words Batman‚Äôs laughter echoed through the room growing louder and more unhinged with each passing moment.     Hannah and Sarah exchanged a desperate look. They were running out of time.     * * *     In the corridor outside Samantha and The Chimera continued their fierce battle. The Chimera‚Äôs fighting style was a disorienting blend of techniques their body seeming to flow like water around Samantha‚Äôs attacks.     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good‚Äù The Chimera said their voice a mix of admiration and malice. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre fighting for the wrong side. Can‚Äôt you see the beauty in what we‚Äôre creating?‚Äù     Samantha‚Äôs eyes narrowed behind her mask. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no beauty in breaking a warrior‚Äôs mind. Only cowardice.‚Äù     The Chimera laughed the sound echoing off the asylum‚Äôs walls. ‚ÄúOh my dear. We‚Äôre not breaking his mind. We‚Äôre setting it free!‚Äù     As they fought the sounds of Batman‚Äôs laughter grew louder more manic. Samantha felt a chill run down her spine. They were running out of time.     * * *     In the twisted landscape of his mind Batman stood on the edge of Wayne Tower teetering between sanity and madness. The Joker-Batman stood beside him arm draped over his shoulders like an old friend.     ‚ÄúCome on Brucie‚Äù the Joker-Batman cajoled. ‚ÄúOne little step. That‚Äôs all it takes. One step and all the pain all the responsibility ‚Äì it all goes away. Isn‚Äôt that what you‚Äôve always wanted?‚Äù     Batman looked out over the nightmare version of Gotham his mind a whirlwind of conflicting thoughts and emotions. Part of him knew this wasn‚Äôt real that it was all a toxin-induced hallucination. But another part a part that had been buried deep for so long whispered that maybe just maybe this was the answer he‚Äôd been looking for all along.     *****     Batman stood on the precipice both literally and figuratively. The Joker-Batman‚Äôs words echoed in his mind a siren song of chaos and release. For a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity he teetered on the edge.     Then with a laugh that started low and grew into a manic cackle Batman stepped off the ledge.     As he fell through the nightmare cityscape his laughter echoed off the twisted buildings. The world around him began to blur and shift colors swirling together in a dizzying kaleidoscope of madness.     * * *     In the control room Ms. Rhymes watched the monitors with growing excitement. ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù she crowed. ‚ÄúYes that‚Äôs it! Fall my dark knight! Fall into the abyss of chaos!‚Äù     Hannah and Sarah still fighting against the effects of The Chimera‚Äôs toxin struggled to make sense of what they were seeing.     ‚ÄúWe have to‚Ä¶ have to stop this‚Äù Hannah gasped her vision swimming.     Sarah reached out gripping her partner‚Äôs hand tightly. ‚ÄúHow? We can barely stand‚Ä¶‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes turned to them her eyes glittering with malicious glee. ‚ÄúOh my dears. You can‚Äôt stop this. You‚Äôre witnessing the birth of a new era for Gotham. The fall of its greatest hero‚Ä¶ and the rise of its most terrifying villain!‚Äù     * * *     Outside in the corridor Samantha and The Chimera‚Äôs battle had reached a fever pitch. Both combatants were showing signs of fatigue but neither was willing to give an inch.     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fighting a losing battle‚Äù The Chimera panted their mask seeming to ripple with each breath. ‚ÄúEven if you defeat me you can‚Äôt undo what‚Äôs been done to Batman‚Äôs mind.‚Äù     Samantha‚Äôs eyes narrowed behind her mask. ‚ÄúMaybe not. But I can make sure you pay for what you‚Äôve done.‚Äù     With a burst of speed Samantha feinted left then brought her baseball bat around in a vicious arc. The Chimera caught off guard couldn‚Äôt dodge in time. The bat connected with their mask with a sickening crunch.     The Chimera stumbled back their mask cracking and falling away in pieces. As it did Samantha‚Äôs eyes widened in shock.     ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre‚Ä¶‚Äù     But before she could finish The Chimera lashed out with a hidden blade forcing Samantha back. Taking advantage of her momentary surprise they turned and fled down the corridor.     Samantha hesitated for a moment torn between pursuit and the need to help Batman. With a growl of frustration she turned towards the control room. Batman had to be the priority.     * * *     In the swirling vortex of his mind Batman continued to fall. As he did he felt his very identity begin to unravel. Memories flashed before his eyes ‚Äì his parents‚Äô murder his years of training his countless battles to protect Gotham. But now each memory was tinged with a manic hilarity as if every tragedy in his life had suddenly become the punchline to some cosmic joke.     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it Brucie!‚Äù the Joker-Batman‚Äôs voice echoed around him. ‚ÄúLet it all go! Embrace the madness!‚Äù     As he fell deeper into the abyss of his own psyche Batman felt something fundamental shifting within him. The rigid moral code that had defined him for so long began to crack and splinter.     And still he laughed.     * * *     In the control room the tension had reached a breaking point. Ms. Rhymes stood before the monitors her arms spread wide as if conducting some twisted symphony. Hannah and Sarah still reeling from The Chimera‚Äôs toxin struggled to formulate a plan.     Suddenly the door burst open and Samantha charged in her baseball bat at the ready.     ‚ÄúStep away from the controls‚Äù she growled.     Ms. Rhymes spun around her eyes widening in surprise before narrowing in anger. ‚ÄúRevan‚Ä¶ or should I say Samantha? I must admit I‚Äôm disappointed. I thought you understood the beauty of what we‚Äôre creating here.‚Äù     Samantha‚Äôs grip tightened on her bat. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no beauty in this. Only madness and pain.‚Äù     As they faced off the room filled with the sound of Batman‚Äôs laughter growing louder and more unhinged with each passing moment.     Hannah fighting through the haze of the toxin stumbled towards the controls. ‚ÄúWe have to‚Ä¶ have to shut it down‚Ä¶‚Äù     But before she could reach them Ms. Rhymes pulled out a small remote. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that if I were you‚Äù she said her voice dripping with malice. ‚ÄúOne push of this button and Batman‚Äôs mind is wiped clean. Everything he was everything he believed in ‚Äì gone in an instant.‚Äù     The room froze the tension palpable. Samantha‚Äôs eyes darted between Ms. Rhymes and the monitors showing Batman‚Äôs writhing form. Sarah supporting a still-woozy Hannah glared at the madwoman before them.     ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù Samantha asked her voice tight.     Ms. Rhymes‚Äô smile was all teeth. ‚ÄúWant? My dear I want what I‚Äôve always wanted. To show Gotham ‚Äì to show the world ‚Äì the true face of chaos. And what better way to do that than to turn its greatest protector into its worst nightmare?‚Äù     As she spoke the monitors behind her flickered. Batman‚Äôs laughter had reached a fever pitch and suddenly it cut off. The silence that followed was deafening.     All eyes turned to the screens. Batman‚Äôs body had gone still his face hidden in shadow.     ‚ÄúNo‚Äù Sarah whispered her eyes wide with horror.     Ms. Rhymes‚Äô grin widened. ‚ÄúYes. Watch closely my dears. You‚Äôre about to witness the rebirth of a legend.‚Äù     * * *     In the depths of his fractured psyche Batman stood in a void. The swirling chaos around him had stilled leaving him in a space of perfect empty blackness.     ‚ÄúSo‚Äù he said his voice echoing in the emptiness ‚Äúthis is madness.‚Äù     The Joker-Batman appeared before him but now instead of a mirror image it was a swirling ever-changing figure ‚Äì sometimes the Joker sometimes Batman sometimes a nightmarish blend of the two.     ‚ÄúNot madness Brucie‚Äù it said its voice a cacophony of laughter and growls. ‚ÄúClarity. You‚Äôve finally seen the joke that is existence. The futility of your crusade. The utter absurdity of it all.‚Äù     Batman looked down at his hands watching as his costume began to shift and change colors bleeding and swirling.     ‚ÄúAnd now?‚Äù he asked his voice utterly calm.     The figure before him grinned the expression stretching beyond the limits of a human face. ‚ÄúNow you become what you were always meant to be. Gotham‚Äôs darkest knight. Its clown prince of crime. Its harbinger of beautiful perfect chaos.‚Äù     As the words washed over him Batman felt the last vestiges of his old self falling away. In its place rose something new. Something terrifying. Something‚Ä¶ free.     He threw back his head and laughed the sound echoing through the void and beyond into the world of the waking.     * * *     In the control room all eyes were fixed on the monitors as Batman‚Äôs body began to stir. Slowly he sat up his movements fluid and unnaturally graceful.     ‚ÄúNo‚Äù Samantha breathed her bat slipping from nerveless fingers. ‚ÄúWhat have you done?‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes‚Äô eyes gleamed with triumph. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve given Gotham its new god of chaos. Behold the birth of a legend!‚Äù     On the screen Batman turned towards the camera. As his face came into view a collective gasp filled the room. His cowl had split and peeled back revealing a face that was a nightmarish blend of Batman and the Joker. His skin was pale almost white with streaks of black that mimicked the design of his cowl. His lips were stretched in a grin that was too wide too full of teeth to be natural.     But it was his eyes that truly chilled the blood. They burned with a manic intensity swirling with colors that shouldn‚Äôt exist in nature.     When he spoke his voice was a blend of Batman‚Äôs gravelly growl and the Joker‚Äôs high-pitched cackle. ‚ÄúGotham‚Äù he said his grin widening impossibly further ‚Äúyour Dark Knight has fallen. But fear not ‚Äì a new protector rises. One who understands that the only way to save this city‚Ä¶ is to embrace the madness.‚Äù     He stood his costume rippling and changing. The blacks and greys bled into purples and greens while still maintaining the silhouette of the Bat. The result was a terrifying fusion of Batman and the Joker a creature of nightmare made flesh.     ‚ÄúThe joke‚Äôs on you Gotham‚Äù he continued spreading his arms wide. ‚ÄúYou thought you needed a hero. But what you really need‚Ä¶ is a little chaos.‚Äù     With that he threw back his head and laughed. It was a sound that contained multitudes ‚Äì the deep restrained chuckle of Bruce Wayne the gravelly growl of Batman the manic cackle of the Joker and something else. Something new and terrifying.     In the control room Ms. Rhymes drank in the sight with undisguised glee. ‚ÄúBeautiful‚Äù she breathed. ‚ÄúAbsolutely beautiful.‚Äù     Samantha Hannah and Sarah watched in horror the full weight of their failure crashing down upon them. They had come to save Batman to stop Ms. Rhymes‚Äô plan. Instead they had witnessed the fall of Gotham‚Äôs greatest hero and the birth of its most terrifying villain.     As the newly reborn Batman-Joker hybrid continued to laugh his voice echoing through the asylum and beyond a chill ran down the spines of all who heard it. For in that laugh was a promise ‚Äì a promise of chaos of madness of a Gotham reshaped in the image of its fallen hero.     The Dark Knight had fallen. And in his place rose something far deadlier ‚Äì a creature of shadow and laughter of justice twisted into madness. Gotham‚Äôs new Clown Prince of Crime had arrived.     And the city would never be the same again.     As the screens went dark plunging the control room into shadows broken only by the eerie glow of emergency lights Ms. Rhymes turned to her stunned audience her eyes gleaming with triumphant madness.     ‚ÄúAnd so‚Äù she said her voice dripping with malicious glee ‚Äúthe curtain falls on this act of our grand performance. But fear not my dears. The show is far from over. In fact‚Ä¶‚Äù Her grin widened becoming something feral and terrifying. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only just beginning.‚Äù     The asylum echoed with the sound of mad laughter ‚Äì Ms. Rhymes‚Äô the newly reborn Batman‚Äôs and perhaps most chillingly of all the laughter of a city teetering on the brink of total chaos.     In the growing darkness as the weight of their failure pressed down upon them Samantha Hannah and Sarah exchanged grim looks. They had lost this battle but the war for Gotham‚Äôs soul was far from over.     The question now was: in a city without its Dark Knight who would rise to face the coming storm?,2024-07-13 12:55:59 GMT

Batman the Dark Knight of Gotham found himself strapped to a chair his utility belt gone surrounded by an array of ominous machinery. Before him stood Ms. Racey Rhymes her eyes gleaming with a manic intensity that sent chills down his spine.     ‚ÄúWelcome to the grand stage my caped muse‚Äù Ms. Rhymes purred her voice a discordant melody. ‚ÄúAre you ready for your starring role?‚Äù     Batman‚Äôs jaw clenched his eyes narrowing behind his cowl. ‚ÄúWhatever you‚Äôre planning Rhymes it won‚Äôt work. Gotham has faced worse than you.‚Äù     A giggle escaped Ms. Rhymes‚Äô painted lips. ‚ÄúOh my dear Dark Knight you misunderstand. I‚Äôm not here to face Gotham. I‚Äôm here to remake it. And you my brooding bat will be my masterpiece.‚Äù     She snapped her fingers and a figure emerged from the shadows. Tall and lithe with features that seemed to shift between masculine and feminine the newcomer exuded an aura of calculated menace.     ‚ÄúAllow me to introduce my collaborator‚Äù Ms. Rhymes said her voice dripping with false sweetness. ‚ÄúThe Chimera. A true artist of the mind.‚Äù     The Chimera stepped forward their face hidden behind a mask that seemed to morph and change with each passing moment. When they spoke their voice was a disorienting blend of tones and pitches.     ‚ÄúHello Batman. I‚Äôve been looking forward to our session.‚Äù     Batman‚Äôs mind raced trying to place this new threat. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of Crane‚Äôs students‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúI remember the files. You disappeared years ago.‚Äù     The Chimera tilted their head the gesture unnervingly birdlike. ‚ÄúVery good Detective. But Dr. Crane was merely the beginning of my journey. Now I‚Äôm something‚Ä¶ more.‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes clapped her hands together in delight. ‚ÄúEnough chitchat! Let the performance begin!‚Äù     The Chimera moved to a control panel their fingers dancing across the keys. Suddenly a fine mist began to fill the room and Batman felt his senses beginning to blur.     ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what is this?‚Äù he gasped fighting against the rising tide of disorientation.     ‚ÄúConsider it a cocktail of my own design‚Äù The Chimera replied their voice seeming to come from everywhere at once. ‚ÄúFear toxin mixed with a dash of hallucinogens and a sprinkle of my own special additions. We‚Äôre going to peel back those layers of sanity Batman. One by one.‚Äù     As the mist thickened Batman‚Äôs vision began to swim. The room around him warped and twisted melting away into a nightmarish landscape. The last thing he heard before succumbing to the hallucinations was Ms. Rhymes‚Äô singsong voice:     ‚ÄúIn shadows deep and madness vast  Gotham‚Äôs hero breathes his last.  A mind once strong now torn apart  Welcome Batman to your new start.‚Äù     * * *     Across town in an abandoned warehouse that served as their temporary base Hannah Sarah and their unlikely ally Revan ‚Äì now revealed as Samantha Faith ‚Äì pored over maps and documents.     ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve checked every known hideout‚Äù Hannah said frustration evident in her voice. ‚ÄúWhere could Rhymes be keeping him?‚Äù     Sarah placed a comforting hand on her partner‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find him Han. We have to.‚Äù     Samantha her mask off but still cutting an imposing figure studied the map intently. ‚ÄúRhymes is theatrical. She‚Äôll want a stage for her ‚Äòperformance.‚Äô Somewhere significant.‚Äù     ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù Sarah asked her brow furrowed.     ‚ÄúWait‚Äù Hannah said her eyes widening. ‚ÄúWhat about Arkham not the new one? The old asylum‚Äôs been abandoned for years. It‚Äôs perfect ‚Äì isolated symbolic‚Ä¶‚Äù     Samantha nodded slowly. ‚ÄúAnd with a history of madness. It fits Rhymes‚Äô MO.‚Äù     As they began to plan their assault on Arkham Sarah couldn‚Äôt help but voice the question that had been nagging at her. ‚ÄúSamantha‚Ä¶ why are you helping us? You were working for Rhymes.‚Äù     Samantha‚Äôs eyes hardened. ‚ÄúI was hired to do a job. To test Batman to challenge him. Not‚Ä¶ this. There‚Äôs no honor in breaking a warrior‚Äôs mind.‚Äù     Hannah studied the woman before her. ‚ÄúAnd the whole Revan persona? The baseball bat?‚Äù     A small smile tugged at Samantha‚Äôs lips. ‚ÄúEvery warrior needs their weapon. And sometimes the best disguise is one that plays into people‚Äôs expectations.‚Äù     As the trio finalized their plans the air was thick with tension. They all knew that time was running out for Batman ‚Äì and for Gotham.     * * *     In the depths of his toxin-induced nightmare Batman found himself in a twisted version of Gotham. The sky above was a sickly green and the buildings seemed to breathe and pulse with malevolent life.     ‚ÄúWell well well‚Äù a familiar voice cackled. ‚ÄúLook who‚Äôs come to play!‚Äù     Batman spun around to find himself face to face with the Joker his grin wider and more manic than ever.     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real‚Äù Batman growled his fists clenching. ‚ÄúThis is all in my head.‚Äù     The Joker‚Äôs laughter echoed off the writhing buildings. ‚ÄúOh Batsy! Don‚Äôt you know? The stuff in our heads is the realest thing there is! Now come on let‚Äôs have some fun!‚Äù     Suddenly Batman was surrounded by a horde of grinning laughing maniacs all wearing the Joker‚Äôs face. As he fought them off each punch seemed to make two more appear.     ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt win this one Batman‚Äù the Joker taunted. ‚ÄúWhy not join us? Think of the laughs we could have together!‚Äù     Batman gritted his teeth fighting against the rising tide of chaos. ‚ÄúNever‚Äù he snarled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never become like you.‚Äù     But even as he said it a small voice in the back of his mind whispered ‚ÄúAre you so sure?‚Äù     * * *     Back in the real world The Chimera monitored Batman‚Äôs vital signs with clinical detachment. ‚ÄúFascinating‚Äù they murmured. ‚ÄúHis mental resilience is truly remarkable.‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes peered at the screens her eyes glittering with malicious glee. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs cracking isn‚Äôt he? I can almost hear the fissures forming in that rigid psyche of his.‚Äù     The Chimera nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYes but we must be cautious. Push too hard too fast and his mind might shatter completely. We want to remake him not destroy him utterly.‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes waved a dismissive hand. ‚ÄúDetails details. Just keep pushing my dear Chimera. I want to see what lurks in the deepest darkest corners of the Bat‚Äôs mind.‚Äù     As they spoke neither noticed the small drone hovering outside the window its camera capturing every moment of their sinister collaboration.     * * *     Hannah Sarah and Samantha crouched in the shadows outside the old Arkham Asylum their eyes fixed on the crumbling structure before them.     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm picking up heat signatures on the top floor‚Äù Hannah whispered consulting a handheld device. ‚ÄúLooks like that‚Äôs where they‚Äôre keeping him.‚Äù     Sarah nodded her grip tightening on her escrima sticks. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the plan? We can‚Äôt just burst in there. Who knows what they‚Äôve done to Batman‚Äôs mind by now.‚Äù     Samantha‚Äôs eyes narrowed behind her mask. ‚ÄúWe need a distraction. Something to draw their attention while we extract Batman.‚Äù     Hannah‚Äôs lips curled into a grim smile. ‚ÄúI think I have just the thing. But you‚Äôre not going to like it.‚Äù     As she outlined her plan Sarah and Samantha exchanged worried glances. It was risky borderline insane. But then again in a city like Gotham sometimes insanity was the only sane response.     * * *     Deep in the labyrinth of his own mind Batman stumbled through a nightmare version of Crime Alley. The walls seemed to weep blood and every shadow held a pair of gleaming malevolent eyes.     ‚ÄúWhy do you keep fighting Bruce?‚Äù a voice whispered on the wind. Batman turned to see his parents standing before him their forms flickering like old film.     ‚ÄúMom? Dad?‚Äù he croaked his voice breaking.     Thomas Wayne‚Äôs face twisted into a sneer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve failed us son. Failed Gotham. Look around you ‚Äì the city is as dark and corrupt as ever.‚Äù     ‚ÄúNo‚Äù Batman protested shaking his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made a difference. I‚Äôve saved lives.‚Äù     Martha Wayne‚Äôs laugh was cold and cruel. ‚ÄúSaved lives? Oh Bruce. How many have died because of your crusade? How many have suffered because you refuse to do what‚Äôs necessary?‚Äù     As his parents‚Äô accusations rained down upon him Batman felt something inside him begin to crack. A small part of his mind screamed that this wasn‚Äôt real that it was all a toxin-induced nightmare. But the doubt the guilt the fear ‚Äì it all felt so terribly painfully real.     * * *     In the control room The Chimera‚Äôs eyes widened as they studied the readouts. ‚ÄúRemarkable‚Äù they breathed. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs accessing trauma so deeply buried I doubt even he was fully aware of it.‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes leaned in close her breath hot on The Chimera‚Äôs neck. ‚ÄúAnd what do we do with all this delicious trauma my dear?‚Äù     The Chimera‚Äôs fingers danced across the controls. ‚ÄúWe amplify it. We twist it. And then when he‚Äôs at his most vulnerable we offer him a way out. A new identity free from all that pain and guilt.‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes‚Äô grin was positively feral. ‚ÄúA new Clown Prince of Crime. Oh I do love poetry in motion.‚Äù     Suddenly alarms began to blare throughout the asylum. The Chimera‚Äôs head snapped up their eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúWe have intruders.‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes‚Äô face darkened. ‚ÄúDeal with them. I don‚Äôt care how. Just make sure our performance isn‚Äôt interrupted.‚Äù     As The Chimera hurried from the room Ms. Rhymes turned back to the monitors her eyes fixed on Batman‚Äôs twisting form. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just you and me now my dark muse. Let‚Äôs see what other horrors we can conjure up shall we?‚Äù     * * *     Outside Arkham chaos reigned. Hannah‚Äôs ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù had taken the form of a series of explosions around the perimeter of the asylum each one timed to draw attention away from their true goal.     As Rhymes‚Äô goons scrambled to respond to the perceived attack Samantha Sarah and Hannah slipped inside through a service entrance.     ‚ÄúRemember‚Äù Samantha whispered as they made their way through the asylum‚Äôs twisted corridors ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know what state Batman will be in when we find him. Be prepared for anything.‚Äù     Sarah nodded grimly. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just hope we‚Äôre not too late.‚Äù     As they ascended to the upper floors the sounds of conflict echoed through the building. Hannah‚Äôs lips curved into a small smile. ‚ÄúSounds like our diversion is working.‚Äù     Suddenly a figure stepped out of the shadows before them. The Chimera their mask seeming to ripple in the dim light.     ‚ÄúWell‚Äù The Chimera said their voice a disorienting blend of tones ‚Äúit seems we have some uninvited guests. How‚Ä¶ intriguing.‚Äù     Samantha stepped forward her baseball bat held at the ready. ‚ÄúStand aside. We‚Äôre here for Batman.‚Äù     The Chimera tilted their head the gesture unnervingly birdlike. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt allow that. You see we‚Äôre in the middle of a very delicate procedure. Any interruption could be‚Ä¶ catastrophic.‚Äù     Without warning The Chimera lashed out a spray of some unknown substance erupting from their sleeve. Samantha managed to dodge but Hannah and Sarah weren‚Äôt as lucky. As the mist enveloped them their eyes widened in horror.     ‚ÄúRun!‚Äù Samantha shouted charging at The Chimera. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hold them off! Find Batman!‚Äù     As Samantha engaged The Chimera in a fierce battle Hannah and Sarah stumbled away their minds already beginning to cloud with hallucinations.     ‚ÄúWe have to‚Ä¶ have to keep going‚Äù Hannah gasped her vision swimming. ‚ÄúBatman‚Ä¶ we need to‚Ä¶‚Äù     Sarah gripped her partner‚Äôs hand tightly. ‚ÄúTogether‚Äù she said firmly. ‚ÄúWhatever happens we face it together.‚Äù     As they staggered down the corridor the walls seemed to breathe and pulse around them The Chimera‚Äôs toxin taking full effect. But still they pressed on driven by a determination that ran deeper than any fear.     * * *     In the depths of his fractured psyche Batman found himself standing atop Wayne Tower the city spread out before him like a diseased corpse. The sky above was a roiling mass of green and purple punctuated by flashes of sickly lightning.     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite a view isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù a voice said from behind him. Batman turned to see the Joker standing there but this time the clown‚Äôs face was a perfect mirror of his own.     ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what is this?‚Äù Batman growled his voice hoarse.     The Joker-Batman grinned the expression grotesque on the familiar features. ‚ÄúThis is liberation Brucie! This is what happens when you finally let go of all that guilt all that responsibility. When you embrace the joke that is existence!‚Äù     Batman shook his head trying to clear the fog from his mind. ‚ÄúNo. This isn‚Äôt real. I would never‚Ä¶‚Äù     ‚ÄúOh but you would‚Äù the Joker-Batman cackled. ‚ÄúYou will! Think about it ‚Äì how many times have you been one bad day away from becoming just like the monsters you fight? How thin is that line you walk?‚Äù     As the Joker-Batman‚Äôs words washed over him Batman felt something deep inside beginning to give way. The weight of his mission the endless parade of tragedy and horror he‚Äôd witnessed ‚Äì it all came crashing down at once.     And for the first time in as long as he could remember Batman began to laugh.     * * *     In the control room Ms. Rhymes watched the monitors with growing excitement. ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù she crowed. ‚ÄúYes that‚Äôs it! Laugh my dark knight! Embrace the madness!‚Äù     She was so engrossed in the spectacle before her that she didn‚Äôt notice the door opening behind her. Hannah and Sarah their minds still reeling from The Chimera‚Äôs toxin stumbled into the room.     ‚ÄúStop‚Ä¶ stop this‚Äù Hannah gasped her voice barely above a whisper.     Ms. Rhymes spun around her eyes widening in surprise before narrowing in anger. ‚ÄúYou! How did you get past The Chimera?‚Äù     Sarah raised her escrima sticks though her hands shook with the effort. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôre here to stop you.‚Äù     A cruel smile spread across Ms. Rhymes‚Äô face. ‚ÄúOh my dears. You‚Äôre far too late for that. Batman is already falling. Soon he‚Äôll be reborn as Gotham‚Äôs new agent of chaos. And there‚Äôs nothing you can do to stop it.‚Äù     As if to punctuate her words Batman‚Äôs laughter echoed through the room growing louder and more unhinged with each passing moment.     Hannah and Sarah exchanged a desperate look. They were running out of time.     * * *     In the corridor outside Samantha and The Chimera continued their fierce battle. The Chimera‚Äôs fighting style was a disorienting blend of techniques their body seeming to flow like water around Samantha‚Äôs attacks.     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good‚Äù The Chimera said their voice a mix of admiration and malice. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre fighting for the wrong side. Can‚Äôt you see the beauty in what we‚Äôre creating?‚Äù     Samantha‚Äôs eyes narrowed behind her mask. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no beauty in breaking a warrior‚Äôs mind. Only cowardice.‚Äù     The Chimera laughed the sound echoing off the asylum‚Äôs walls. ‚ÄúOh my dear. We‚Äôre not breaking his mind. We‚Äôre setting it free!‚Äù     As they fought the sounds of Batman‚Äôs laughter grew louder more manic. Samantha felt a chill run down her spine. They were running out of time.     * * *     In the twisted landscape of his mind Batman stood on the edge of Wayne Tower teetering between sanity and madness. The Joker-Batman stood beside him arm draped over his shoulders like an old friend.     ‚ÄúCome on Brucie‚Äù the Joker-Batman cajoled. ‚ÄúOne little step. That‚Äôs all it takes. One step and all the pain all the responsibility ‚Äì it all goes away. Isn‚Äôt that what you‚Äôve always wanted?‚Äù     Batman looked out over the nightmare version of Gotham his mind a whirlwind of conflicting thoughts and emotions. Part of him knew this wasn‚Äôt real that it was all a toxin-induced hallucination. But another part a part that had been buried deep for so long whispered that maybe just maybe this was the answer he‚Äôd been looking for all along.     *****     Batman stood on the precipice both literally and figuratively. The Joker-Batman‚Äôs words echoed in his mind a siren song of chaos and release. For a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity he teetered on the edge.     Then with a laugh that started low and grew into a manic cackle Batman stepped off the ledge.     As he fell through the nightmare cityscape his laughter echoed off the twisted buildings. The world around him began to blur and shift colors swirling together in a dizzying kaleidoscope of madness.     * * *     In the control room Ms. Rhymes watched the monitors with growing excitement. ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù she crowed. ‚ÄúYes that‚Äôs it! Fall my dark knight! Fall into the abyss of chaos!‚Äù     Hannah and Sarah still fighting against the effects of The Chimera‚Äôs toxin struggled to make sense of what they were seeing.     ‚ÄúWe have to‚Ä¶ have to stop this‚Äù Hannah gasped her vision swimming.     Sarah reached out gripping her partner‚Äôs hand tightly. ‚ÄúHow? We can barely stand‚Ä¶‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes turned to them her eyes glittering with malicious glee. ‚ÄúOh my dears. You can‚Äôt stop this. You‚Äôre witnessing the birth of a new era for Gotham. The fall of its greatest hero‚Ä¶ and the rise of its most terrifying villain!‚Äù     * * *     Outside in the corridor Samantha and The Chimera‚Äôs battle had reached a fever pitch. Both combatants were showing signs of fatigue but neither was willing to give an inch.     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fighting a losing battle‚Äù The Chimera panted their mask seeming to ripple with each breath. ‚ÄúEven if you defeat me you can‚Äôt undo what‚Äôs been done to Batman‚Äôs mind.‚Äù     Samantha‚Äôs eyes narrowed behind her mask. ‚ÄúMaybe not. But I can make sure you pay for what you‚Äôve done.‚Äù     With a burst of speed Samantha feinted left then brought her baseball bat around in a vicious arc. The Chimera caught off guard couldn‚Äôt dodge in time. The bat connected with their mask with a sickening crunch.     The Chimera stumbled back their mask cracking and falling away in pieces. As it did Samantha‚Äôs eyes widened in shock.     ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre‚Ä¶‚Äù     But before she could finish The Chimera lashed out with a hidden blade forcing Samantha back. Taking advantage of her momentary surprise they turned and fled down the corridor.     Samantha hesitated for a moment torn between pursuit and the need to help Batman. With a growl of frustration she turned towards the control room. Batman had to be the priority.     * * *     In the swirling vortex of his mind Batman continued to fall. As he did he felt his very identity begin to unravel. Memories flashed before his eyes ‚Äì his parents‚Äô murder his years of training his countless battles to protect Gotham. But now each memory was tinged with a manic hilarity as if every tragedy in his life had suddenly become the punchline to some cosmic joke.     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it Brucie!‚Äù the Joker-Batman‚Äôs voice echoed around him. ‚ÄúLet it all go! Embrace the madness!‚Äù     As he fell deeper into the abyss of his own psyche Batman felt something fundamental shifting within him. The rigid moral code that had defined him for so long began to crack and splinter.     And still he laughed.     * * *     In the control room the tension had reached a breaking point. Ms. Rhymes stood before the monitors her arms spread wide as if conducting some twisted symphony. Hannah and Sarah still reeling from The Chimera‚Äôs toxin struggled to formulate a plan.     Suddenly the door burst open and Samantha charged in her baseball bat at the ready.     ‚ÄúStep away from the controls‚Äù she growled.     Ms. Rhymes spun around her eyes widening in surprise before narrowing in anger. ‚ÄúRevan‚Ä¶ or should I say Samantha? I must admit I‚Äôm disappointed. I thought you understood the beauty of what we‚Äôre creating here.‚Äù     Samantha‚Äôs grip tightened on her bat. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no beauty in this. Only madness and pain.‚Äù     As they faced off the room filled with the sound of Batman‚Äôs laughter growing louder and more unhinged with each passing moment.     Hannah fighting through the haze of the toxin stumbled towards the controls. ‚ÄúWe have to‚Ä¶ have to shut it down‚Ä¶‚Äù     But before she could reach them Ms. Rhymes pulled out a small remote. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that if I were you‚Äù she said her voice dripping with malice. ‚ÄúOne push of this button and Batman‚Äôs mind is wiped clean. Everything he was everything he believed in ‚Äì gone in an instant.‚Äù     The room froze the tension palpable. Samantha‚Äôs eyes darted between Ms. Rhymes and the monitors showing Batman‚Äôs writhing form. Sarah supporting a still-woozy Hannah glared at the madwoman before them.     ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù Samantha asked her voice tight.     Ms. Rhymes‚Äô smile was all teeth. ‚ÄúWant? My dear I want what I‚Äôve always wanted. To show Gotham ‚Äì to show the world ‚Äì the true face of chaos. And what better way to do that than to turn its greatest protector into its worst nightmare?‚Äù     As she spoke the monitors behind her flickered. Batman‚Äôs laughter had reached a fever pitch and suddenly it cut off. The silence that followed was deafening.     All eyes turned to the screens. Batman‚Äôs body had gone still his face hidden in shadow.     ‚ÄúNo‚Äù Sarah whispered her eyes wide with horror.     Ms. Rhymes‚Äô grin widened. ‚ÄúYes. Watch closely my dears. You‚Äôre about to witness the rebirth of a legend.‚Äù     * * *     In the depths of his fractured psyche Batman stood in a void. The swirling chaos around him had stilled leaving him in a space of perfect empty blackness.     ‚ÄúSo‚Äù he said his voice echoing in the emptiness ‚Äúthis is madness.‚Äù     The Joker-Batman appeared before him but now instead of a mirror image it was a swirling ever-changing figure ‚Äì sometimes the Joker sometimes Batman sometimes a nightmarish blend of the two.     ‚ÄúNot madness Brucie‚Äù it said its voice a cacophony of laughter and growls. ‚ÄúClarity. You‚Äôve finally seen the joke that is existence. The futility of your crusade. The utter absurdity of it all.‚Äù     Batman looked down at his hands watching as his costume began to shift and change colors bleeding and swirling.     ‚ÄúAnd now?‚Äù he asked his voice utterly calm.     The figure before him grinned the expression stretching beyond the limits of a human face. ‚ÄúNow you become what you were always meant to be. Gotham‚Äôs darkest knight. Its clown prince of crime. Its harbinger of beautiful perfect chaos.‚Äù     As the words washed over him Batman felt the last vestiges of his old self falling away. In its place rose something new. Something terrifying. Something‚Ä¶ free.     He threw back his head and laughed the sound echoing through the void and beyond into the world of the waking.     * * *     In the control room all eyes were fixed on the monitors as Batman‚Äôs body began to stir. Slowly he sat up his movements fluid and unnaturally graceful.     ‚ÄúNo‚Äù Samantha breathed her bat slipping from nerveless fingers. ‚ÄúWhat have you done?‚Äù     Ms. Rhymes‚Äô eyes gleamed with triumph. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve given Gotham its new god of chaos. Behold the birth of a legend!‚Äù     On the screen Batman turned towards the camera. As his face came into view a collective gasp filled the room. His cowl had split and peeled back revealing a face that was a nightmarish blend of Batman and the Joker. His skin was pale almost white with streaks of black that mimicked the design of his cowl. His lips were stretched in a grin that was too wide too full of teeth to be natural.     But it was his eyes that truly chilled the blood. They burned with a manic intensity swirling with colors that shouldn‚Äôt exist in nature.     When he spoke his voice was a blend of Batman‚Äôs gravelly growl and the Joker‚Äôs high-pitched cackle. ‚ÄúGotham‚Äù he said his grin widening impossibly further ‚Äúyour Dark Knight has fallen. But fear not ‚Äì a new protector rises. One who understands that the only way to save this city‚Ä¶ is to embrace the madness.‚Äù     He stood his costume rippling and changing. The blacks and greys bled into purples and greens while still maintaining the silhouette of the Bat. The result was a terrifying fusion of Batman and the Joker a creature of nightmare made flesh.     ‚ÄúThe joke‚Äôs on you Gotham‚Äù he continued spreading his arms wide. ‚ÄúYou thought you needed a hero. But what you really need‚Ä¶ is a little chaos.‚Äù     With that he threw back his head and laughed. It was a sound that contained multitudes ‚Äì the deep restrained chuckle of Bruce Wayne the gravelly growl of Batman the manic cackle of the Joker and something else. Something new and terrifying.     In the control room Ms. Rhymes drank in the sight with undisguised glee. ‚ÄúBeautiful‚Äù she breathed. ‚ÄúAbsolutely beautiful.‚Äù     Samantha Hannah and Sarah watched in horror the full weight of their failure crashing down upon them. They had come to save Batman to stop Ms. Rhymes‚Äô plan. Instead they had witnessed the fall of Gotham‚Äôs greatest hero and the birth of its most terrifying villain.     As the newly reborn Batman-Joker hybrid continued to laugh his voice echoing through the asylum and beyond a chill ran down the spines of all who heard it. For in that laugh was a promise ‚Äì a promise of chaos of madness of a Gotham reshaped in the image of its fallen hero.     The Dark Knight had fallen. And in his place rose something far deadlier ‚Äì a creature of shadow and laughter of justice twisted into madness. Gotham‚Äôs new Clown Prince of Crime had arrived.     And the city would never be the same again.     As the screens went dark plunging the control room into shadows broken only by the eerie glow of emergency lights Ms. Rhymes turned to her stunned audience her eyes gleaming with triumphant madness.     ‚ÄúAnd so‚Äù she said her voice dripping with malicious glee ‚Äúthe curtain falls on this act of our grand performance. But fear not my dears. The show is far from over. In fact‚Ä¶‚Äù Her grin widened becoming something feral and terrifying. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only just beginning.‚Äù     The asylum echoed with the sound of mad laughter ‚Äì Ms. Rhymes‚Äô the newly reborn Batman‚Äôs and perhaps most chillingly of all the laughter of a city teetering on the brink of total chaos.     In the growing darkness as the weight of their failure pressed down upon them Samantha Hannah and Sarah exchanged grim looks. They had lost this battle but the war for Gotham‚Äôs soul was far from over.     The question now was: in a city without its Dark Knight who would rise to face the coming storm?,2024-07-13 12:55:59 GMT

42,Batman,['my adventures with superman'  'dc comics'  'robin'  'story ideas'],jeeperso,My Adventures With Batman If its one thing we know about the western animation industry its that genuinely original and creative efforts are quickly followed by spinoffs bandwagon jumpers and out-and-out ripoffs  so let‚Äôs take the latest DC Animation darling My Adventures With Superman  for those unfamiliar MAWS is a ground-up reboot of the Superman Mythos that‚Äôs as much a romantic &amp; buddy comedy as it is superheroic drama. It is quite good and I reccommend you watch it.  Naturally one of THE anticipated events for future seasons will be when Batman inevitably shows up which got me thinking on well the equally inevitable Batman spinoff which well see the title of this post.  and here‚Äôs the thing: Its doable?  How do I know because we‚Äôve seen it be done. At least thrice in fact but for simplicity‚Äôs sake lets stick with the most tumblr gif friendly option: The Lego Batman Movie  that is to say my hypothetical MAWB would through its first season anyway deal with Bruce Wayne trying to juggle not only being both Batman and Brucie Wayne Millionaire Playboy but now newly-adoptive father to his young ward Dick Grayson.  Batman: The Brave &amp; The Bold gave us a good starting template as well making Bruce the stoic yet exasperated straight man to the antics of Gotham City‚Äôs collection of rogues and eccentrics and the bitter truth that accepting Robin as his sidekick somehow puts Dick in Less Peril   ‚ÄúAt least this way I can keep an eye on him Alfred‚Äù  ‚ÄúOf course sir I thought the same thing during your ninja phase.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a phase it was training alfred.‚Äù  ‚Äúwait‚Äù pause both Bruce and alfred yelp ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a ninja?‚Äù  as for Dick well he‚Äôs the deuteragonist he‚Äôs taking things in surprising stride and well see all those posts around this hellsite about how he‚Äôs able to somehow get along with the various rogues and drive them to distraction.  as for antagonists the one with lots of potential is of all people Killer Croc as both he and dick were circus folk.

I was really iffy when it came to comic books then I read the White Knight because of these videos and my brain chemistry changed. I love comic books now. Same for my interest in roleplay games i honestly didn‚Äôt like them and found them boring then I played the Batman telltale games because of these videos. I love roleplaying games now.  I started falling in love with comic book art and I had a new drive to draw and I might want to pursue a career doing comic book art if I‚Äôm able.  I know this is all very silly because of what those videos actually are but my relationship with art books characters video games and media overall changed 3 years ago.

'low budget batman'],peerlesshamster,the argument that Bruce would never be Batman or wouldn‚Äôt hold his ideals if he wasn‚Äôt wealthy is kinda dumb imo.  I think that one of the biggest differences it‚Äôd make it‚Äôs making him more close to middle and low class Gothamites and their struggles he‚Äôd be more of a detective and hero for the people.  Then he‚Äôd find a way to have the same/similar training during the years he‚Äôd be gone from Gotham (he‚Äôd acquire some crazy dad lore).   Then he wouldn‚Äôt adopt but he‚Äôd take him under his wing an older and angrier Dick who‚Äôs set on revenge and getting his ass kicked by criminals. With Jason it‚Äôd be slightly similar but instead of training he‚Äôd give him a small job to do instead of stealing (most likely he‚Äôd have a place where to teach self defense or be a mechanic that has plenty side jobs). The other kids acquisition/introduction to vigilantism would be pretty close to canon though.  Since he probably would try to keep a low profile and be less batman and work as bruce most of the time the Batman would be more of a legend and wouldn‚Äôt meet other heroes for quite a while.  Also let‚Äôs not forget that Gotham would lack the work that Bruce Wayne does as Bruce Wayne so it‚Äôd be interesting to see how his absence would affect the city.,2024-07-13 19:17:07 GMT

34,Batman,['dc comics'  'dc'  'batfamily'],dr-tyme,Some Cool Things I‚Äôd Like to Share Ok so I‚Äôm kind of obsessive about continuity and reading characters with long histories ‚Äúin order.‚Äù This has recently manifested in me attempting to read the entire Post-Crisis history of Batman and all his little Gotham people. I specifically wanted to read it all in order of publication not in the ‚Äútimeline‚Äù order that you can find in all the reading orders online where ‚ÄúYear One‚Äù style comics like Matt Wagner‚Äôs Mad Monk retelling or The Long Halloween will be among the first comics on the list because of how early they are in Bruce‚Äôs career. Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with those lists I‚Äôm just weird and particular. So after searching for ages to try to find this magic list that would meet all of my weird needs (and finding nothing) I decided I would make my own. So finally after like 10 lines of reading here‚Äôs the point of this post: a 3000+ cell Google Spreadsheet of every single Batfamily title and notable storyline from mid-1986 to September 2011. This took me a full week to make and I tried really hard to include everything. Every main title mini-series and one-shot; in order of publication. And it‚Äôs color-coded. Here are the guidelines I used while making it if anyone is still reading:  I tried to keep it fairly ‚Äúarc‚Äù based so as not to break up storylines. I didn‚Äôt want a reader to have to switch to a different title every single issue. No ‚Äúmajor‚Äù team-ups. Basically this means no Justice League Young Justice Teen Titans etc. (with the exception of Outsiders from 2008 as it ties in to Bruce‚Äôs death and all of the aftermath). World‚Äôs Finest/Trinity stuff is fair game and was included though. I am totally open to criticism/suggestions. If anyone ever sees this and then if they click the link on top of that and see something they don‚Äôt like or they think should change get in touch! I‚Äôm open to changing anything and the majority of the list consists of comics that I haven‚Äôt even read so I can‚Äôt check the validity of their placement. Please tell me if you see something I screwed up. Ok that‚Äôs it I can‚Äôt think of anything else important so enjoy if you choose to look at my fun little list. I have ADHD and suffer intense hyperfixations so hopefully that provides the real explanation for why I did this. I really gotta work on making shorter posts.,2024-07-13 23:50:30 GMT

1,Batman,['dc comics'  'batfamily'  'doom patrol'],dr-tyme,Hi Alright so if I want to make this a real blog I guess I have to post. So I guess I should say some introductory stuff for the 3 people who will see this or whatever.  This is basically going to be a fun little comic blog where I post my thoughts on characters I like or whatever I happen to be reading.   I can‚Äôt think of how to structure this post any further so I‚Äôm just going to list things that are probably relevant.  I‚Äôm a huge DC Comics fan have been since I was 11 (I‚Äôm 19 now) but I‚Äôve always loved superheroes I really love the Doom Patrol. Comics show everything. They‚Äôre my favorites and Rebis is my favorite character like ever. I do still like Marvel mainly Spider-Man Daredevil and the X-Men are the guys I‚Äôm super invested in on that side.

In my case I don‚Äôt really have a favourite Joker (for now) because I find most interpretations interesting but this guy will always have a special place in my heart:  I discovered the Joker and part of Batman‚Äôs lore with the Lego Batman games and this version laid the foundations of what I appreciate in a Joker namely humour smile (it may be funny but many tend to forget these two elements) insolence intelligence/ingenuity unpredictability the fact that he‚Äôs always one step ahead of everyone else his class his vicious side both narcissistic and selfless and of course his relationship with Batman; that it‚Äôs written like a romance that his affection for him is both obvious and subtle and that he refuses to kill him because otherwise his life wouldn‚Äôt be funny anymore.

34,Batman,['dc comics'  'dc'  'batfamily'],dr-tyme,Some Cool Things I‚Äôd Like to Share Ok so I‚Äôm kind of obsessive about continuity and reading characters with long histories ‚Äúin order.‚Äù This has recently manifested in me attempting to read the entire Post-Crisis history of Batman and all his little Gotham people. I specifically wanted to read it all in order of publication not in the ‚Äútimeline‚Äù order that you can find in all the reading orders online where ‚ÄúYear One‚Äù style comics like Matt Wagner‚Äôs Mad Monk retelling or The Long Halloween will be among the first comics on the list because of how early they are in Bruce‚Äôs career. Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with those lists I‚Äôm just weird and particular. So after searching for ages to try to find this magic list that would meet all of my weird needs (and finding nothing) I decided I would make my own. So finally after like 10 lines of reading here‚Äôs the point of this post: a 3000+ cell Google Spreadsheet of every single Batfamily title and notable storyline from mid-1986 to September 2011. This took me a full week to make and I tried really hard to include everything. Every main title mini-series and one-shot; in order of publication. And it‚Äôs color-coded. Here are the guidelines I used while making it if anyone is still reading:  I tried to keep it fairly ‚Äúarc‚Äù based so as not to break up storylines. I didn‚Äôt want a reader to have to switch to a different title every single issue. No ‚Äúmajor‚Äù team-ups. Basically this means no Justice League Young Justice Teen Titans etc. (with the exception of Outsiders from 2008 as it ties in to Bruce‚Äôs death and all of the aftermath). World‚Äôs Finest/Trinity stuff is fair game and was included though. I am totally open to criticism/suggestions. If anyone ever sees this and then if they click the link on top of that and see something they don‚Äôt like or they think should change get in touch! I‚Äôm open to changing anything and the majority of the list consists of comics that I haven‚Äôt even read so I can‚Äôt check the validity of their placement. Please tell me if you see something I screwed up. Ok that‚Äôs it I can‚Äôt think of anything else important so enjoy if you choose to look at my fun little list. I have ADHD and suffer intense hyperfixations so hopefully that provides the real explanation for why I did this. I really gotta work on making shorter posts.,2024-07-13 23:50:30 GMT

34,Batman,['dc comics'  'dc'  'batfamily'],dr-tyme,Some Cool Things I‚Äôd Like to Share Ok so I‚Äôm kind of obsessive about continuity and reading characters with long histories ‚Äúin order.‚Äù This has recently manifested in me attempting to read the entire Post-Crisis history of Batman and all his little Gotham people. I specifically wanted to read it all in order of publication not in the ‚Äútimeline‚Äù order that you can find in all the reading orders online where ‚ÄúYear One‚Äù style comics like Matt Wagner‚Äôs Mad Monk retelling or The Long Halloween will be among the first comics on the list because of how early they are in Bruce‚Äôs career. Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with those lists I‚Äôm just weird and particular. So after searching for ages to try to find this magic list that would meet all of my weird needs (and finding nothing) I decided I would make my own. So finally after like 10 lines of reading here‚Äôs the point of this post: a 3000+ cell Google Spreadsheet of every single Batfamily title and notable storyline from mid-1986 to September 2011. This took me a full week to make and I tried really hard to include everything. Every main title mini-series and one-shot; in order of publication. And it‚Äôs color-coded. Here are the guidelines I used while making it if anyone is still reading:  I tried to keep it fairly ‚Äúarc‚Äù based so as not to break up storylines. I didn‚Äôt want a reader to have to switch to a different title every single issue. No ‚Äúmajor‚Äù team-ups. Basically this means no Justice League Young Justice Teen Titans etc. (with the exception of Outsiders from 2008 as it ties in to Bruce‚Äôs death and all of the aftermath). World‚Äôs Finest/Trinity stuff is fair game and was included though. I am totally open to criticism/suggestions. If anyone ever sees this and then if they click the link on top of that and see something they don‚Äôt like or they think should change get in touch! I‚Äôm open to changing anything and the majority of the list consists of comics that I haven‚Äôt even read so I can‚Äôt check the validity of their placement. Please tell me if you see something I screwed up. Ok that‚Äôs it I can‚Äôt think of anything else important so enjoy if you choose to look at my fun little list. I have ADHD and suffer intense hyperfixations so hopefully that provides the real explanation for why I did this. I really gotta work on making shorter posts.,2024-07-13 23:50:30 GMT

Children given weapons and permission to right wrongs as they saw fit. Little soldiers in an endless crusade for justice.  But you should have seen ‚Äòem.  The first well he was a showman to the core. He was a performer- all dazzling smiles and extra flips. His adoring audience those he saved gained protection forevermore and (arguably more importantly) hope. He was a hero- and lives were saved behind his little golden cape.  The second a smaller boy was a fighter. He was passionate- a force of nature sent to make Batman laugh and villains cower. He ran the rooftops dropping in on homeless camps and doing bed checks on the street kids. He defended the weak- he grinned boldly in the face of danger (he carried on his predecessor‚Äôs legacy). He was a protector- and lives were saved behind his little golden cape.  The third a lanky thing was a strategist. He was calculating- a whirlwind of snark and careful planning. He largely stuck to the shadows keeping Batman in check and investigating. He stopped villains on their way to commit crimes- he patrolled the worst parts of Gotham (carrying on his predecessor‚Äôs legacy). He was a detective- and lives were saved with every glimpse of his little golden cape.  The fourth a girl strangely enough was a menace. She was vibrant- a flash of blonde hair and skillful violence. She capitalized on the bright lights of dark alleys and made herself known. She helped victims make their way to clinics and shelters- she destroyed criminal enterprises on whims (carrying on her predecessor‚Äôs legacy). She was a force- and lives were saved in the shine of her golden cape.  The fifth another slip of a thing was potentially demonic. He was a terror- a glint of a blade and caustic remarks. He slunk through the shadows lingering in the one cast by Batman. The violence left in his path made those who would hurt others tremble. He trussed up meta villains with ease- he collected names from shelters and served justice and vengeance without issue (carrying on his predecessor‚Äôs legacy). He was an avenging angel- and lives were saved with every soft flutter of his little golden cape.  Each one vanished- replaced and never seen again. A chasm of fear and grief left in their wake felt in every person who found solace in their little golden capes.  But you should have seen &#x27;em.,2024-07-14 02:31:20 GMT

Children given weapons and permission to right wrongs as they saw fit. Little soldiers in an endless crusade for justice.  But you should have seen ‚Äòem.  The first well he was a showman to the core. He was a performer- all dazzling smiles and extra flips. His adoring audience those he saved gained protection forevermore and (arguably more importantly) hope. He was a hero- and lives were saved behind his little golden cape.  The second a smaller boy was a fighter. He was passionate- a force of nature sent to make Batman laugh and villains cower. He ran the rooftops dropping in on homeless camps and doing bed checks on the street kids. He defended the weak- he grinned boldly in the face of danger (he carried on his predecessor‚Äôs legacy). He was a protector- and lives were saved behind his little golden cape.  The third a lanky thing was a strategist. He was calculating- a whirlwind of snark and careful planning. He largely stuck to the shadows keeping Batman in check and investigating. He stopped villains on their way to commit crimes- he patrolled the worst parts of Gotham (carrying on his predecessor‚Äôs legacy). He was a detective- and lives were saved with every glimpse of his little golden cape.  The fourth a girl strangely enough was a menace. She was vibrant- a flash of blonde hair and skillful violence. She capitalized on the bright lights of dark alleys and made herself known. She helped victims make their way to clinics and shelters- she destroyed criminal enterprises on whims (carrying on her predecessor‚Äôs legacy). She was a force- and lives were saved in the shine of her golden cape.  The fifth another slip of a thing was potentially demonic. He was a terror- a glint of a blade and caustic remarks. He slunk through the shadows lingering in the one cast by Batman. The violence left in his path made those who would hurt others tremble. He trussed up meta villains with ease- he collected names from shelters and served justice and vengeance without issue (carrying on his predecessor‚Äôs legacy). He was an avenging angel- and lives were saved with every soft flutter of his little golden cape.  Each one vanished- replaced and never seen again. A chasm of fear and grief left in their wake felt in every person who found solace in their little golden capes.  But you should have seen &#x27;em.,2024-07-14 02:31:20 GMT

What if besides death followed by resurrection via a source of ectoplasm a human-ghost hybrid could also be created She Hulk style. And by that I mean the old school comics. Not that spiteful heap of garbage masquerading as a tv adaptation made by that toxically bitter hack Jessica Gao.  This can be applied to whatever hero/villain you choose I‚Äôm going with Batman. Mostly because I haven‚Äôt seen many half ghost Bruce Wayne posts.  Anyway the scenario starts off with Alfred finding Danny roaming the streets in search of food due to running away from foster care. (Jack and Maddy left him there in the hopes of keeping him safe from the GIW after Wes finally succeeded in outing him to all of Amity) And through lots of gentle coaxing convinces him to let Alfred take him home.  Eventually Danny gets so attached he readily agrees to being adopted into the Wayne family by Alfred. Once enough trust has been built overtime to share identities Gotham automatically gains a new protector.  Then the further establishment of new relationships is suddenly interrupted by a full-scale alien invasion requiring all hands on deck. Though all the heroes manage to hold their own for the most part it quickly becomes clear they may not win this battle if they don‚Äôt find something to turn the tide in their favor.  They get that something in the form of Phantom rallying all his ghost allies/frenemies to join the fight. With their added power the entirety of the alien army is thoroughly beaten back. But not before Batman takes a hit hard enough to cause him to bleed out at an alarming rate.  The already dire situation worsens all the more when it‚Äôs discovered that Batman is a rare blood type and no one in the batclan or even the other human heroes matches. All save for Phantom. Problem is with all that ecto mixed with his blood a transfusion could possibly poison or worse kill his big brother. Everyone is aware of this. But any other option would take too long and Batman doesn‚Äôt have much time left.  So with bated breath and reluctance Phantom gives his blood. For a few scary minutes it looks like Batman might be showing signs of rejection. But then he slowly begins to stabilize giving the medical team much needed breathing room to get him properly tended to.   While Bats may be on the mend no one‚Äôs relaxing just yet. And not for a lack of trying. It‚Äôs just a little hard to be chill when Mr. Dark and Broody has started randomly going invisible or intangible speaking with an echo levitating over his bed and overall become creepily unsettling to look at. Especially with that unnatural glow in his eyes.,2024-07-14 04:12:37 GMT

What if besides death followed by resurrection via a source of ectoplasm a human-ghost hybrid could also be created She Hulk style. And by that I mean the old school comics. Not that spiteful heap of garbage masquerading as a tv adaptation made by that toxically bitter hack Jessica Gao.  This can be applied to whatever hero/villain you choose I‚Äôm going with Batman. Mostly because I haven‚Äôt seen many half ghost Bruce Wayne posts.  Anyway the scenario starts off with Alfred finding Danny roaming the streets in search of food due to running away from foster care. (Jack and Maddy left him there in the hopes of keeping him safe from the GIW after Wes finally succeeded in outing him to all of Amity) And through lots of gentle coaxing convinces him to let Alfred take him home.  Eventually Danny gets so attached he readily agrees to being adopted into the Wayne family by Alfred. Once enough trust has been built overtime to share identities Gotham automatically gains a new protector.  Then the further establishment of new relationships is suddenly interrupted by a full-scale alien invasion requiring all hands on deck. Though all the heroes manage to hold their own for the most part it quickly becomes clear they may not win this battle if they don‚Äôt find something to turn the tide in their favor.  They get that something in the form of Phantom rallying all his ghost allies/frenemies to join the fight. With their added power the entirety of the alien army is thoroughly beaten back. But not before Batman takes a hit hard enough to cause him to bleed out at an alarming rate.  The already dire situation worsens all the more when it‚Äôs discovered that Batman is a rare blood type and no one in the batclan or even the other human heroes matches. All save for Phantom. Problem is with all that ecto mixed with his blood a transfusion could possibly poison or worse kill his big brother. Everyone is aware of this. But any other option would take too long and Batman doesn‚Äôt have much time left.  So with bated breath and reluctance Phantom gives his blood. For a few scary minutes it looks like Batman might be showing signs of rejection. But then he slowly begins to stabilize giving the medical team much needed breathing room to get him properly tended to.   While Bats may be on the mend no one‚Äôs relaxing just yet. And not for a lack of trying. It‚Äôs just a little hard to be chill when Mr. Dark and Broody has started randomly going invisible or intangible speaking with an echo levitating over his bed and overall become creepily unsettling to look at. Especially with that unnatural glow in his eyes.,2024-07-14 04:12:37 GMT

2,Batman,['sega genesis'  'youtube'],archoneddzs15,Sega Mega Drive - Batman Title: Batman / „Éê„ÉÉ„Éà„Éû„É≥  Developer/Publisher: Sunsoft  Release date: 27 July 1990  Catalogue No.: T-15043  Genre: Platform Action  My mother loved this game when it was first released in 1990 (the year my brother was born) so when I saw it the other day I thought I‚Äôd pick it up. I love the small little box it comes in too. In fact I think all Sunsoft Mega Drive games in Japan came in these little boxes such as their conversion of the Sega classic dubbed Super Fantasy Zone. After playing Batman earlier on today I realized that this game has aged quite a bit. The music is still pretty cool with its excellent deep bass tracks and funky tunes. Sadly the game‚Äôs looks are now looking a bit worse for wear.   Of all the Batman games that were released in 1989-1990 Sunsoft‚Äôs version for the Mega Drive holds true to the film which was rare for movie-based games of the time (which usually took incredible ‚Äúartistic liberties‚Äù with the plot). The gameplay remains interesting due to the cutscenes and sharp graphics and the vehicle levels break up any potential monotony to be found in the game. While not an enduring classic it‚Äôs definitely worth a look for Batman fans and a solid game in its own right. Don‚Äôt be put off by the fact the game shipped on a 4 Megabit cartridge. But overall it‚Äôs still a classic game that should be in any Mega Drive collector‚Äôs collection.  Below you can see a scan of the actual game cartridge (top front and back) and instruction book.,2024-07-14 09:44:12 GMT

Like even other super cities like metropolis or central city or wherever else are at least KINDA normal. Like yea u have superman or wonderwoman or the flash but they dont really have to deal with the same level of bs as Gotham.   That being said here are a list of things that I think are extremely normal to Gotham and other things that happen in thay horrible little city:  &lt;!-- more --&gt; ‚Ä¢ the episode of Hot Ones with Brucie Wayne where no one thinks he‚Äôll even be able to stand the 2nd or 3rd wing but he eats all of them with no reaction and Sean Evans (or the in universe equivalent) just sits there like ‚Äúwow no one has ever had literally no reaction before this is really crazy and Bruce Wayne of all people?‚Äù Afterwards Bruce has second thoughts and realizes that maybe he should have played up his reaction to the spice a bit more. People Inside of Gotham are a little shocked because everytime he eats in public it is the most boring bland flavorless food imaginable. (he handled the spice so well because Batman is ready for all potential threats and forms of torture. Ridiculous levels of spice included)     ‚Ä¢ Gotham schools offer courses in self defense. In some school districts its actually mandatory thats usually in old gotham or downtown gotham. In more affluent areas self defense is still taught in schools but most kids are sent to some ritzy trainer to make sure they can defend themselves.     ‚Ä¢ No one even blinks when theres a new vigilante by the time Damian comes around. Theres still a little buzz but by the time Duke shows up people are like ‚ÄúOh cool another one. HEY BRO WHATS YOUR NAME.‚Äù I saw someone post here about how when the Wayne kids get mad at Bruce they go to Selina and make public appearances as Stray Catwomans sidekick. I personally believe that Tim was the first one to do it but Dick does it the most and gothamites didnt even need to get used to Stray showing up sometimes nor did people really care that Stray was always wildly different heights shapes colors etc. the additude is kinda like ‚ÄúI have taxes and job security to worry about. If a new vigilante is what were doing then so be it.‚Äù     ‚Ä¢ People tend to think that Gothamites aren‚Äôt smart but that city is home to the Richest smartest most creative people alive. They mostly just lack morals. Like Dr. Freeze Harley Quinn hell even The Riddler are all insanely intelligent. Half of Gothams Villains have at minimum 2 Doctorates in something or other. Gotham generates a lot of cash as a whole and small businesses thrive there. They have high employment rates and most citizens have their associates despite everything happening around them. People who have never been to Gotham before expect to have to talk down to the citizens but Gothamites just kinda roll their eyes at them and carry on about their merriment.     ‚Ä¢ Gothamites CONSTANTLY says ‚Äúbecause I‚Äôm Batman‚Äù when they don‚Äôt want to explain themselves. Kids hear it a lot from parents and they also get ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt go to sleep Condiment Man i gonna come and cover you in stinky relish.‚Äù Because truly what else is condiment man good for.     ‚Ä¢ Gothamites who work at BatBurger and typically work the night shift are used to visits from Batman Robin Red Hood Cat Woman Harley Quinn etc. Sometimes they remember the workers and ask about their family and how life is and other things like that. Theres some barely 18 y/o who just graduated high school who worls at Bat Burger and asked Red Hood to help him impress his gf by saying theyre friends. He like fuck it why not and tells the gf that the kid helped him save an old lady‚Äôs cat in a tree and now theyre bffs. She totally believes it. Score.     ‚Ä¢ I see the Gotham thinks Batman is Bruce Wayne‚Äôs boyfriend theories and raise you: Its pretty common knowledge that Bruce Wayne is Batman just no one has the heart to tell him. Also theyre scared he will quit if anyone brings it up. So from this Gothamites created the joke that BW and batman are dating and when asked about it in an interview dick grayson is like ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶yes! My adoptive father is dating the guy who dressed up like a bat every night‚Ä¶!‚Äù      ‚Ä¢ this cuased and arguement between Bruce and Dick because no! Bruce isnt dating Batman! (stray was seen again that week) HE IS BATMAN! But fuck now the public thinks theyre a couple so now bruce gets asked about it and hes like ‚Äúhaha yes my spooky bat bf is who i love very dearly!‚Äù As punishment He makes Dick bring him flowers in the batsuit because ‚Äúas far as he is concerned this is his shithead son‚Äôs fault.‚Äù Thats a direct quote btw. Little does he know this somehow ties back to Tim Drake before they met.,2024-07-14 09:43:07 GMT
0,Batman,['im sleepy but instead im writing this'],jennguyen-draws,purely vibes. i want a game like gotham knights but that has the rest of the batkids and no major overarching plot (or a bit of an overarching plot just to keeps things moving). it‚Äôs just them going on patrols investigating cases interacting with each and going on missions.  Tim‚Äôs path would have him do things at Wayne Enterprise and mini quests like ‚ÄúFind 5 pieces of blackmail to oust one particular Board member.‚Äù Damian‚Äôs would have ‚Äúlocate the mother of the stray kittens.‚Äù Jason‚Äôs could be ‚Äúgo around and check up on the kids in Crime Alley.‚Äù Cass has a dance mini game like in FF7R.

2,Batman,['sega genesis'  'youtube'],archoneddzs15,Sega Mega Drive - Batman Title: Batman / „Éê„ÉÉ„Éà„Éû„É≥  Developer/Publisher: Sunsoft  Release date: 27 July 1990  Catalogue No.: T-15043  Genre: Platform Action  My mother loved this game when it was first released in 1990 (the year my brother was born) so when I saw it the other day I thought I‚Äôd pick it up. I love the small little box it comes in too. In fact I think all Sunsoft Mega Drive games in Japan came in these little boxes such as their conversion of the Sega classic dubbed Super Fantasy Zone. After playing Batman earlier on today I realized that this game has aged quite a bit. The music is still pretty cool with its excellent deep bass tracks and funky tunes. Sadly the game‚Äôs looks are now looking a bit worse for wear.   Of all the Batman games that were released in 1989-1990 Sunsoft‚Äôs version for the Mega Drive holds true to the film which was rare for movie-based games of the time (which usually took incredible ‚Äúartistic liberties‚Äù with the plot). The gameplay remains interesting due to the cutscenes and sharp graphics and the vehicle levels break up any potential monotony to be found in the game. While not an enduring classic it‚Äôs definitely worth a look for Batman fans and a solid game in its own right. Don‚Äôt be put off by the fact the game shipped on a 4 Megabit cartridge. But overall it‚Äôs still a classic game that should be in any Mega Drive collector‚Äôs collection.  Below you can see a scan of the actual game cartridge (top front and back) and instruction book.,2024-07-14 09:44:12 GMT

Like even other super cities like metropolis or central city or wherever else are at least KINDA normal. Like yea u have superman or wonderwoman or the flash but they dont really have to deal with the same level of bs as Gotham.   That being said here are a list of things that I think are extremely normal to Gotham and other things that happen in thay horrible little city:  &lt;!-- more --&gt; ‚Ä¢ the episode of Hot Ones with Brucie Wayne where no one thinks he‚Äôll even be able to stand the 2nd or 3rd wing but he eats all of them with no reaction and Sean Evans (or the in universe equivalent) just sits there like ‚Äúwow no one has ever had literally no reaction before this is really crazy and Bruce Wayne of all people?‚Äù Afterwards Bruce has second thoughts and realizes that maybe he should have played up his reaction to the spice a bit more. People Inside of Gotham are a little shocked because everytime he eats in public it is the most boring bland flavorless food imaginable. (he handled the spice so well because Batman is ready for all potential threats and forms of torture. Ridiculous levels of spice included)     ‚Ä¢ Gotham schools offer courses in self defense. In some school districts its actually mandatory thats usually in old gotham or downtown gotham. In more affluent areas self defense is still taught in schools but most kids are sent to some ritzy trainer to make sure they can defend themselves.     ‚Ä¢ No one even blinks when theres a new vigilante by the time Damian comes around. Theres still a little buzz but by the time Duke shows up people are like ‚ÄúOh cool another one. HEY BRO WHATS YOUR NAME.‚Äù I saw someone post here about how when the Wayne kids get mad at Bruce they go to Selina and make public appearances as Stray Catwomans sidekick. I personally believe that Tim was the first one to do it but Dick does it the most and gothamites didnt even need to get used to Stray showing up sometimes nor did people really care that Stray was always wildly different heights shapes colors etc. the additude is kinda like ‚ÄúI have taxes and job security to worry about. If a new vigilante is what were doing then so be it.‚Äù     ‚Ä¢ People tend to think that Gothamites aren‚Äôt smart but that city is home to the Richest smartest most creative people alive. They mostly just lack morals. Like Dr. Freeze Harley Quinn hell even The Riddler are all insanely intelligent. Half of Gothams Villains have at minimum 2 Doctorates in something or other. Gotham generates a lot of cash as a whole and small businesses thrive there. They have high employment rates and most citizens have their associates despite everything happening around them. People who have never been to Gotham before expect to have to talk down to the citizens but Gothamites just kinda roll their eyes at them and carry on about their merriment.     ‚Ä¢ Gothamites CONSTANTLY says ‚Äúbecause I‚Äôm Batman‚Äù when they don‚Äôt want to explain themselves. Kids hear it a lot from parents and they also get ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt go to sleep Condiment Man i gonna come and cover you in stinky relish.‚Äù Because truly what else is condiment man good for.     ‚Ä¢ Gothamites who work at BatBurger and typically work the night shift are used to visits from Batman Robin Red Hood Cat Woman Harley Quinn etc. Sometimes they remember the workers and ask about their family and how life is and other things like that. Theres some barely 18 y/o who just graduated high school who worls at Bat Burger and asked Red Hood to help him impress his gf by saying theyre friends. He like fuck it why not and tells the gf that the kid helped him save an old lady‚Äôs cat in a tree and now theyre bffs. She totally believes it. Score.     ‚Ä¢ I see the Gotham thinks Batman is Bruce Wayne‚Äôs boyfriend theories and raise you: Its pretty common knowledge that Bruce Wayne is Batman just no one has the heart to tell him. Also theyre scared he will quit if anyone brings it up. So from this Gothamites created the joke that BW and batman are dating and when asked about it in an interview dick grayson is like ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶yes! My adoptive father is dating the guy who dressed up like a bat every night‚Ä¶!‚Äù      ‚Ä¢ this cuased and arguement between Bruce and Dick because no! Bruce isnt dating Batman! (stray was seen again that week) HE IS BATMAN! But fuck now the public thinks theyre a couple so now bruce gets asked about it and hes like ‚Äúhaha yes my spooky bat bf is who i love very dearly!‚Äù As punishment He makes Dick bring him flowers in the batsuit because ‚Äúas far as he is concerned this is his shithead son‚Äôs fault.‚Äù Thats a direct quote btw. Little does he know this somehow ties back to Tim Drake before they met.,2024-07-14 09:43:07 GMT
0,Batman,['im sleepy but instead im writing this'],jennguyen-draws,purely vibes. i want a game like gotham knights but that has the rest of the batkids and no major overarching plot (or a bit of an overarching plot just to keeps things moving). it‚Äôs just them going on patrols investigating cases interacting with each and going on missions.  Tim‚Äôs path would have him do things at Wayne Enterprise and mini quests like ‚ÄúFind 5 pieces of blackmail to oust one particular Board member.‚Äù Damian‚Äôs would have ‚Äúlocate the mother of the stray kittens.‚Äù Jason‚Äôs could be ‚Äúgo around and check up on the kids in Crime Alley.‚Äù Cass has a dance mini game like in FF7R. Dick would have one were he has to do tricks like the quadruple somersault or 100 push ups while balancing on his hands because one of the other batkids (probably Jason) tells him he‚Äôs losing his touch and getting old or something like that.   like any job board in rpg games you will have a list of missions on the Batcomputer where you get to select what case/mission to do and who gets to do it. You then get to play it with that character.  More ambitiously some cases have to be solved by multiple characters. You cannot progress until other characters manage to do their parts. Other model would be that the case are locked to certain character or characters but sometimes they can team up. In which case you get to be the lead party member with the others following you as support (like in Dragon Age!)  When you select a major case you get a short cutscene with Bruce summarizing it for you and handing you the file and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm counting on you. Good luck.‚Äù   Additionally we can‚Äôt have a game without a relationship building mechanic right????? So you get to do stuff with other characters and unlock cutscenes with them with special conversations ala Fire Emblem Three Houses or Persona 5!  The Gotham Knight‚Äôs email system was really cool so that stays but can also be expanded to text messages or group chats. So while you‚Äôre walking around doing whatever you‚Äôre doing you will get texts from your friend group. Like Tim would have Kon Cassie and Bart text him silly things; Jason would have Roy texting him about Lian or Kori sending him encouraging messages; Cass would have Steph messaging her at odd hours etc.  There is a whole training/tutorial sequence when you get to train with Bruce but with character specific weapons and abilities.

( she was once heard calling Penguin her uncle ? )      $ : the old black ladies LOVEEEE gotham to death. every time they see her they always lecture her in a joking way. almost as if she is their own.   ‚Äúnow i seen you in that dress at that concert last week i bet not catch you in nothing like that no mo!!‚Äù   ‚Äúyou doing good in school now?‚Äù   ‚Äúyou better not be letting them boys go backstage with you nie!‚Äù         $ - Gotham city is always in some type of danger or crime and as funny as it seems so is Lady gotham.   - Everytime lady gotham is at an event or store anywhere something INSANE always happens. ( last week lady gotham walked into a coffee shop as soon as she step foot inside the power went out üíÄ and when she stepped back out it came back on immediately. - the last time she was invited to a wanye gala it got blown up and the gotham people went crazy when they found out lady gotham was there )   - Regulars in gotham soon collectively decided that wherever lady gotham goes trouble would follow. and worked their way around it ( whenever lady gotham wants to order something from a local restaurant they meet her AT the door so she doesn‚Äôt physically go inside the restaurant and give her the food AT the door to avoid the restaurant being flooded  lost of power  or wrecked - all three has happened at once before when lady gotham is around )      $- Lady gotham is known for her sass. she has the face of a deer innocent but yet has the mouth of a demon. but then again that‚Äôs normal for the people in gotham. it‚Äôs basically new york but 20 times worse. regulars in gotham think its the funniest thing in the world. they clip the moments she‚Äôs sassy in interviews or to paparazzi and make collaborations of it on youtube or tiktok ( they go viral every time ) ÔøºÔøº     $ - Lady Gotham meets the prince when he is Robin. Robin was chasing down a villain in her apartment complex and broke through her window while trying to catch said villain. and she was PISSED. she ended up tracking Robin down and cursed him TF out. they argued with each other for that next hour. ( will make a separate story about this )         $ - Lady gothams songs are songs that the gotham people can relate to or songs that she feels like Gotham would sing if the city ever had a mouth. ( i could do a separate story about this as well ) i feel like she would sing songs that relate to death how it feel to mourn someone. given with all the crime rate in gotham at least 4 families out of 5 know that feeling of death and mourning. She would speak to them and how sorry she is that she has caused it.      $ - in interviews they would ask her who her favourite hero is. Lady gotham will give two responses. one for the character she plays ( Gotham in the human body ) and for herself ( gotham which just so happens to be her actual name )   ‚ÄúLady gotham would say Batman he has and still is one of our biggest protectors. she will always have a special place for him in her heart. because he is healing her.‚Äù   ‚Äúbut me teenage gotham i would say red hood. i love him like actually.‚Äù,2024-07-14 11:57:36 GMT

He is a billionaire because it‚Äôs useful to the plot but he is not a billionaire like our billionaires. Don‚Äôt make him say or do shits billionaires do he is not like that.  I just have enough of the posts and fics where people makes Bruce pro-capitalist a finance bro with nfts or against leftist ideas like free housing because ‚Äúthe economy üò≠üò≠‚Äù. That‚Äôs not him at all and y&#x27;all are showing that you only saw the Lego Batman movie.  First Bruce pays his taxes and hates that other rich don‚Äôt. It is shown in Future State: Dark Detective where he literally says that rich people who don‚Äôt contribute to making society better kind of deserve to be killed by a vigilante. Murder is still bad but he will not cry them AT ALL.  Second Bruce hates how people abuse the housing markets rising the prices kicking out poor people you know the drill. This is shown in Batman: White Knight when Bruce PUNCHES his rich FRIEND at a gala after learning that the guy is buying properties in Crime Alley kicks the poor people out and build new apartments complexes with rent way too high for the old residents. In Gotham Knights (the comics) he tests Lucius by playing the normal rich asshole and being like ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt take money from the shareholders these hard working folks to help the poor‚Äù because he wants to see if it will make Lucius angry. Once it does he is like ‚Äúgood you should be‚Äù and tell him he will sign it. Not being mad at the inequalities in the world is not acceptable for Bruce.  Thirdly Batman: The Animated Series often establishes how the real vilains are not the rogues but rich people. Bruce doesn‚Äôt disagree with Poison Ivy or Mr Freeze but with their methods. Bruce doesn‚Äôt hate his rogues because he knows they were pushed to a corner but he hates the rich in charge. The owner of a company is shown to be a bad guy because he doesn‚Äôt think his workers deserve to have a say in the company. Seriously if BTAS was made today we would be submerged with tweets and videos from people crying that they made Batman a communist.  Fourthly while we are at it with BTAS Bruce cares about the environment. I have seen this terrible panel of Bruce as Batman being mad that Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn destroyed a WE factory who was heavily polluting which is ooc. In BTAS Bruce is shown threatening to fire WE higher-ups because they made a partnership with a company hurting the environment. This partnership is why Poison Ivy targets him in the episode and tries to kill him btw which shows once again that they agree on the matter it‚Äôs the murder the problem. Outside of BTAS must I remind everyone that Bruce was going to marry Talia Al Ghul and that Ra‚Äôs Al Ghul saw a heir in him??? Like he has to be a bit of an ecologist for ECO-TERRORISTS to love him this much. Also Alfred said to Dick when he joined their household that Alfred wants ecological issues to be taken care of. No way would Bruce not has been raised to care about the environment or would harm the planet knowing Alfred doesn‚Äôt like it.  Finally WE has multiple charities and organizations dedicated to help people in Gotham. WE gives jobs to ex-convicts and help them in getting rehabilitate. Bruce feeds clothes and houses the poor he pays for any damage done by vigilantes or rogues. He has money to give and he gives it. AND all the galas exist so he can take money from the rich to give to the poor. He even encourages Dick in Nightwing (2016) to manipulate as much as possible his guests to milk their money. Bruce wants to take from the rich to help the poor that‚Äôs always been the case.,2024-07-14 11:01:53 GMT

2,Batman,['sega genesis'  'youtube'],archoneddzs15,Sega Mega Drive - Batman Title: Batman / „Éê„ÉÉ„Éà„Éû„É≥  Developer/Publisher: Sunsoft  Release date: 27 July 1990  Catalogue No.: T-15043  Genre: Platform Action  My mother loved this game when it was first released in 1990 (the year my brother was born) so when I saw it the other day I thought I‚Äôd pick it up. I love the small little box it comes in too. In fact I think all Sunsoft Mega Drive games in Japan came in these little boxes such as their conversion of the Sega classic dubbed Super Fantasy Zone. After playing Batman earlier on today I realized that this game has aged quite a bit. The music is still pretty cool with its excellent deep bass tracks and funky tunes. Sadly the game‚Äôs looks are now looking a bit worse for wear.   Of all the Batman games that were released in 1989-1990 Sunsoft‚Äôs version for the Mega Drive holds true to the film which was rare for movie-based games of the time (which usually took incredible ‚Äúartistic liberties‚Äù with the plot). The gameplay remains interesting due to the cutscenes and sharp graphics and the vehicle levels break up any potential monotony to be found in the game. While not an enduring classic it‚Äôs definitely worth a look for Batman fans and a solid game in its own right. Don‚Äôt be put off by the fact the game shipped on a 4 Megabit cartridge. But overall it‚Äôs still a classic game that should be in any Mega Drive collector‚Äôs collection.  Below you can see a scan of the actual game cartridge (top front and back) and instruction book.,2024-07-14 09:44:12 GMT
233,Batman,['gotham'  'in my heart of hearts i believe these things to be true and real and canon'  'bruce wayne'  'jason todd'  'red hood'  'batburger'  'brucie wayne'  'ofc vi writes too'  'dc'  'biblically accurate headcanons'  'believe me'  'source: trust me bro'  'tim drake accidentally started the batman and brucie wayne are a thing as a troll thing on reddit in his stalker era and it just kinda stuc'  'lol'],ofc-vi-writes-too,so all ive been able to think about is gotham for the past several days and more specifically how gothamite culture has to be SO drastically different and jarring to literally anywhere else in the world. Like even other super cities like metropolis or central city or wherever else are at least KINDA normal. Like yea u have superman or wonderwoman or the flash but they dont really have to deal with the same level of bs as Gotham.   That being said here are a list of things that I think are extremely normal to Gotham and other things that happen in thay horrible little city:  &lt;!-- more --&gt; ‚Ä¢ the episode of Hot Ones with Brucie Wayne where no one thinks he‚Äôll even be able to stand the 2nd or 3rd wing but he eats all of them with no reaction and Sean Evans (or the in universe equivalent) just sits there like ‚Äúwow no one has ever had literally no reaction before this is really crazy and Bruce Wayne of all people?‚Äù Afterwards Bruce has second thoughts and realizes that maybe he should have played up his reaction to the spice a bit more. People Inside of Gotham are a little shocked because everytime he eats in public it is the most boring bland flavorless food imaginable. (he handled the spice so well because Batman is ready for all potential threats and forms of torture. Ridiculous levels of spice included)     ‚Ä¢ Gotham schools offer courses in self defense. In some school districts its actually mandatory thats usually in old gotham or downtown gotham. In more affluent areas self defense is still taught in schools but most kids are sent to some ritzy trainer to make sure they can defend themselves.     ‚Ä¢ No one even blinks when theres a new vigilante by the time Damian comes around. Theres still a little buzz but by the time Duke shows up people are like ‚ÄúOh cool another one. HEY BRO WHATS YOUR NAME.‚Äù I saw someone post here about how when the Wayne kids get mad at Bruce they go to Selina and make public appearances as Stray Catwomans sidekick. I personally believe that Tim was the first one to do it but Dick does it the most and gothamites didnt even need to get used to Stray showing up sometimes nor did people really care that Stray was always wildly different heights shapes colors etc. the additude is kinda like ‚ÄúI have taxes and job security to worry about. If a new vigilante is what were doing then so be it.‚Äù     ‚Ä¢ People tend to think that Gothamites aren‚Äôt smart but that city is home to the Richest smartest most creative people alive. They mostly just lack morals. Like Dr. Freeze Harley Quinn hell even The Riddler are all insanely intelligent. Half of Gothams Villains have at minimum 2 Doctorates in something or other. Gotham generates a lot of cash as a whole and small businesses thrive there. They have high employment rates and most citizens have their associates despite everything happening around them. People who have never been to Gotham before expect to have to talk down to the citizens but Gothamites just kinda roll their eyes at them and carry on about their merriment.     ‚Ä¢ Gothamites CONSTANTLY says ‚Äúbecause I‚Äôm Batman‚Äù when they don‚Äôt want to explain themselves. Kids hear it a lot from parents and they also get ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt go to sleep Condiment Man i gonna come and cover you in stinky relish.‚Äù Because truly what else is condiment man good for.     ‚Ä¢ Gothamites who work at BatBurger and typically work the night shift are used to visits from Batman Robin Red Hood Cat Woman Harley Quinn etc. Sometimes they remember the workers and ask about their family and how life is and other things like that. Theres some barely 18 y/o who just graduated high school who worls at Bat Burger and asked Red Hood to help him impress his gf by saying theyre friends. He like fuck it why not and tells the gf that the kid helped him save an old lady‚Äôs cat in a tree and now theyre bffs. She totally believes it. Score.     ‚Ä¢ I see the Gotham thinks Batman is Bruce Wayne‚Äôs boyfriend theories and raise you: Its pretty common knowledge that Bruce Wayne is Batman just no one has the heart to tell him. Also theyre scared he will quit if anyone brings it up. So from this Gothamites created the joke that BW and batman are dating and when asked about it in an interview dick grayson is like ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶yes! My adoptive father is dating the guy who dressed up like a bat every night‚Ä¶!‚Äù      ‚Ä¢ this cuased and arguement between Bruce and Dick because no! Bruce isnt dating Batman! (stray was seen again that week) HE IS BATMAN! But fuck now the public thinks theyre a couple so now bruce gets asked about it and hes like ‚Äúhaha yes my spooky bat bf is who i love very dearly!‚Äù As punishment He makes Dick bring him flowers in the batsuit because ‚Äúas far as he is concerned this is his shithead son‚Äôs fault.‚Äù Thats a direct quote btw. Little does he know this somehow ties back to Tim Drake before they met.,2024-07-14 09:43:07 GMT
0,Batman,['im sleepy but instead im writing this'],jennguyen-draws,purely vibes. i want a game like gotham knights but that has the rest of the batkids and no major overarching plot (or a bit of an overarching plot just to keeps things moving). it‚Äôs just them going on patrols investigating cases interacting with each and going on missions.  Tim‚Äôs path would have him do things at Wayne Enterprise and mini quests like ‚ÄúFind 5 pieces of blackmail to oust one particular Board member.‚Äù Damian‚Äôs would have ‚Äúlocate the mother of the stray kittens.‚Äù Jason‚Äôs could be ‚Äúgo around and check up on the kids in Crime Alley.‚Äù Cass has a dance mini game like in FF7R. Dick would have one were he has to do tricks like the quadruple somersault or 100 push ups while balancing on his hands because one of the other batkids (probably Jason) tells him he‚Äôs losing his touch and getting old or something like that.   like any job board in rpg games you will have a list of missions on the Batcomputer where you get to select what case/mission to do and who gets to do it. You then get to play it with that character.  More ambitiously some cases have to be solved by multiple characters. You cannot progress until other characters manage to do their parts. Other model would be that the case are locked to certain character or characters but sometimes they can team up. In which case you get to be the lead party member with the others following you as support (like in Dragon Age!)  When you select a major case you get a short cutscene with Bruce summarizing it for you and handing you the file and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm counting on you. Good luck.‚Äù   Additionally we can‚Äôt have a game without a relationship building mechanic right????? So you get to do stuff with other characters and unlock cutscenes with them with special conversations ala Fire Emblem Three Houses or Persona 5!  The Gotham Knight‚Äôs email system was really cool so that stays but can also be expanded to text messages or group chats. So while you‚Äôre walking around doing whatever you‚Äôre doing you will get texts from your friend group. Like Tim would have Kon Cassie and Bart text him silly things; Jason would have Roy texting him about Lian or Kori sending him encouraging messages; Cass would have Steph messaging her at odd hours etc.  There is a whole training/tutorial sequence when you get to train with Bruce but with character specific weapons and abilities.  This is basically a mash up of my favorite things from DA FF7R P5 Yakuza series,2024-07-14 09:27:30 GMT

Like to him is not a matter of learning how to cook he‚Äôs a chemist measuring his exact nutritional needs in a cup. It‚Äôs disgusting and he shouldn‚Äôt be allowed near the blender. Barbara Gordon: not the best not the worst. She has cooked she will cook again. She‚Äôs also not trying to make anything too fancy. She prefers take out mainly because she has (and will again in the future) burnt her food to a crisp because she got distracted with oracle stuff. A quick check while the potatoes are in the oven is a very dangerous thing. Dick Grayson: he would love to be that guy that takes Instagramable pictures of his food. Sometimes he manages to do just that but that‚Äôs not sustainable for him. He has a few fancy recipes he likes to bring out to impress people or to feel like a responsible adult. Most of the time he‚Äôs sauteing random vegetables with some rice and chicken and calling it a day. It‚Äôs good healthy and filling but is not much in the great scheme of things. I feel like he‚Äôd make really good salads too for some reason. Cassandra Cain: she‚Äôs not very good at being people. Cooking is part of that a survival skill and not much more. She really appreciates nice food but doesn‚Äôt see the point in learning herself when her time is better spent elsewhere. I can see her breaking into the other‚Äôs houses to join them for dinner because she forgot to make her own. Jason Todd: this man cooks. I don‚Äôt care if the whole ‚ÄúAlfred‚Äôs favorite‚Äù thing is a bit fanon it‚Äôs fun fanon. I think that since he is aware of how they lie to Alfred sometimes he‚Äôd be an even better cook. He‚Äôs the kind of guy to make any recipe work first try even if he keeps workshopping it until it‚Äôs perfect. He‚Äôs also very neat and cleans after himself. Cooking helps him wind down after a hard night. If he messes up though he might cry. Stephanie Brown: she took the whole ‚Äúcooking is like science‚Äù and decided to be a mad scientist. Her cooking works for her because she has crazy tastes. Like she‚Äôd make a salami and Nutella sandwich and consider it her Magnum opus. She loves baking too just so she can fuck around and find out. Steph usually leaves the mess there until she needs the space to cook again. Not because she‚Äôs dirty it‚Äôs just that she gets so caught up in trying the final product she forgets about it. She stresses the fuck out of Jason. Tim Drake: he‚Äôs more of an utilitarian closer to Cass. He learned a few simple recipes when he was a kid and that‚Äôs all he needs. Through the years he‚Äôs had to add a couple more to make it more balanced and fit his needs (first with the increase of physical activity and then the asplenia). He has a very healthy but very limited diet. He refuses to add anything else because there‚Äôs no need. He already knows how to cook the things he needs and likes well thank u very much. Duke Thomas: this man can cook. It takes him a while to get into it but he has great instinct for it. He‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúvibes only‚Äù kind of cook which makes him an awful baker but Alfred has the sweets covered anyways. Part of his process includes picking the spices from the back of the rack that Alfred pretends don‚Äôt exist. He‚Äôs creative but not in as much of a messy way as Steph. And unlike her he does have functioning taste buds so sometimes he ends up a victim of his own hubris. Most times it works out for him. Damian Wayne Al Gul: he helps his siblings whenever he mooches food from them (because Alfred is the only one that tolerates idle hands in the kitchen). He loves Jason‚Äôs cooking but he has more fun with Duke and Steph. They allow his input and suggestions which makes him feel like he‚Äôs contributing. He prefers Duke though because his success rate is higher.,2024-07-14 12:10:09 GMT

( she was once heard calling Penguin her uncle ? )      $ : the old black ladies LOVEEEE gotham to death. every time they see her they always lecture her in a joking way. almost as if she is their own.   ‚Äúnow i seen you in that dress at that concert last week i bet not catch you in nothing like that no mo!!‚Äù   ‚Äúyou doing good in school now?‚Äù   ‚Äúyou better not be letting them boys go backstage with you nie!‚Äù         $ - Gotham city is always in some type of danger or crime and as funny as it seems so is Lady gotham.   - Everytime lady gotham is at an event or store anywhere something INSANE always happens. ( last week lady gotham walked into a coffee shop as soon as she step foot inside the power went out üíÄ and when she stepped back out it came back on immediately. - the last time she was invited to a wanye gala it got blown up and the gotham people went crazy when they found out lady gotham was there )   - Regulars in gotham soon collectively decided that wherever lady gotham goes trouble would follow. and worked their way around it ( whenever lady gotham wants to order something from a local restaurant they meet her AT the door so she doesn‚Äôt physically go inside the restaurant and give her the food AT the door to avoid the restaurant being flooded  lost of power  or wrecked - all three has happened at once before when lady gotham is around )      $- Lady gotham is known for her sass. she has the face of a deer innocent but yet has the mouth of a demon. but then again that‚Äôs normal for the people in gotham. it‚Äôs basically new york but 20 times worse. regulars in gotham think its the funniest thing in the world. they clip the moments she‚Äôs sassy in interviews or to paparazzi and make collaborations of it on youtube or tiktok ( they go viral every time ) ÔøºÔøº     $ - Lady Gotham meets the prince when he is Robin. Robin was chasing down a villain in her apartment complex and broke through her window while trying to catch said villain. and she was PISSED. she ended up tracking Robin down and cursed him TF out. they argued with each other for that next hour. ( will make a separate story about this )         $ - Lady gothams songs are songs that the gotham people can relate to or songs that she feels like Gotham would sing if the city ever had a mouth. ( i could do a separate story about this as well ) i feel like she would sing songs that relate to death how it feel to mourn someone. given with all the crime rate in gotham at least 4 families out of 5 know that feeling of death and mourning. She would speak to them and how sorry she is that she has caused it.      $ - in interviews they would ask her who her favourite hero is. Lady gotham will give two responses. one for the character she plays ( Gotham in the human body ) and for herself ( gotham which just so happens to be her actual name )   ‚ÄúLady gotham would say Batman he has and still is one of our biggest protectors. she will always have a special place for him in her heart. because he is healing her.‚Äù   ‚Äúbut me teenage gotham i would say red hood. i love him like actually.‚Äù,2024-07-14 11:57:36 GMT

He is a billionaire because it‚Äôs useful to the plot but he is not a billionaire like our billionaires. Don‚Äôt make him say or do shits billionaires do he is not like that.  I just have enough of the posts and fics where people makes Bruce pro-capitalist a finance bro with nfts or against leftist ideas like free housing because ‚Äúthe economy üò≠üò≠‚Äù. That‚Äôs not him at all and y&#x27;all are showing that you only saw the Lego Batman movie.  First Bruce pays his taxes and hates that other rich don‚Äôt. It is shown in Future State: Dark Detective where he literally says that rich people who don‚Äôt contribute to making society better kind of deserve to be killed by a vigilante. Murder is still bad but he will not cry them AT ALL.  Second Bruce hates how people abuse the housing markets rising the prices kicking out poor people you know the drill. This is shown in Batman: White Knight when Bruce PUNCHES his rich FRIEND at a gala after learning that the guy is buying properties in Crime Alley kicks the poor people out and build new apartments complexes with rent way too high for the old residents. In Gotham Knights (the comics) he tests Lucius by playing the normal rich asshole and being like ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt take money from the shareholders these hard working folks to help the poor‚Äù because he wants to see if it will make Lucius angry. Once it does he is like ‚Äúgood you should be‚Äù and tell him he will sign it. Not being mad at the inequalities in the world is not acceptable for Bruce.  Thirdly Batman: The Animated Series often establishes how the real vilains are not the rogues but rich people. Bruce doesn‚Äôt disagree with Poison Ivy or Mr Freeze but with their methods. Bruce doesn‚Äôt hate his rogues because he knows they were pushed to a corner but he hates the rich in charge. The owner of a company is shown to be a bad guy because he doesn‚Äôt think his workers deserve to have a say in the company. Seriously if BTAS was made today we would be submerged with tweets and videos from people crying that they made Batman a communist.  Fourthly while we are at it with BTAS Bruce cares about the environment. I have seen this terrible panel of Bruce as Batman being mad that Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn destroyed a WE factory who was heavily polluting which is ooc. In BTAS Bruce is shown threatening to fire WE higher-ups because they made a partnership with a company hurting the environment. This partnership is why Poison Ivy targets him in the episode and tries to kill him btw which shows once again that they agree on the matter it‚Äôs the murder the problem. Outside of BTAS must I remind everyone that Bruce was going to marry Talia Al Ghul and that Ra‚Äôs Al Ghul saw a heir in him??? Like he has to be a bit of an ecologist for ECO-TERRORISTS to love him this much. Also Alfred said to Dick when he joined their household that Alfred wants ecological issues to be taken care of. No way would Bruce not has been raised to care about the environment or would harm the planet knowing Alfred doesn‚Äôt like it.  Finally WE has multiple charities and organizations dedicated to help people in Gotham. WE gives jobs to ex-convicts and help them in getting rehabilitate. Bruce feeds clothes and houses the poor he pays for any damage done by vigilantes or rogues. He has money to give and he gives it. AND all the galas exist so he can take money from the rich to give to the poor. He even encourages Dick in Nightwing (2016) to manipulate as much as possible his guests to milk their money. Bruce wants to take from the rich to help the poor that‚Äôs always been the case.,2024-07-14 11:01:53 GMT

I feel like he‚Äôd make really good salads too for some reason. Cassandra Cain: she‚Äôs not very good at being people. Cooking is part of that a survival skill and not much more. She really appreciates nice food but doesn‚Äôt see the point in learning herself when her time is better spent elsewhere. I can see her breaking into the other‚Äôs houses to join them for dinner because she forgot to make her own. Jason Todd: this man cooks. I don‚Äôt care if the whole ‚ÄúAlfred‚Äôs favorite‚Äù thing is a bit fanon it‚Äôs fun fanon. I think that since he is aware of how they lie to Alfred sometimes he‚Äôd be an even better cook. He‚Äôs the kind of guy to make any recipe work first try even if he keeps workshopping it until it‚Äôs perfect. He‚Äôs also very neat and cleans after himself. Cooking helps him wind down after a hard night. If he messes up though he might cry. Stephanie Brown: she took the whole ‚Äúcooking is like science‚Äù and decided to be a mad scientist. Her cooking works for her because she has crazy tastes. Like she‚Äôd make a salami and Nutella sandwich and consider it her Magnum opus. She loves baking too just so she can fuck around and find out. Steph usually leaves the mess there until she needs the space to cook again. Not because she‚Äôs dirty it‚Äôs just that she gets so caught up in trying the final product she forgets about it. She stresses the fuck out of Jason. Tim Drake: he‚Äôs more of an utilitarian closer to Cass. He learned a few simple recipes when he was a kid and that‚Äôs all he needs. Through the years he‚Äôs had to add a couple more to make it more balanced and fit his needs (first with the increase of physical activity and then the asplenia). He has a very healthy but very limited diet. He refuses to add anything else because there‚Äôs no need. He already knows how to cook the things he needs and likes well thank u very much. Duke Thomas: this man can cook. It takes him a while to get into it but he has great instinct for it. He‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúvibes only‚Äù kind of cook which makes him an awful baker but Alfred has the sweets covered anyways. Part of his process includes picking the spices from the back of the rack that Alfred pretends don‚Äôt exist. He‚Äôs creative but not in as much of a messy way as Steph. And unlike her he does have functioning taste buds so sometimes he ends up a victim of his own hubris. Most times it works out for him. Damian Wayne Al Gul: he helps his siblings whenever he mooches food from them (because Alfred is the only one that tolerates idle hands in the kitchen). He loves Jason‚Äôs cooking but he has more fun with Duke and Steph. They allow his input and suggestions which makes him feel like he‚Äôs contributing. He prefers Duke though because his success rate is higher.,2024-07-14 12:10:09 GMT

It was all Bruce‚Äôs fault. He knew that people grieve differently but desecrating Jason‚Äôs grave was a step too far. The manor doors opened to reveal an exhausted Alfred. His heart went out to his poor grandfather who was given the unenviable task of caring for his absolute nutcase of a dad.  ‚ÄúMaster Dick I am well aware that the situation is dire please spare Master Bruce from the worst of your wrath he does not know what he is doing.‚Äù Alfred pleaded the tiredness showing in his voice. Giving Alfred a pitying glance he managed to get out ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see what I can do Al.‚Äù and continued his March down to the cave.  Downstairs everything was dark save for the examination table which illuminated an unrecognizable casket. He still knew whose it was though. Resentment burned through him as he remembered how he wasn‚Äôt even informed of Jason‚Äôs passing until he stepped back onto earth from an offplanet mission. He didn‚Äôt even get to see Jason one last time after he passed. The fight afterwards wasn‚Äôt fun to remember either. Then there was the Joker the way he gloated about how hard he hit Jason the way every fiber in his body acted on instinct the need for Joker to be nothing more than a bloody splotch on the ground. He took a deep breath he had work to do.  Pushing aside his stormy thoughts he made his way next to his mentor his father and a man who had at this moment completely lost it. ‚ÄúBruce-‚Äù Dick started only to be cut off by the man himself with a single word ‚ÄúLook.‚Äù The casket was empty. There wasn‚Äôt a body to be found. ‚ÄúI did- did you take him out?‚Äù Dick sputtered out as his heart began to race and his finely honed detective instincts began to kick in.  There were scratch marks and bloodstains on the inside of the coffin one of the hinges was broken it all indicated someone clawing their way out. Dick knew that Bruce was deeply flawed but there was not a snowflake‚Äôs chance in hell that he would bury his son while he was still alive.  But the only option left was ridiculous Jason would have had to have woken up alive and dug his way up to the surface and left of his own volition. But then again it wouldn‚Äôt explain why his grave seemed undisturbed for so long and if Jason really is alive where is he now? Jason was a notable figure in Gotham high society it would be unlikely for the press to stay silent if they found the adopted Wayne boy who was thought to have died wandering around the streets in ragged clothes. No there was something more going on here.  Dick glances at Bruce the confusion in his face must have been apparent as Bruce states a single name and that clears nearly everything up; ‚ÄúTalia.‚Äù  It was the only answer that made sense. The Al Ghuls were some of the only people in the world who he knew for a fact that could bring people back from the dead with their Lazarus Pit. They may also be the only people on the planet capable of covering up a crime scene so well that it could evade even Batman‚Äôs skills.  In spite of the dark scene in front of him Dick couldn‚Äôt help but feel almost giddy at the thought of his baby brother still being alive. A long dead hope resurrected in him. Jason might still be alive.  He heard Bruce‚Äôs voice next to him ‚ÄúOnce the test results on the bloodstains come back we head for Nanda Parbat.‚Äù  Back In Nanda Parbat:  Jason paced around his room reminiscing about the fiasco that had been their last meeting. He was fully prepared for Tim to decline his invitation but much to his surprise and relief he had accepted. He supposed that he could take this as evidence that he didn‚Äôt fuck up too badly.  His plan was simple: sit the kid down and explain to him that while he had nothing against him he wouldn‚Äôt be returning to Bruce or Robin anytime soon. Being Batsy‚Äôs sidekick was fun at first but as time went on he started to see the cracks in logic. He wasn‚Äôt sure if he had grown out of Robin or if dying finally made him lose the rose tinted glasses.  He grew up in Crime Alley the most rundown and dangerous part of Gotham he knew of many people who would have benefited greatly from a second chance a tiny bit of grace from the world. But there were also those who were so far gone that it made little sense to keep them around at the expense of everyone else. He didn‚Äôt think that all criminals deserve the death penalty and even if they did it shouldn‚Äôt be decided by the Feds. But he can decide. He‚Äôs died he‚Äôs grown up among criminals he may not be the smartest kid around but he knows how to read people.  He can live with being a killer even if Bruce couldn‚Äôt.  Jason ran his fingers through his hair a faint knock on the door broke him out of his reverie.  It must be Tim no one else he knew knocked like that. The lower ranked assassins never wanted to enter his room unless they had to Damian and Cass wouldn‚Äôt bother knocking and Talia would knock once to let Jason know of her presence before letting herself in.  He rushed to the door ‚ÄúTim Come in.‚Äù he said slightly breathless he hoped it wouldn‚Äôt show too much.  The kid looked genuinely confused yet hopeful ‚ÄúYou called for me?‚Äù ‚ÄúUh yeah we need to discuss some things about Bruce Robin and some other stuff.‚Äù he winced that didn‚Äôt seem remotely friendly more like a business meeting.  Tim‚Äôs heart sank ‚Äôso it was just about Robin.‚Äô He chided himself for holding out hope that Jason wanted to genuinely get along with him. ‚ÄôJason probably wants me to quit Robin but I don‚Äôt know if I can do that. What if he doesn‚Äôt agree with me and gets mad? What would Talia think? How would I get back to Bruce?-‚Äô He was rudely brought back down to earth as the door slammed open revealing two diminutive figures one in dark green and the other clad in black.  The smaller of the two ‚ÄòWas that a child??‚Äô had a fierce frown on his face ‚ÄúTodd why have you not come to our training sessions in the past few days?‚Äù He eyed Tim suspiciously as if he were the one intruding on their time. The second figure a petite young girl looked over curiously and gave him a wave. Good to see that at least one of them was friendly.  The smaller one stepped forward giving him a withering side eye ‚ÄúTodd who is this.‚Äù He looked about ready to bring out his wakizashi as Jason promptly shielded Tim. ‚ÄúDamian calm down he is a guest of our mother Tim Drake the current Robin.‚Äù the small child who was now known as ‚ÄòDamian‚Äù loosened the grip on his sword. He still gave Tim a severe side eye but the thought of displeasing his mother put a damper on his stabby plans.  As Tim turned he could see the black figure next to Jason despite swearing that he saw her next to Damian mere moments ago. She nudged Jason who seemed to have a moment of realization. ‚ÄúUh yeah and this is Cassandra you can call her Cass don‚Äôt expect to reply though since she‚Äôs mute. You learn to understand her signs the more you get to know her.‚Äù The girl now dubbed Cassandra gave him a smile and a thumbs up which Tim took to mean that he was making a good impression.  ‚ÄúHi Cassandra hi Damian.‚Äù Tim could feel the stress melting away from him it almost seemed like he was introducing himself to a new class rather than whatever he was actually doing.,2024-07-14 15:00:55 GMT

So like first I played exclusively as Red Hood cause my plan is to play as each character all the way through and then go back and play it a 5th time were I interchange  Also I played on PS so it might be different to when you play on PC but here are my thoughts     &lt;!-- more --&gt;   1. The controls? Whack. There‚Äôs no actual jump button you hold X when you‚Äôre near a ledge to climb or vault but there‚Äôs no actual designated jump button   (I learned the hard way if you run and hit crouch you slide‚Ä¶ I had to restart a mission cause I slid in when I was supposed to not get caught and immediately got caught‚Ä¶)  2. The first Mr Freeze boss fight is stupid and I hate it. I never finished the Mr Freeze story because I just could not get past that stupid fucking boss fight. His health is too high he has too many fucking lazer types there‚Äôs no cover after round one it‚Äôs dumb I hate it fuck whoever designed it I hope you pillow is always warm and your bananas are always rotten!  3. A lot of the time you have to stay undetected but it‚Äôs hard if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. So like when you first have to break into GCPD you just have to fucking book it while crouching for the door otherwise you will get caught. Didn‚Äôt know that the first time hid for ages and got caught. It‚Äôs also really hard to tell if you run a certain way if you‚Äôll be seen or not. Inside the GCPD bull pen I alerted all the guards to yellow cause I tried to run for the fence and vault but again vaulting in this game SUCKS     The combat is like‚Ä¶ fine I guess? I‚Äôm dyspraxic as fuck so I‚Äôve always struggled with like button mashing and shit like that but sometimes you‚Äôre fighting someone and it‚Äôs like impossible. The bog standard talons were harder to fight than the upgraded with knives or the big brute dudes cause you cannot hit them you have to shoot and it‚Äôs awkward trying to get the angle to line up especially if there‚Äôs like 4 of them.      Also the final fight with Talia right at the end she dodges waaay too much and you cannot hit her it‚Äôs so annoying.      It was a good game I enjoyed myself I will be replaying it at least four times (currently started my Nightwing play through) but also‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs issues that really should have been considered. I had to google how to do levels and seen others complaining so it‚Äôs not just a me thing but yeah‚Ä¶ also I love Jason‚Äôs build in the game but he looks a little old (he genuinely looks older than Bruce in some scenes) and man needs hair. Just give my boy a mop of black with white hair PLEASE,2024-07-14 16:57:58 GMT

In UtRH Jason menages to kidnap him unflichingly listening to whatever he said. He had him at a bullet point and there was no fear. Joker was just a tool for his confrontation with Bruce. The same is in the lost days. Jason doesn‚Äôt kill Joker not because he feared him but because he‚Äôs a drama queen.   Joker has nothing on Jason that he can fear. Whatever Joker can do to him it was already done. Jason met the worst end; he got murdered by him. There‚Äôs nothing worse that Joker can do to him (at least in Jason‚Äôs mind).  Jason‚Äôs fear isn‚Äôt the Joker. Maybe in the beginning when he first woke up but with time his loa training Joker is nothing. What Jason fears is betrayal being left alone. Dying. But not Joker.,2024-07-14 18:25:03 GMT
