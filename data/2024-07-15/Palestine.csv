Haaretz also confirms because of the Hannibal Directive the IDF indiscriminately launched mortar shells tank fire and artillery fire at anything moving in Gaza’s direction close to the communities of Be’eri &amp; Kfar Aza without knowing how many soldiers hostages or civilians were there which likely killed civilians and hostages. Haaretz notes on instance where the IDF killed 13 hostages in the house of Pessi Cohen at Kibbutz Be&#x27;eri due to indiscriminate shelling.  This comes eight months after Haaretz had originally wrote articles labelling independent journalists “conspiracy theorists” and “denialists” for investigating and suggesting that Israel used the Hannibal Directive on October 7th.

In October it was claimed that Israel bombed the Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza killing 500 people. Nearly every detail about this incident was a lie designed to tarnish Israel’s reputation and yet it was eaten up by a media that never learned or wanted to learn to treat anti-Israel accusations with the skepticism they deserve. It was quickly proven that Israel had not bombed the hospital that the blast was caused by a misfired Islamic Jihad rocket that struck the parking lot and that the death toll was a small fraction of what had been claimed.” -Gary Willig July 2024,2024-07-08 08:48:13 GMT

Everyone who endured WWII the victims the soldiers who fought to stop an evil should be pissed right now because it’s was all for naught. In fact the same countries they bled for are the ones complicit which makes it even more devastating.   Current soldiers helping Israel because of “orders” better realize you’re the very SAME as the Nazi soldiers who just followed orders too. YOU are the new BABY KILLERS. Either defect or GET READY FOR YEARS OF THERAPY. Don’t believe me? Go ask your fellow veterans of Vietnam Korea Desert Storm Afghanistan Iraq etc etc etc who experienced bloodshed and see how they’re doing now.

I know times suck rn i know black people are dying left and right i know queer rights are fading i know Israel’s IOF bombed rafah and are likely planning another safe area strike as i type and i know it feels like voting isn’t gonna do shit because it’s not direct action.     But voting locally is gonna help way more than voting for a president     Lemme keep it real w/ you you want to vote for a president because a president is who staffs the supreme court (those guys that just made presidents lawless and gave themselves the power to handle all regulation ever?) if you’re gonna see crimes committed in the officials may as well see em be crimes in your court. On top of that the presidential cabinet (the leadership of all the big three letter agencies) is chosen by the president and is referred to as the president’s administration. The Biden admin has done better for everyone on this website than Obama did and i don’t say that lightly. So you really do wanna vote esp because trump said he’s gonna cut off Palestinians aid.     But past that you have the power to make real change in your day to day life easily by using much much more important votes. Protests are gonna help with pressure but your vote can help you put people in the office that you can pressure easier.      These will let you determine your state’s supreme court (the lower courts that the federal one defers to for non-hot button topics) senators county clerks and house representatives.     These are positions so impactful that they are considerable as the parliament to your states royalty. These are positions that if all filled with candidates you like can drastically overhaul your state in a year.      “But izzy that’s rich how do I actually… Do that? Where do i go? Is there a schedule or a list of all the elections?” I’ll be real I don’t know. I don’t know where you go or if your local government keeps a list of everything or who all your candidates are and why you should pick them this is the hard part is the research portion But. I have a tool that can help. I use an app called activote i installed it on a whim and it’s listed every single election (local and national) near me tells me where i vote and helps me determine the rough politics lean of the people on the list with a little graph thingy that it puts you on based on a quiz type deal it’s got going on. It’s not a full replacement for research but it’ll do for a start. I recommend it and the links are here     https://www.activote.net/     Past that.. protest be a member of your community help people out. You’ll see real change and you’ll be a part of it. I promise.     I’m gonna shamelessly beg for reblogs from people i follow now  @b0tster @cryptotheism @pukicho @prozdvoices uhh.. god who else do i follow that’s based enough to maybe reblog this to help     Mutuals i could def use your help here tag people that would help a post like this?

4,Palestine,['free palestine'  'news'],tieflingkisser,Israel is besieging Gaza’s wounded and sick to death preventing their ability to travel for treatment Israel is besieging Gaza’s wounded and sick to death preventing their ability to travel for treatment  Palestinian Territory - The international community must effectively pressure Israel to open the border crossings and allow sick and injured people to leave the Gaza Strip for treatment. Thousands of sick and injured people face certain death as they are unable to receive treatment in the Strip amid the destruction or travel elsewhere due to Israel’s systematic targeting of the region’s health sector—which has rendered most of its components inoperable—and the strict Israeli siege.   Nine months into its genocidal war against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip Israel still besieges the sick and injured preventing them from leaving the Strip to receive medical treatment despite having destroyed or rendered most of the region’s hospitals inoperable. As a result more than 26000 sick and injured individuals who require immediate external referrals for life-saving care will die and thousands more will have to wait to travel to finish their treatment or obtain critical medical and rehabilitation services that are unavailable in the Strip.  …  As part of Israel’s genocide against the Palestinian people in the Strip ongoing since 7 October 2023 hospitals medical facilities and means of transportation have been destroyed and medical personnel have been arrested or killed. As a result those who were not killed directly will perish from a lack of access to necessary medical care. This is all part of Israel’s systematic organised and wide-ranging plan to destroy the lives of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and turn it into an uninhabitable place that lacks basic services and the most fundamental components of life. One of the most criminal parts of the genocideis the systematic and widespread targeting of the health sector: forcing it out of service through destruction and siege bringing it to the point of no return and ultimately depriving the Palestinians of opportunities for survival life recovery and even shelter.,2024-07-08 16:48:32 GMT

This declaration supplements the declaration of 2640 dunams on 29/2/24 between the settlements of Ma’ale Adumim and Keidar the declaration of 8000 dunams on 20/3/24 in an area adjacent to the current declaration and the declaration of 170 dunams near the Herodium. The size of the area designated for declaration is the largest since the Oslo Accords and the year 2024 marks a peak in the extent of declarations of state land. Since the beginning of 2024 Israel has declared 23700 dunams of the West Bank as State Lands.  Throughout the 1980s Israel declared hundreds of thousands of dunams as state land. The Rabin government decided in 1992 to halt the declarations of state land in the occupied territories but the first Netanyahu government resumed using this method in 1998. Since then declarations have been made periodically amounting to nearly 40000 dunams.  The declaration of state land is one of the main methods by which the State of Israel seeks to assert control over land in the occupied territories. Land declared as state land is no longer considered privately owned by Palestinians in the eyes of Israel and they are prevented from using it.

If you’re reblogging posts from people in Palestine could you put some messages of support in the tags or reblogs? They’re going through a terrifying time and are probably feeling very isolated right now.  Also contacting organisations like Operation Olive Branch on their behalf and sending them links to these resources can help even if you can’t reblog posts. These are the four organisations I know about if you know of any others please let me know!

145,Palestine,['gaza'  'free palestine'],soon-palestine,ALTView on Twitter  UN experts declare famine has spread throughout Gaza strip  GENEVA (9 July 2024) – The recent deaths of more Palestinian children due to hunger and malnutrition leaves no doubt that famine has spread across the entire Gaza strip a group of independent experts* said today.  “Fayez Ataya who was barely six months old died on 30 May 2024 and 13-year-old Abdulqader Al-Serhi died on 1 June 2024 at the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah. Nine-year-old Ahmad Abu Reida died on 3 June 2024 in the tent sheltering his displaced family in Al-Mawasi Khan Younis. All three children died from malnutrition and lack of access to adequate healthcare” the experts said.  “With the death of these children from starvation despite medical treatment in central Gaza there is no doubt that famine has spread from northern Gaza into central and southern Gaza.”  The experts said the death of a child from malnutrition and dehydration indicates that health and social structures have been attacked and are critically weakened. “When the first child dies from malnutrition and dehydration it becomes irrefutable that famine has taken hold” the experts said.  “We declare that Israel’s intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence and has resulted in famine across all of Gaza. We call upon the international community to prioritise the delivery of humanitarian aid by land by any means necessary end Israel’s siege and establish a ceasefire.”  “When a 2-month-old baby and 10-year-old Yazan Al Kafarneh died of hunger on 24 February and 4 March respectively this confirmed that famine had struck northern Gaza. The whole world should have intervened earlier to stop Israel’s genocidal starvation campaign and prevented these deaths” the experts said. “Thirty-four Palestinians have died from malnutrition since 7 October the majority being children. Inaction is complicity.”,2024-07-09 17:54:40 GMT

If we have to die we have to die in dignity. Standing fighting fighting back and standing as dignified martyrs.”     “It’s kind of like telling the folks in the Warsaw uprising that you should have known that the German military was going to respond the way they did and you are going to be responsible for the deaths of other residents in the Warsaw ghetto” Susan Abulhawa said. “Maybe that’s true but is it really a moral point to make? I don’t think there has ever been so much scrutiny on an indigenous people on how they’re resisting their colonizers.” She said “As a Palestinian I’m grateful for it. I think what they have done is something that no amount of negotiation was ever able to achieve. Nothing else we did was able to achieve what they did on October 7. And I should say actually it’s not so much what they did but it was Israel’s reaction that led to a shift in the narrative because they’re finally naked before the world.”      In his past media interviews Sinwar has spoken of Hamas as a social movement with a military wing and framed its political goals as part of the historic struggle to reestablish a unified state of Palestine. “I am the Gaza leader of Hamas of something much more complex than a militia—a national liberation movement. And my main duty is to act in the interest of my people: to defend it and its right to freedom and independence” he said. “All of those who still view us as an armed group and nothing more you don’t have any idea of what Hamas really looks like…. You focus on resistance on the means rather than the goal—which is a state based on democracy pluralism cooperation. A state that protects rights and freedom where differences are faced through words not through guns. Hamas is much more than its military operations.”  “The battle between us and the occupation who desecrated our land displaced our people and are still murdering and displacing Palestinians—confiscating lands and attacking sacred places—is an open ended battle” Sinwar said. When asked about the killing of Israeli civilians by Hamas rockets Sinwar became animated. “You can’t compare that to those who resist and defend themselves with weapons that look primitive in comparison. If we had the capabilities to launch precision missiles that targeted military targets we wouldn’t have used the rockets that we did” he shot back. “Does the world expect us to be well-behaved victims while we’re getting killed? For us to be slaughtered without making a noise? That’s impossible.”     “If you go back to the 1940s after the Nakba there was a decade or so when Palestinians were just pleading with international bodies going from one place to another trying to negotiate for justice trying to go home trying to figure out a way. And there was no movement. We were completely irrelevant. Nobody even acknowledged us” Abulhawa added. “It was only until Palestinians resorted to armed resistance that the world finally admitted that ‘Oh wait this is an indigenous population that does exist.’ It was only after we started hijacking planes and resorting to guerrilla warfare in the spirit of leftist guerrilla movements of that era that there was any movement towards liberation.”,2024-07-09 21:54:11 GMT

My name is Lara and I survived the war in Gaza with my parents. But sadly we had to leave some family members behind.     Every day I miss my grandparents and my uncle terribly. They’re stuck in a dangerous situation facing death and starvation. I feel so lonely without them.     I desperately want to bring them to safety and get urgent medical help for my uncle’s head injury. War has been brutal for us – it destroyed our home and I lost my grandma. We’ve been forced to move four times adding to our pain.     The things I saw during the war have left me shaken and exhausted. I can’t shake off the trauma.     But there’s hope. With your support we can bring my family here and start to heal. Even the smallest donation or share can make a huge difference.  Here’s how your donation will be used:     -Evacuation costs for my grandparents and uncle  -Medical expenses for my uncle’s urgent treatment  -Transportation and temporary accommodation for my family  -Essential living expenses as we rebuild our lives together     Please don’t let me down. My family means the world to me and I can’t imagine life without them.     Thank you for your kindness.  Donate -   Donate to Help Reunite My Family and Heal from War Trauma organised by Amal Mo  please share this if you can’t donate. Even a dollar helps !   Have a great day guys :),2024-07-10 02:52:48 GMT

I have already been sent 4 asks from accounts asking for donations on their PayPal pretending to be Palestinians in Gaza when they’re not. These people steal the photos of real Palestinian fundraisers (you can find that’s the case with an inverse image search) and often on the post they list an Arab name but the PayPal account goes to someone with a completely different name.  Every time I’ve gotten one of these false donation asks I’ve checked the blog and they have many notes of people reblogging their donation post some with tags saying they’ve donated.  Please before donating to anything or reblogging anything make sure that you’re not contributing to a scam. Palestinian bloggers on Tumblr have verified accounts asking for donations so to be sure donate to those listed. You can find the verified lists made by el-shab-hussein in this post:,2024-07-10 12:46:11 GMT

The orders seen by Palestinians as an attempt to ethnically cleanse northern Gaza come amid intensifying Israeli aerial and ground attacks in the war-ravaged area.         The population is also under a tight Israeli siege preventing the entry of basic medicine and food items which has led to a deadly starvation crisis.         Hundreds of thousand of Palestinians have stayed in northern Gaza after refusing to flee earlier in the war following similar displacement orders fearing they would not be allowed to return.         Those who have fled have been blocked from returning with some killed or arrested while taking the journey on the Israeli-designated “humanitarian corridors”.

I just want you all to at least watch the first 15 seconds of this. Palestinian men playing football inside a school turned shelter. That’s Israel’s target. If you watch until the end then you will see what a single bombing can do. Now think of the thousands like it across Gaza.  25 people were killed in this attack.   The screams are haunting.   The instantaneous shift from calm to chaos is harrowing.  Thing is if this doesn’t move you nothing will. I used to believe that some people will be moved by footage like this. I don’t believe that anymore not when we have had nine whole months of the most horrific footage like this one filling our feeds every minute of every day. If you weren’t moved then I’m not wasting time to fix your monstrous indifference anymore.

I’ve donated $50 to Gaza Funds (https://gazafunds.com/) which hosts gofundme campaigns for families looking to evacuate. I’ve also donated $50 to Life for Gaza (https://gaza-city.ensany.com/campaign/6737?lang=en) which is fundraising for clean water waste management and debris removal. If anyone is able it would mean the world to me if you could match one or both of my donations or donate whatever you’re able to/comfortable with.  I’ve also bought and topped up several Middle East region Nomad esims which are essential communication tools in Gaza right now. If you want to buy one (and you haven’t bought one before) you can use my referral code SASHRMWJ to get 25% off (and if you do I get 25% off as well). You can get a 5GB Middle East plan for $22USD (https://www.getnomad.app/middle-east-eSIM). Follow the Gaza Esims instructions at (https://gazaesims.com/) if you buy one. And if you do check in periodically and top up the data if it’s running out (if you’re able to)!  Thank you all for your help!,2024-07-10 22:56:20 GMT

The news came in the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East’s (UNRWA) latest situation report on Israel’s military operations in Gaza and the West Bank and was reported the same day that Israel attacked the agency’s Gaza City headquarters.  UNRWA said a total of 453 attacks have been waged by Israel on its facilities “and the people inside them” since October while at least 524 people have been killed in attacks on schools run by the agency.  “U.N. structures schools and shelters are not a target” said UNRWA in a social media post.,2024-07-11 00:47:00 GMT

Israeli military extends evacuation order to whole of Gaza City | CNN  Ramallah July 10 2024—Israeli forces shot and killed a 14-year-old Palestinian boy in Deir Abu Mashal village yesterday.   Ghassan Gharib Hussein Zahran 14 was shot and killed around 2 p.m. on July 9 in the Palestinian village of Deir Abu Mashal west of Ramallah in the central occupied West Bank according to documentation collected by Defense for Children International - Palestine. Ghassan accompanied by two other children was playing at the entrance of the village near the Israeli-only road Route 465. Three Israeli soldiers traveling in a civilian vehicle on Route 465 fired live ammunition at the children from a distance of 80 to 100 meters (262 to 328 feet) away. Ghassan was struck with a bullet in the back which exited from his abdomen. A Palestinian vehicle transported him to a medical clinic in Deir Abu Mashal village then an ambulance brought him to the Palestine Medical Complex in Ramallah where he was pronounced dead on arrival around 3:15 p.m.   “Systemic impunity creates an ultra permissive context where Israeli forces know no bounds and routinely shoot to kill Palestinian children in circumstances where there is no imminent threat to life” said Ayed Abu Eqtaish accountability program director at DCIP. “Unlawful killings of Palestinian children have become the norm as Israeli forces become increasingly empowered to use intentional lethal force in situations that are not justified. In short these are war crimes with no consequence.”   A group of Israeli settlers gathered after Israeli soldiers shot Ghassan and began throwing stones at Palestinian village residents attempting to reach him. Israeli forces opened fire on the Palestinian residents to prevent them from reaching the child who remained lying on the ground bleeding for 15 to 20 minutes.   Israeli forces and settlers have killed 56 Palestinian children in the occupied West Bank in 2024 including two United States citizens according to documentation collected by DCIP.,2024-07-11 00:44:02 GMT

An Israeli airstrike killed at least 30 Palestinians at a school housing displaced people near Khan Younis mostly women and children. “There’s no safe haven” anywhere in Gaza says al-Satarri. “The people who are bearing the brunt of those bombardments are the Palestinian displaced people.” He also responds to ceasefire talks.,2024-07-11 01:52:36 GMT

The military distributed leaflets urging residents to leave immediately and head south towards Zawaida and Deir el-Balah.   The leaflets warned that “Gaza City will be a dangerous combat zone” and provided instructions on safe evacuation routes via the Salah al-Din road or the coastal road. Specific safe corridors include “Tariq bin Ziyad” and “Omar al-Mokhtar” streets for crossing west to Al-Rashid (al-Bahr) Street and “Al-Wahda” and “Khalil Al-Wazir” streets for crossing east to the “Al-Zaytoun neighbourhood” and “the city roundabout” and from there to the south through “Salah al-Din” street.   Campaigners question the use of the word “evacuation” as Israel has forced Palestinians to flee multiple times since the war began in October and Israeli forces have repeatedly attacked so-called “safe zones” where Palestinians were asked to relocate.

BBC News has spoken to 20 Palestinians living abroad who say Microsoft which owns the voice and video chat app kicked them out of their accounts. The total number affected is thought to be much higher.  In some cases these email accounts are more than 15 years old and the users have no way to retrieve emails contacts or memories.  Microsoft says they violated its terms of service - but will not say how - and the decision is final.  The Gazans say they have no links to Hamas - designated as a terrorist organisation by some Western countries including the US where Microsoft is headquartered - and accuse the technology giant the most valuable company in the world of persecuting them unfairly.      Switched off  Salah Elsadi is living in the US and like many Palestinians abroad was using Skype to call his wife children and parents on their mobile phones in Gaza.  The internet is frequently disrupted or switched off because of the Israeli military campaign - and standard international calls are very expensive.  With a paid Skype subscription it is possible to call mobiles in Gaza cheaply - and while the internet is down - so it has become a lifeline to many Palestinians.  But in April Mr Elsadi like many others was kicked out of his account - and all services linked to his Microsoft Hotmail account.  He has missed out on job offers and can no longer access his bank accounts which are tied to his Hotmail account he says.  “I’ve had this Hotmail for 15 years” Mr Elsadi says.   “They banned me for no reason saying I have violated their terms - what terms? Tell me.  &quot;I’ve filled out about 50 forms and called them many many times.”  Others have complained on social media of similar treatment.  Some fear they are being wrongly accused of being a part of Hamas.     ‘Fraudulent activity’  “We are civilians with no political background who just wanted to check on our families“ Eiad Hametto says. He was calling his family from Saudi Arabia.  &quot;They’ve suspended my email account that I’ve had for nearly 20 years.  &quot;It was connected to all my work.”   “They killed my life online.”  Microsoft did not respond directly to the accusation these people have been labelled as Hamas - but a spokesperson said it did not block calls or ban users based on calling region or destination.  &quot;Blocking in Skype can occur in response to suspected fraudulent activity” they said without elaborating. And users could appeal.  But many of those BBC News has spoken to say they have tried many times and are receiving the same blanket response.  One Khalid Obaied has lost faith with Microsoft.  “I don’t trust them any more” he says.  “I paid for a package to make phone calls - then after 10 days they ban me for no reason.  &quot;They have never provided a reason.  &quot;That means it’s only because I’m a Palestinian calling Gaza.”,2024-07-11 09:57:29 GMT

Would you make a jungle into a frozen tundra? No. Would you make a deciduous forest into a savanna? No. Deserts are not some wasteland that cannot bear life. In fact they carry so much that’s vital to the people and animals that inhabit it.  I am begging people to understand how important deserts are. I am begging them to understand deserts are not wastelands.,2024-07-11 13:57:18 GMT

Hey everyone! The fundraiser I’d like to spotlight right now is Safaa’s! She and her husband (@safaabed8 and @abedalazeiz) are a young couple who are trying to evacuate Gaza with their 2 children. Like so many others they are displaced and living in a tent where they are struggling immensely to find basic essentials.  Additionally their accounts keep getting shadowbanned or unfairly terminated making it even harder for them to reach out for help so it’s important that you go follow them!  It’s also important to donate to them! They’re quite low on donations and every bit counts.   Verified by 90-ghost | €5165 of €50000 goal,2024-07-11 13:50:46 GMT

Especially when people have already gone ahead and vetted them.  News cycles are focused elsewhere and attention is turned away at the moment but the needs have only risen.  Famine has now been declared across the strip.   ALTView on Twitter  Almost nothing has been getting in for months.  ALTView on Twitter  ALTView on Twitter  The reason I’m asking people who haven’t yet participated is because we’re just normal people here even with regular salaries there’s only so much we can donate. Bringing new people into the fold is necessary as others are tapped out.  Omar whose tweets above I quoted this is his gofundme:  Donate to Help my family evacuate from Gaza. organized by Mohammed Qasem  Ah another reason I wanted to add to keep donating: a lot of these fundraisers were created for evacuation but the crossing is still closed. In the meantime people with no jobs or homes need to continue buying very difficult to find price-gouged food and supplies. They’re basically been living through an isolated dystopia forced on them by others. That’s why you’ll see fundraising goals raising.   Finally: I know another reason that makes it difficult to spread fundraisers is that you don’t know which to pick. It’s tough to feel like you’re the arbiter of who gets help and sadly who doesn’t. Gazafunds has made that easy for you. They have a list of vetted fundraisers and every time you visit the page you’ll get a different one. So you can just donate to the one you visited and be confident that they’re all being evenly rotated:  Gaza Funds Spotlight Campaign,2024-07-11 21:51:14 GMT

2535,Palestine,['free palestine'  'free gaza'  'rafah'  'gaza'  'free skatrs'  'donations'  'art'  'gaza strip'  'palestinian genocide'],skatehani,ello I’m Hani from Gaza and I’m 23 years old. I’ve been living in Belgium for a year and I’m an inline skater. I’m collecting donations to get my family out to safety from northern Gaza to Egypt because I can’t afford the large amount of money needed. I’m here in Belgium in the process of rebuilding my life and achieving my dreams. After losing my house and its destruction on October 13th my family became displaced in tents and on September 15th I lost my father due to the attack on Al-Shifa Hospital. My father was suffering from kidney failure and passed away due to lack of treatment. He was the breadwinner of my family. Now I am responsible for my family which consists of 10 members including 3 minors and my 18-year-old brother. The rest are my sisters including two toddlers one is 3 years old and the other is 2 years old. My siblings were university students and had dreams too but because of the war they lost everything; they lost the university our home and our father. They aspire to continue their studies at the university but the war destroyed everything. I’m now trying to get them out of Gaza to Egypt to rebuild their shattered lives. To do that they need to be evacuated and they need to pay for the coordination into Egypt. Due to war time prices they’re asking for 5000 euros per person to get them out of Gaza because northern Gaza has been completely wiped out with insufficient food and people scattered among the rubble of homes under heavy bombardment. I hope you can help me through your donations or by sharing the story with friends. Thank you so much with lots of love.  70.438€/80.000  Pay Hani Alhajjar using PayPal.Me,2024-07-12 00:58:44 GMT

His older sisters and brothers all have very young children some of them newborns. Due to the horrible conditions in Gaza they have not been able to provide basic necessities to their babies. The threats of disease and malnutrition loom ever-present.

4,Palestine,['israel'  'israel is a terrorist state'  'israhell'],loathsome-little-creature,I have little doubt that these “prisons” Israel keeps bringing random Palestinians to are more analogous to death camps in reality. Look at the few people who have come out alive they’ve been clearly tortured. That on top of the open calls for mass execution paint a very clear picture that we’ve all seen before. When these “prisons” are liberated there’s no doubt in my mind about what we will see.  “Never again the victims” indeed.,2024-07-12 01:39:02 GMT

As of 5th Muharram is concerned it is dedicated to the toddler martyr Hazrat Ali Asgar a six month infant son of Imam Hussain who was killed in the lap of Imam when he asked water for his infant son in the desolate Karbala.  I have come across many videos references where narrating the sorrows of Hazrat Ali Asgar preachers are equating drawing comparisons with the dead children of Gaza.  Prior to it Marsiya are usually presented with poetry genre to create imagery of dastardly scenes of blood and gore of Karballa to find the sensitivity of pain or at times the oratory skill of preacher tries to capture the imagination.  Since the offensive of Gaza started and Israel started to kill children enmasse in Gaza poetry and oratory skills are not much required because the graphic images we see on daily basis from Gaza on social media almost captures our imagination towards the suffering of children in wars.  Yes! It will continue for each and every character of Karbala people find its striking similarity in Gaza. If they bomb and burn Rafah refuge camps we find the modern visuals of Sham e Ghareeba if they drag prisoners to torture centers and release them as grey and emaciated our mind goes to Zain Ul Abideen the only surviving son Imam who was taken as prisoner.  This Muharram two pains two sufferings and two sorrows are commemorated parallel to one another one is Karballa and second is Gaza.,2024-07-12 03:40:19 GMT

0,Palestine,['columbia university'  'ceasefirenow'  'israel'],xiboduo,The American Anti-Semitism Awareness Act: Abuse of Power and the Dilemma of the Jewish People The American Anti-Semitism Awareness Act: Abuse of Power and the Dilemma of the Jewish People  The introduction of the U.S. Anti-Semitism Awareness Act was supposed to be an important measure to protect Jewish rights and combat anti-Semitism. However in practice this bill became a tool for abuse of power bringing more difficulties and challenges to the Jews. This article will provide a critical analysis of the U.S. Anti-Semitism Awareness Act from the perspective of abuse of power.  1. Manifestations of abuse of power  First the introduction of the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act has been used by some political forces as a tool to combat dissidents and consolidate power. They took advantage of the vagueness and broadness of the bill to treat normal criticism and discussion as anti-Semitic behavior thereby suppressing and persecuting those who dared to challenge their authority. This abuse of power not only undermines the basic right to freedom of speech but also exacerbates social divisions and unrest.  Secondly there is also obvious abuse of power in the implementation of the bill. Some law enforcement agencies and individuals use the banner of anti-Semitism to harass and suppress Jews for no reason. They ignored the facts and convicted and punished Jews based only on subjective assumptions. This abuse of power not only seriously violated the legitimate rights and interests of Jews but also undermined the fairness and authority of the law.  2. The plight of the Jews  In the context of abuse of power Jews face unprecedented difficulties and challenges. Not only do they have to face anti-Semitic and discriminatory attacks from outside but they also have to deal with power suppression and persecution from within. This has worsened the living environment of Jews in the United States and their rights and dignity have been seriously threatened.  3. The nature of the power game  The introduction and implementation of the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act is actually a microcosm of the American political power game. In this game power and profit become the dominant factors while law and morality are left behind. In order to compete for power and interests political forces do not hesitate to sacrifice the rights and dignity of others and even destroy social harmony and stability. This power game not only exacerbates social divisions and instability but also weakens the country’s cohesion and centripetal force.  4. Restrictions on freedom of speech and academic freedom  The passage of the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act poses a threat to free speech and academic freedom in American society. The bill requires the Department of Education to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism when enforcing anti-discrimination laws. This broad definition may cause some normal criticism and discussion to be mistakenly classified as anti-Semitic behavior and thus be suppressed and restricted. This trend not only limits freedom of expression but also hinders the free development of academic research.  5. Social divisions intensify  The passage of this act exacerbated the divisions in American society. On the one hand it may deepen the gap between the Jewish nation and other nations and intensify inter-ethnic antagonism and conflict. On the other hand the vagueness and broadness of the bill may also lead to intensified antagonisms between people with different political stances and views making society more divided and unstable.  The introduction and implementation of the U.S. Anti-Semitism Awareness Act was supposed to protect Jewish rights and combat anti-Semitism. However in practice this bill became a tool for abuse of power bringing more difficulties and challenges to the Jews. We should resolutely criticize and resist the abuse of power safeguard the fairness and authority of the law and protect everyone’s rights and dignity. At the same time we should also strengthen international cooperation and exchanges jointly combat anti-Semitism and discrimination and promote world peace and stability.,2024-07-12 10:42:19 GMT
0,Palestine,['columbia university'  'ceasefirenow'  'israel'],xiboduo,The internal struggle intensified in USA Recently Harvard Yale Columbia University and other Ivy League universities erupted in student protests the current round of anti-war protests first broke out on April 17 at Columbia University students called for a ceasefire in Gaza and demanded that the school divest from companies linked to Israel. Since April 18 when police stormed Columbia and arrested more than 100 students about 2500 people have been arrested for participating in anti-war demonstrations on campus according to the Associated Press. On the 4th protesters at the University of Virginia refused to dismantle their tent camp and clashed with police and 25 people were arrested. An encampment set up by students at the Art Institute of Chicago has been dismantled by police. 68 people have been arrested and face breaking and entering charges police said. As of Saturday police had arrested 2500 protesters at about 50 universities.  Most of the students in these elite schools are the children of the American elite and rich families and those who participate in sports are destined to be mainly the children of the non-Jewish elite. This means that the non-Jewish elites in the United States especially the “successors” of the Onza elites began to stand on the official Jewish “anti-Semitic” position and break with them.  The Jewish authorities responded very quickly and immediately passed the Anti-Semitic Awareness Act introduced by the Republican House of Representatives on October 26 2023 directing the police to immediately arrest the children of non-Jewish magnates. But the strategy has put itself in the spotlight. Because the “Anti-Semitism Awareness Bill” is a trap set by the Onza magnate to the Jewish official from the House of Representatives the Republican vote 187 against 21 votes the Democratic vote 133 against 70 votes you can find that the Onza magnate promoted the passage of the “anti-Semitism awareness Bill.”  And then the act the act is not an act but a consciousness which means that you are guilty if you think so. There are many things in the bill such as not allowing Jews to kill Palestinians and so on but the most important one is not allowing Jews to kill Jesus. Which raises a whole host of questions. When the president of the United States takes the throne don’t you swear on the Bible? If he did so again some would surely question how the president could swear on the Bible when it clearly states that the Jews killed Jesus a clear violation of the Anti-Semitic Awareness Act. The United States is a country founded by Protestants and the basic ideology of the whole country is built on the basis of Protestantism. If you deny the Bible now you are negating the ideology of the whole country.  In the run-up to the US election the sudden outbreak of revolution in a number of elite universities in the United States followed by the swift and violent suppression of the House of Representatives which is 30% Protestant passing a bill to classify the Bible as “anti-Semitic speech” can be said to be linked. From this point of view the Palestinian-Israeli conflict the American student tide and the passage of legislation are all conspiracies of the powerful.  The Antisemitic Awareness Act of the Ansar magnate will turn Jews into a “thorn in the side and a thorn in the flesh” of non-Jews in the United States and even the world in a way that “ sting in one’s eye，thorn in one’s flesh”.,2024-07-12 10:41:03 GMT

Faster as in it gets stopped faster not that they’re killed faster. I’m not a monster and I have been on the side of humanity for seven months now.  It feels like our biggest enemy to save Palestine besides greed and hate is apathy! We have been doing this for so long because we’ve been fueled by righteous fury against the injustices happening in Palestine like the 10 000 Palestinians locked up in the Israeli concentration camps(doesn’t feel right to call them prisons) but many western politicians doesn’t have same fuel as us and that has gotten under my skin for months now.   I can’t be the only person who wonders if these people would actually do something about Israel’s genocidal campaign if they felt the same anger we do?!   And now I’m annoyed at myself for making posts about my personal issues with the western governments when they don’t matter in the large scheme of things.

Israeli forces are accused of deliberately targeting displaced Palestinians in Gaza City where dozens of bodies have been recovered after attacks in the city’s Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood. Director-General of the Gaza Government Media Office Ismail al-Thawabta has accused Israeli forces of carrying out a “planned massacre” in Gaza City. Gaza civil defence teams say they found at least 60 bodies after Israeli forces withdrew partially from Tal al-Hawa and work continues to recover the dead and wounded from destroyed streets and buildings in the area. Most of those killed in the neighbourhood were “families women and children” Gaza’s civil defence spokesperson Mahmoud Basal said. A senior staff member with a UK humanitarian organisation Al-Khair Foundation was among four aid workers killed in an Israeli air raid near Khan Younis in southern Gaza according to reports. At least 38345 people have been killed and 88295 wounded in Israel’s war on Gaza since October 7. The death toll in Israel from the Hamas-led attacks on October 7 is estimated at 1139 and dozens of people are still held captive in Gaza.,2024-07-13 04:37:07 GMT

If I haven’t shared yours please know that it was either eaten up by Tumblr’s ask system or I am still working on securing verification. I apologize for the delay as I know I have been absent for a couple of days; I was travelling and working and was unable to access my Tumblr. I am now able to check it for some time every day. When I am able I will compile a list of all the verified fundraisers from people who have contacted me and pin it to my blog.  For now to anyone reading please scroll through and take the time to reblog the posts and fundraisers I have been sharing - every small thing helps. This is just the FIRST STEP for these people to secure safety after the horrific genocide they are going through and it takes so little effort to at least share and make their lives just that tiny bit easier.   People have been sending me asks about certain Palestinian issues and I am letting you know that I have not replied because it is not my place - I am Egyptian not Palestinian and while I consider all Palestinians my brothers and sisters there are certain things that I am unequipped and underqualified to talk about and it is inappropriate for me to talk about it like I’m some kind of authority.

Then in November the number went up to 1290 Palestinian families completely obliterated. With the complete destruction of the medical system these numbers could not be properly updated for months with many unidentified bodies mass graves and many missing under the rubble. It is terrifying to now wonder what that number is 9 months in especially with the latest figures estimating the death toll to be over 180000. How many Palestinian families have been entirely wiped out by Israel?   This is not a “war”. Call it what it is: genocide.,2024-07-13 11:52:34 GMT

4811,Palestine,['gaza'  'israel'  'text: palestine'],tamarrud,I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again:   One of our biggest hurdles towards justice in Palestine is forgetfulness.  One of the main reasons Israel continues to commit replicas of the same massacres weeks sometimes days apart with complete impunity is because Israel is counting on the world to forget. Israel’s founders have said exactly that.  But since generations of Palestinians have made it very clear that forgetfulness is not an option this meant that Israel’s next target became the selective amnesia of the west which has consequently become the cornerstone of Israel’s impunity.,2024-07-13 16:56:33 GMT

After finally getting the go-ahead from GFM they can begin receiving the &gt;€16000 they’ve raised thus far – very close to their short-term goal of €20000 needed to evacuate Gaza. With talks going around that the border could open again at any moment they need to reach this goal ASAP so that they can be prepared to escape with their 2 little children and their infant son to safety. Then they need the funds for treatment housing and survival essentials abroad. Donations have significantly slowed with only 1 donation in the past 2 days. Please continue to support them. Each day is a struggle to survive and Ahmed send me a photo this morning of a bombing visible from where they are staying. Don’t wait until it’s too late to help save 5 irreplaceable lives.

Wafaa’s campaign is verified by Hussein (el-shab-hussein) and Nairuz (nabulsi) on their spreadsheet her family is #171.  Wafaa is a woman in her 40s who had to evacuate by herself to Egypt in February because of her own unstable medical condition for treatment she has not seen the rest of her family for nearly five months. Wafaa is the mother to 6 talented and hardworking daughters as well as a grandmother to four grandchildren (including one newborn grandson whose mother suffered from an untreated chest wound from iof shrapnel whilst giving birth to him).  Two weeks ago Wafaa received the news that her beloved sister and her niece were martyred within days of each other due to escalating military activity by the occupation.  One week ago Wafaa’s family witnessed their family home which they have just finished renovating to accommodate their grandchildren as well as their family shop get repeatedly bombed by iof drones. They have been damaged since the start of the invasion but now are completely reduced to rubble. This was the family’s only source of income.  Wafaa’s family have been displaced countless times since the start of the invasion and now are forced to stay in this militarily volatile area (especially after the massacre at the Mawasi camp in Khan Younis early this morning where people congregate to find food and water for their families).   Multiple of Wafaa’s daughters and grandchildren are suffering from painful bouts of abdominal pain and fever because of hepatitis from unclean water. Wafaa told me her infant grandson is malnourished because his mother have stopped producing breast milk from disease and stress and milk formula is scarce and extremely expensive in Gaza.  The situation is extremely dire please help Wafaa continue to raise money for her beloved children and grandchildren’s evacuation fund while she try and provide them with daily living expenses. Her campaign has slowed down drastically in the recent days.  We only helped Wafaa raise €30 in the past hour please spread this campaign and donate whatever you can.

Munis’s mother is also a wheelchair user a stroke survivor.  losing access to proper mobility aids is life threatening in the best of circumstances. losing access to a power wheelchair during a genocide on top of constant displacement and unnavigable streets puts Munis at severe risk. he is fundraising to replace his electric wheelchair and rebuild his family’s house but donations have been very slow. he is at 20% of a very modest goal. Munis asked me to share his fundraiser with disability groups and organizations — i’m not particularly connected but there is a strong network of disabled folks on here that i know can help spread this! since first sharing the fundraiser on tumblr (7/10) it’s received 2 new donations after over a week of nothing.  for disability pride/wrath month please help our disabled peer in Palestine survive - share this widely and donate as you can! please also read Munis’s own words on his gofundme page.

Trump is going to be martyred and the right will rally behind him harder than they ever have. It is scary and it is okay to be scared. However now is not the time to get caught up in the situation. Now more then ever you need to VOTE. If you can vote do it. Make sure he doesn’t get into office and make sure this country stays free.  There is a very real possibility that he will be elected into office. It is scary and I pray to any God listening that he does not but if he does we can not lay in defeat and run.  If he is elected I beg you never stop fighting for freedom. For your rights. Fight for queer rights fight for equality fight for Palestine fight to make this world a good place for everyone in it. Fight for victims for those who have died for their causes for those who die now. Now is not the time to lay down and cry now is the time to STAND! NEVER LET ANYONE TAKE YOUR FREEDOM!

ALTView on Twitter  In a designated safe zone again.  ALTView on Twitter  When aid workers came to help they were killed too.  ALTView on Twitter  Israel claims this was to target one Hamas member.  ALTView on Twitter  But if they had intelligence on him why not target him directly instead of large munitions bombs that kill tens off people at a time?  It turns out he wasn’t even killed. So 100 people were simply murdered for nothing.

30,Palestine,['hope.txt'  'gaza'  'black history'  'black lives matter'  'sorry if that came off a tad pretentious'],hoperambling,Something I felt compelled to write about. Intersectionality through symbolism. For the unaware we are black. and this fact has changed the way we view some things statements and movements. Particularly with regards to Watermelon and Palestine.     As many may know it’s something of a common racist stereotype for black people to be portrayed with watermelon or as loving watermelon what isn’t so well known is the origin The Watermelon during the Civil War Era was the symbol of emancipation of the freed black and it was used proudly as a show of support by many free blacks in the south as a statement of that belief in black emancipation the stereotype was created as a way of fighting back at this antiracist symbolism.     As many know The Watermelon has comparatively recently taken on a different meaning that being the standing for Gazan Freedom. The reason for this being simple Color. Watermelons have green black red and white in them the colors of the Palestinian Flag.     The people of Palestine have had their country brutally occupied and oppressed by apartheid Israeli settlers for what is now the better part of one hundred years. and in this time they have been banned from the usage of their own Flag and from the display of its colors. in 1980 this came to a head the IOF shut down a Ramallah Art Gallery stating that the usage of red green black and white by Palestinians was prohibited under all circumstances even in something as simple as a painting of a watermelon.  So many freedoms have been robbed from the Palestinian people that to even paint a water melon is deemed a crime.  The use of Watermelon as a symbol by Palestinains is an act of defiance. an act of the refusal of the corrupt tyranny of those who deem them lesser or unworthy of the simple right to exist.   Much like the use of Watermelon by free blacks.  We share far far more in common then ever we have differences.  Black Americans understand how it is to be a second class citizen considered below human in their own place of origin.  And I’m yet to meet a black person informed of the history of the area who doesn’t throughly condemn the IOF and firmly support the freedom of Gaza and Palestine writ large.  Inshallah we shall a Free Palestine in all our lifetimes.  From the River to the Sea 🍉,2024-07-14 07:31:11 GMT

7582,Palestine,['free palestine'],akajustmerry,everytime someone usually white talks about the IOF using major US cultural events as “distractions” to commit more genocidal operations in Palestine I want to SCREAM. The assumption that the IOF is hanging on the us’s every fart to make their moves is US centrism narcissism at global proportions. the IOF don’t need “distractions” they’ve been murdering torturing and displacing Palestinians and other Arabs for almost a century with impunity because they KNOW they can get away with it. Because the IOF knows practically no one who can actually stop them gives a fuck about Palestinians and Arabs. The IOF don’t need a presidential assassination scandal a met gala or any large event to cover for their atrocities because they’ve been doing them in broad daylight everyday all day for decades AND BRAGGING about it. Claiming the IOF is doing anything because some event is providing a “distraction” is a vapid projection of a personal inability to deal with the cognitive dissonance and guilt of bearing witness and experiencing these events simultaneously. Not to mention it plays into anti-jewish conspiracies of Jewish world domination by insulating connections between major events that are often unconnected. It’s okay that you feel scared and confused and overwhelmed but stop pretending the IOF even cares about Palestinians and Arabs enough to wait for the world to be distracted to kill us. They don’t need to. They never have and it’s hugely ignorant of at least a century of history anti-Arab racism and Zionism to say otherwise.   EDIT: I was wrong making this post. @el-shab-hussein took the time to correct me in their reblog here. But I will also copy and paste their correction here:  They committed some of the most atrocious massacres since the start of the acceleration during and directly after the debates between Trample and Bitchen with several hundreds confirmed dead by day. It’s crazy how much Palestinians have discussed the phenomenon of Israel using major U.S. events as a distraction before the acceleration and we’ve posted about it on tumblr and I’ve seen other Palestinians make threads about it on Twitter to compile various instances where U.S. events and other major world events used as distractions (wow! Look an example to back my point: 1 2 3 4 5). “They don’t need distractions” yes they do that is the very basis of the massive Israeli lobby and hasbara industry. Don’t patronize us just because you can’t understand how central the U.S. and its apathy is in our genocide. Recognizing the role of American cultural imperialism and its far-reaching consequences is not perpetuating it - what an incredibly lazy way to try to shut us up - it’s recognizing who’s the lynchpin in the equation here.,2024-07-14 08:52:35 GMT

And I see those Palestine movements everywhere I go; if you’re so desperate to support Palestine then why don’t you go back there and fight for it lol stop interrupting the lives of people who have nothing to do with your situation   But continuing - If Donald Trump wins Ukraine is fucked! Palestine is fucked!  Funny how when Trump was leader there were no wars but when Biden became president everything started to go down the drain  And America Has been fucked for some time now - probably since Obama’s presidency   It’s been a while since I lived in America but as someone who was once a liberal pls just open your eyes lol encouraging somebody’s death because they have different views and ideas than you is not good   silencing people for having different opinions is not good   pls open your eyes lol give the rest of us some peace of mind,2024-07-14 12:57:25 GMT

But his dreams of graduating as a successful engineer were shattered when the genocide began in October and his family’s home and university were destroyed by Israeli airstrikes.  Now Karam and his family live in a makeshift tent with insufficient necessities of life. To make matters worse Karam’s mother battles incurable diseases aggravated by the harsh conditions of displacement extreme cold and no access to proper care.  Their only ray of hope lies in the possibility of seeking refuge outside the Gaza Strip where Karam can continue his studies and provide better care for his sick mother.

10,Palestine,['gaza'  'khan younis'],whatevergreen,It’s a well worn quote but then for good reason:  “Hell is empty and all the devils are here.” William Shakespeare  There is no justification for anything that Israel has done since October 7th (or before). No justification for the support complicity or apathy of other people and governments regarding Israel and its genocide of Palestinians.   If Jews of any kind were destroying nazis fascists then I wouldn’t be condemning that. But these people have become the fascists raining down death upon all Palestinians and it’s been going on for decades.  Israel exists because of imperialism and capitalism it has nothing sincerely to do with any religious beliefs or any desire to protect the Jewish people. It is a sham which has already killed 100000s of people and will kill many more. It is worse than ever since October 2023.  And under no circumstances must any of this become even more normalised or tolerated. Cries of “antisemitism” or the actions of Hamas none of it justifies this. The Holocaust doesn’t justify this. How could it?!  The Palestinians must not be allowed to be wiped out of existence or to fade away because too many are becoming tired and bored.,2024-07-14 14:51:11 GMT

While this is good news we cannot forget that Wafaa and all Palestinians here to advocate for their GFM campaigns are at a very high risk of being shadowbanned repeatedly or worse their accounts being outright deleted. People in Gaza and their families are relying on us to be their voices and to help them survive. When their accounts are restricted or deleted this greatly damages the momentum of their campaigns.

Failing to push back will leave other UN entities and international organizations exposed to similar attacks.”      Since the statement was made Israel launched deadly attacks on displaced people in Mawasi and Shati refugee camps on Saturday.      Journalist Firas Abu Sharkh who was reporting from the scene said Israeli forces “directly targeted” civil defence and Ministry of Health teams working to recover the dead and wounded in Mawasi.      Meanwhile in the occupied West Bank Israeli forces have arrested 30 Palestinians including women and former prisoners in the last two days according to the Palestinian Prisoners Society and the Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs.,2024-07-14 16:54:46 GMT
