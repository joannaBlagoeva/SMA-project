Initial injuries: How did Curly end up a tetralateral amputee. Why were the amputations PERFORMED for that matter. His injuries apparently reached all four limbs in equal spots. The right eye being covered implies either that the blast was stronger on the right side (AKA that he was turned so that the blast faced the right side of his body) or that he received additional injuries (perhaps shrapnel or an injury as he was thrown backwards by the force of the blast). IF he was turned to the blast with his right side of the body, wouldn‚Äôt the injuries be more severe there? More damaged tissue, more unsalvageable tissue. If this was the case I feel like his amputations would be up to the hip/shoulder. I‚Äôve heard the idea that he was perhaps stuck in foam but that doesn‚Äôt clear anything up for me. Were his arms and legs both equally inside of the foam so that when the blast struck his joints (elbows/knees) were all injured beyond repair?  Even if that‚Äôs the case, they didn‚Äôt have the supplies for an amputation (let alone 4) by ANY means. There was no trained medical personnel on board (Anya only finished the company course) and amputation is a dangerous procedure just as any other surgery is. I feel like attempting to perform a botched amputation would be far more dangerous than leaving the tissue be. Though that poses the risk of necrosis. More on necrosis later. 

Infection, cardiovascular concerns, blood loss and thermoregulation: How did the crew stop the initial bleeding? How did they remove whatever they used to stop the initial bleeding? Blood loss had to be severe, and I feel like the crew would get to him far too late to stop him bleeding out completely. And for my second statement, things stick. Tissue paper sticks, cloth sticks, it sticks to tissue. Anything would cause further damage of the tissue. Is ALL of his skin gone? All of it burned off? Is there still patches of it in tact? Either way, he lost ANY methods of thermoregulation since most of it (that being, the skin) is gone and the crew don‚Äôt even bother to try and maybe, I don‚Äôt know, stop him from going hypothermic. Give him a blanket. None of that. He‚Äôs in a gown and some bandages. How did he not die of hypothermia? Directly tied to the lack of thermoregulation, the bleeding and the pain, how did his heart not give out from the initial shock and later on psychophysical strain? I genuinely find it so hard to believe that after all of that his heart would still be holding out. It‚Äôs a muscle that can overstrain itself just like any other. Why and how in the world did he NOT get anything infected??? Jesus Christ? As far as we‚Äôre aware he hasn‚Äôt changed that gown nor those bandages in months. There is no disinfectant on the ship and even if there was using it on him would damage tissue further. Your skin protects the tissue underneath from infection and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs easy for wounds to get infected, because they‚Äôre breaks in the skin. It should be necrotic. What the hell. Also how‚Äôs he not blind how didn‚Äôt his eye dry out he can‚Äôt blink 

The purpose of keeping him alive: torturers tending to injuries It‚Äôs clear that the crew can recognise when a mercy killing is necessary (such as shown on the example of Daisuke). So why in the WHOLE WIDE WORLD is Curly left alive? Is it punishment because they think he crashed the ship? Why give him painkillers then? Why are you easing his pain? To stop his heart from giving out, to keep him alive longer? IIRC Anya DID want to kill Curly but Jimmy was against it. This would not only completely out Jimmy as a sadist but it makes me wonder why is his word valued above the word of someone who has more medical experience than him, even if it was just a company course. Was she scared of what he‚Äôd do if she didn‚Äôt listen to him?? Also why is this not a matter the entire crew is supposed to discuss??? And this leads into my NEXT point: Why is nobody attempting to establish some sort of communication method with Curly? Hello?? He‚Äôs clearly conscious and present within the moment, able to see and process the things around him. He literally cannot do anything. The least you could do, if you truly want to ease pain, is to try to stimulate him intellectually. To talk to him like a man to a man. His humanity was stripped from him by his surroundings rather than the crash itself. Letting him stare at a white ceiling with his only stimulation being pills forced down his throat is genuinely inhumane. Nobody is asking him whether HE wants to live or to die. Nobody is taking into consideration that he still has thoughts. Perhaps I‚Äôm taking the entirety of his character too literally. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love this game. I haven‚Äôt played it myself, I could only bring myself to watch analysis videos, so some of the things I say might be straight up wrong, and I‚Äôm willing to take any criticism and discussion that starts. This was just me nerding out about medicine", True, 2024-10-27 22:58:43 GMT

This had to stop. He was going to just hurt more and more people. There will be more victims. You can‚Äôt become a victim, you can‚Äôt have the ones you love be under his hands. No. No one deserved this. 

<!-- more --> No one except him. 

Curly was at deaths door, Anya is going to reach a point of no return in her pregnancy, Daisuke is on the edge of a mental break down, and even Swansea is shattering apart. One bottle of mouthwash at a time. 

You didn‚Äôt know what will happen next. You were crashed in god knows where, but maybe there is a chance of hope. Maybe there is a way to get home. Maybe. Maybe maybe maybe. 

The cockpit is full of foam, but who says you can‚Äôt just cut away at it enough to access a transmitter? What‚Äôs else is left to do? Not like waiting and praying is helping. 

Would explain why Jimmy refused to let anyone have the keys to the pit. 

He didn‚Äôt want his sins to escape. 

You‚Äôll make them escape out of his damn body. 

There was no way Anya was going to tell you where the gun was. Guess that means you‚Äôll need to improvise. Had a ax. A ax can do it, but getting it away from Swansea is going to be troubling. He was keeping it as much for self defense at this point as you would have to. 

You needed a weapon. 

Your hands couldn‚Äôt handle it. Jimmy was able to do so much harm already. Anya was most likely not his only victim. He‚Äôs certainly done this before. Meaning he knows how to fight, and get someone pinned under him. There to do whatever he wanted. 

You had to get him before he got you. 

What else could be a weapon?

A knife? A knife! 

You ran into the kitchen, much to the confusion of Swansea and Daisuke, only to start tearing the drawers out. Utensils flying everywhere as you tried to find something. Anything sharp. 

To your horror there was no knives. 

‚ÄúHe took all the knives‚Ä¶.‚Äù

You looked over, same for Swansea, as it had been Daisuke who said it. 

Daisuke said it. 

‚ÄúThey are all in Curly‚Äôs old room. Since he‚Äôs the new captain now he has the ability to lock down that door. No one gets in, and no one gets out. Whatever he wants to hide is there. Noticed him hoarding things there. Was so confused‚Ä¶..Now I‚Äôm not anymore.‚Äù

Swansea looked ready to start swinging his ax at the nearest body of organs. He couldn‚Äôt believe this was real. That this was some shining bullshit. 

This couldn‚Äôt go on. 

‚ÄúSwan, Daisuke, you guys gotta grab Anya and hide out in the med-bay. I‚Äôll find something. I‚Äôll find something-‚Äú You rambled on, before Anya had poked her head in. Seeing Swansea holding Daisuke, and trying to keep that ray of sunshine from finally snapping. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù She would whisper. Ever afraid if she spoke to loud that Jimmy would find her. Find her and do something else. Didn‚Äôt matter where she was. He was always breathing down her neck. One way or another. 

‚ÄúLittle junior adventurer over there wants to finish the job.‚Äù Swansea would grit his teeth, as you still kept hunting down for something. Willing to tear apart cushions. You had to find SOMETHING. Maybe you could break a chair leg, maybe you could use some wires. Maybe maybe maybe-

That‚Äôs when Anya held your shoulder. Her tired eyes pulled you away from the incoming insanity. Brought you back to reality, and had you listen. Listen for just a moment. 

‚ÄúThis is where the jugular vein is-‚Äú She begun, as she pointed to her neck. Then started to name off more vital arteries, before pulling a scalpel from her pocket. Into your hands they went, as she kept listing off every vital vein possible. Weak points every body had. 

Even a man like him. 

‚ÄúLast I saw him he was exploring the lower decks. Please‚Ä¶..Just make it quick.‚Äù As much as she hated him, she just could only bring herself to be only so cold. She could never be as cruel as Jimmy. To wish death onto someone. Never would she. 

That‚Äôs what made her forever better than him. 

‚ÄúCome on, kid. You ain‚Äôt gonna wanna see this. Get over here, Anya. Come on. Let‚Äôs go have a sleepover with Captain Curly.‚Äù He would motion her over, and she would snuggle under his arm. The two safe in his arms, as he would walk them to the med-bay. 

Was wise for him to keep the ax. That thing was what kept Jimmy from doing his own finishing of the job. You can‚Äôt over power him. No you can‚Äôt. There was also the fact Anya made sure to keep the gun hidden. You wouldn‚Äôt deny the idea it was in the med-bay somewhere. Just more protection if anything. 

They‚Äôll be safe. If you didn‚Äôt make it, at least you‚Äôll make sure Jimmy is too weak to try anything more to hurt them. Weak enough for someone else to finish the job. What mattered now was them staying away until the job was done, and for you to figure out what to do next. 

You needed that damn key. 

You would stuff your hands in your pockets, grip tight on the scalpel, and started walking. Walking, thinking, listening. Eyes glued to anything that could offer an opportunity to be jumped. You had to be vigilant. 

As you walked you would notice the door that was once Curly‚Äôs. How Jimmy didn‚Äôt deserve the luxury of what a Captain gets. Made you wonder what else he was also hoarding in that room. Maybe he was hoarding resources that should have been shared with the rest of you. There could be the slimmest chance that he was hiding away a transmitter even. Not having the guts to destroy it, and maybe even as far as to what for the rest of them to kill each other before he called for help. 

That coward. 

You had to get his keys. You needed those keys for those you love. They deserved to live. YOU deserved to live. No way in hell will Jimmy keep getting away with this. Never again. Never more. 

Your nerves were getting tighter and tighter now. Even the sound of your own heart beat was painfully loud in your head. The sweat on your skin, the itch of your skin being too tight, the pounding of drums, the feeling of air pushing at your ribcage. So much as your eyes blinking was to loud. 

Everything was to loud. 

That‚Äôs when a bang of metal hitting metal alerted you. You spun around, and was just met with nothing. Just an empty, dark, hallway. No source of the noise. Maybe there was none to begin with. Just your nerves. 

‚ÄúDeep breaths. Deep breaths. You know you have to do this. There is no other option. You can do this. For Anya, for Daisuke, and for Swansea.‚Äù

A wipe to your brow and you returned to hunting him down. 

Felt like an eternity. Just endless hallways in red lights of emergency. Hallways blocked off by foam. Was a scarlet bouncy castle of horror. Never did the ship feel so endless yet so tight. Maybe the ship itself was breathing to. 

Never did you think you would be happy to see his ugly face. 

He was down in the lower decks, seeming to be trying to access a door that Swansea had managed to block off. Swansea was stronger than he looked, and was a mechanic no less. Jerry rigged a makeshift lock for the door. If you recall correctly that was where the cryo-sleep pods were. He had been working to try and fix them up, but you doubt they survived. Guess it‚Äôs better to pretend you are doing something useful than do nothing at all. 

‚ÄúHey Jim, whatcha doing?‚Äù You tried your best to act casual, as you watched him trying to get the lock off. A mixture of locking mechanics and bent metal that kept things in place. Jimmy just didn‚Äôt have the body weight to unbend them. Who ever said being fat wasn‚Äôt useful? 

‚ÄúTrying to get into this damn room. Be useful and help me, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù He grumbled, as he kept trying to pull the metal. 

This was your chance. 

This almost felt to perfect. He was distracted, hyper focused on something, and was crouching. You would have the upper hand. You can pull this off. You just had to fight your nerves. 

‚ÄúYeah yeah yeah. I‚Äôm coming.‚Äù You would say, as you would walk closer to him. Flashes crossed your vision with each step. Was like blurs of a shadow puppet show. Visions of his talle outline pinning Anya to the ground, another of him pinning Daisuke to a wall. Even Swansea wasn‚Äôt free from the concept of being pinned to a surface and abused. 

No one was safe with Jimmy still around. 

You would soon be standing behind him, as he focused on the lock. He was right there. You just had to do it. Do what Anya showed you. His neck was exposed. It was right there. You just had to do it. 

You pulled your weapon out, and took in a deep breath. 

Just as you brought your arm to swing, Jimmy turned around. 

Happened in a flash. You made contact with his skin, but it was his cheek instead. He would tumble over, and was quick to kick your legs out from under you. Had you slam your back to the ground. Knocked the wind out of you. 

‚ÄúI fucking KNEW IT-! YOU GOD DAMN BITCH-!‚Äù Was like he wasn‚Äôt even human anymore. Just as much of an animal on the outside as he was on the inside. You had to run. You had to get out of there. You fucked up your perfect chance. Your messed up and he‚Äôs going to remind you that you did. 

You attempted to get up, but Jimmy was just that much faster than you. Your ankle was grabbed, and he was yanking you closer. You couldn‚Äôt stop yourself from screaming, as he would try and pry the medical tool from you. 

‚ÄúGET OFF OF ME YOU RAPIST PIECE OF SHIT-!‚Äù You nearly sobbed, as he stared down at you. Your wrists pinned above your head, as he just gawked at you. Was like he never even heard the word before. 

‚ÄúRapist? You think I‚Äôm a fucking rapist? You little fucking bitch. I‚Äôm no such damn thing. What happened between us was nothing of the sort. It was just what happens when someone gets in my way. Reaching your goals isn‚Äôt a crime. Is it?‚Äù He asked you, as you kept struggling under him. Trying to get away. 

‚ÄúFuck. YOU-!‚Äù And you slammed your face into his. Gave you a blinding headache instantly, but the shock of contact was enough to make him let go. You were soon crawling, and now running, away. 

‚ÄúIM GOING TO KILL YOU! IM GOING TO KILL ALL OF YOU LIKE IVE BEEN TRYING TO DO WITH CRASHING THIS STUPID SHIP!‚Äù His voice echoed like the demon from hell he was. 

You never thought such fear like this could be in your body. 

Your vision was a blurry mess from the head bang, but you just used the walls to offer you guidance. To try and find a place to breathe, and wait. To try again. You won‚Äôt give up. You refused to give up. 

‚ÄúCOME BACK HERE-! YOU CANT RUN FOREVER! THERES NOWHERE ELSE FOR YOU TO GO-!‚Äù He would threaten you. His voice just seeming to be coming from everywhere. Was like he was inside of your own head. Like he was all of your insecurities crawling through your skull, and turning your brain into a mushy puddle of doubt and fear. 

You still kept going. 

You would find yourself back into the dinning hall, and took your chance in hiding in the kitchen area. Ducking down and hiding yourself by the elevated counters. If he kept running he shouldn‚Äôt notice you. 

You would hold your knees, recollect yourself, and breathed. 

The echoes of his running foot steps were like alarm bells in your ears. To hear them get closer, more distant, then closer again. Clearly having lost where you went, but still keeping up chance. How did he have so much energy? He must have been indeed hoarding resources. No way should someone surviving off mouthwash have this much stamina. 

Your confused thoughts were cut short by the quickening pace of the foot steps. From banging on metal to proper flooring. He had entered the kitchen. He was breathing hard, and just boiling in anger. 

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs that fucking bitch? Where did that fucker go?‚Äù He would pant, as you would hear something sharp run over the counter marble. Must have grabbed a knife from his bedroom. Maybe that meant he left the door unlocked as well. 

That could be your chance to get a proper weapon. 

You just had to wait. Wait and pray he didn‚Äôt look over the counter. 

You couldn‚Äôt tell where he was looking, but you needed to risk it. You would grab for one of the spoons off the ground, and threw it as far as you could. Into the hallway to the next part of the ship. You managed to get enough distance. The sound of metal hitting on the grates was loud. You swore you could feel the head thwip of Jimmy turning towards it. 

‚ÄúFound you-!‚Äù He shouted cockily, as he ran into that direction. 

‚ÄúDumbass.‚Äù You muttered, as you soon ran the opposite way. Trying to find his room before he realized he was had. 

You even went as far as to take off your shoes, so your feet made much less noise. Harder to be tracked and followed. Never did you think listening to Daisuke ramble about horror movie logic would come in handy. Gave some weird morbid hope that maybe Anya will be a final girl and make it out of here alive. 

You would hear the foot steps echoing around you, as you tried to stalk quieter towards the dorm hallways. Was so hard to make out where they were going and coming from. The distant shouts of annoyance weren‚Äôt helping either. Was just making you more aware of your own mortality. 

Luckily you managed to find the door. He snuck inside, and closed the door. Maybe he would think he locked it behind himself and not even think of checking in there. Maybe he was dumb enough to be fooled. 

When in the room you couldn‚Äôt help but be disgusted by the sight. He really was hoarding food! The knives were also laid all out on his desk. Organized like he was planning to use them. There was also a trans communicator. Just as you thought there was. You thought it was suspicious there wasn‚Äôt a means to transfer information in case of an emergency. Even Pony Express had to have THAT. Suppose believing it was just consumed by foam was easier. Maybe it was and he dug it out himself. 

No matter. You had hope. 

You quickly grab the device, and turned it on. By god it WORKED! 

‚ÄúHello? Hello?! This is the Tulpar for The Pony Express! We‚Äôve been crash landed for months! Pony express has laid us off and hasn‚Äôt sent any rescue by proxy! Can you hear me?!‚Äù You couldn‚Äôt help but shout, as the transmitter would crackle. 

‚ÄúWe read you loud and clear. How many are on the ship?‚Äù You were sobbing. No way. Someone was actually hearing you! 

‚ÄúFive! We have five people here! One in critical condition! Captain Curly! He‚Äôs alive! Alive but having suffered the most from the crash. We are running lower on medical supplies, we have very little food, we‚Äôve been drinking fucking mouth wash to survive!‚Äù You weeped, as the person on the other end was taking in the information. 

You said five for a reason. 

‚ÄúKeep on the line with us as we track your signal. Are you in any immediate danger?‚Äù The person asked. 

‚ÄúYES YOU ARE-!‚Äù Jimmy would shout behind you, before stabbing you right in your shoulder. You screamed bloody murder, as the person on the line gasped. Despite the pain, you were keeping your grip on the communicator. You weren‚Äôt letting go. No you fucking WONT. 

‚ÄúSTUBBORN BITCH-!‚Äù He shouted at you, as you used your body to protect that communicator with all your body and life. You didn‚Äôt care if he was going to kill you now. You were getting everyone home. You were and you fufilled your mission. 

‚ÄúJust get it over with already you coward! How many people did you rape?! Huh?! Was Anya the first?! Like hell! She‚Äôs your most recent! Was Daisuke next?! Was I next?!‚Äù You called out, as you had nothing to lose anymore. You were going down with your own ship, unlike him. 

‚ÄúIf you have to know, Anya wasn‚Äôt my last at least. She really thought leaving me alone with Curly was smart. Dumb whore-‚Äú He would yank out the knife, making you bleed and scream. The hot searing pain was just beyond words. You were seeing stars, and not the kind you wanted. 

‚ÄúWas figuring how many I could get away with. Didn‚Äôt think she would actually tell anyone. Didn‚Äôt think much about her at all. Guess you live and learn. You live and l-‚Äú

Bang. 

Silence. 

Silence, the crackle of a communicator, and the ever breathing ship. 

With a thud to the ground you were able to finally gain some vision to look over. Over to see Jimmy was dead on the ground, with a bullet hole through his forehead. Those terrifying eyes were now glsssy and empty. Looked almost relaxed. The only time he seemed to rest. 

He was dead. 

Your vision was blurring, and noise around you was muffled. All you could hear was muffled noise. Was like you were underwater. Your vision was starting to blur again as well. Couldn‚Äôt make out shapes. 

You thought you saw someone with black hair above you. Seeming to grab something and speak into it. Was there something yellow to? Yellow and shaking you? There was also this almost pinkish blur as well. Came to you, and you swore you heard someone saying ‚Äòyou‚Äôre a hero‚Äô before it all went to black. 

 

One Month After The Call. 

 

‚ÄúMorning sunshine.‚Äù 

You would groan, as you rubbed at your eyes. What happened? Was it all some bad dream? Where were you? This place didn‚Äôt look like the med-bay. Was so clean and white. There were windows too. Holy shit was that daylight? REAL daylight? 

‚ÄúOver here.‚Äù

You turned your head, and you saw him. Captain Curly. Looked so much better than when you last recalled him. His skin wasn‚Äôt as red, proper bandages were on him, and his lips even seemed to be healing back. Skin graphs? Was still laying in a bed, but far more cared for. Proper bedding, clean, IV bags, and‚Ä¶Wait‚Ä¶..Did he speak?! 

‚ÄúBeen out a while. Don‚Äôt worry not much to catch you up on. You kinda went into a medical coma, from what Anya tried to explain to me. Everyone agreed to put you in the Cryo-Pod until help arrived. Was the only way to keep us both alive. All the resources had to go to me, sorry about that, so they had to pretty much freeze you in time. Big Swan had managed to make it function enough to work until the rescue team came for us. Welcome to the land of the living, hero.‚Äù

Even with his messed up complexion, and voice so hoarse you thought he himself was speaking through a communicator, you smiled. A hero huh? Wait. That meant‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúDid Anya pull the trigger?‚Äù You asked, with your own voice rasp from lack of use. 

‚ÄúYeah. Yeah she did. We heard you screaming and she just‚Ä¶.Couldn‚Äôt let you be his next victim. You gave her some bravery. I already knew she was brave, but damn. Who needs a Captain when you have her?‚Äù His laughter was painful, but you knew it was worth it. 

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs everyone else?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnya has been working with staff here. They took her in to be a doctor with them when they saw that the likes of me was still alive and functional. They really didn‚Äôt want to lose someone as smart as her. Daisuke has been glued here as much as us-‚Äú He would weakly raise his arm, what‚Äôs left anyway, towards the sleeping solider. Curled up on a spare cot that was brought in for him. The staff having been understanding that he deserved to be around you both. His parents most likely were the ones to bring in all the video games for him to play with and show Curly as well. Even after so much he was still taking care of the ones he loved. 

‚ÄúSwansea?‚Äù You worried the most, since you wondered where he could be. 

‚ÄúSueing the ever living fuck out of Pony Express for whatever damn dime they have left. Daisuke‚Äôs parents, and him, have been at the forefront on it all. He will come visit us soon. Get some rest, sunshine. You‚Äôve earned it.‚Äù But you couldn‚Äôt help but worry. A worry that one person wasn‚Äôt accounted for. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead. I do mean dead dead. By the time help arrived he had already well started decomposing. Swansea even went the extra mile and cut his head off from his body. Kinda overkill, but hey‚Ä¶.Can‚Äôt take risks with monsters. Right?‚Äù You nodded at that, as you were able to rest. 

No more Jimmy. 

No more space ships. 

Time to finally be a princess and get your beauty sleep. 

‚ÄúSleep well, sunshine.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou to, Captain.‚Äù

I‚Äôve pondered this a lot since getting into Mouthwashing.

Tl;dr, I‚Äôve observed a borderline aggressive need to be correct all the time about the themes of Mouthwashing or else you‚Äôre immediately called an immoral and awful person. And I feel like it creates an atmosphere where people are scared to speculate in case they‚Äôre perceived as evil. Or maybe that‚Äôs just me personally being scared, idk. Either way, more under the cut (spoilers, obviously)

<!-- more --> After first finishing Mouthwashing, there was a lot I didn‚Äôt notice. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm an oblivious person. I didn‚Äôt understand what the hibiscus meant. I had no clue what the whole scene with turning the wheels with Curly meant. I didn‚Äôt even realize what Jimmy did to Anya, let alone what the conversation between Anya and Swansea was about or why Anya hid the gun.

It took scrolling through Tumblr, reading other people‚Äôs analysis in order to fully understand the story. Even then, I went back and watched another playthrough once I had a better understanding.

But what I found in the fandom was a lot of hostility towards people who didn‚Äôt understand the whole picture yet, or people who had the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô idea. I saw a disturbing amount of people who were saying things along the lines of ‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt understand the story this way, then you‚Äôre just as bad as Jimmy/Curly‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre also an enabler, you‚Äôre a bystander, etc.‚Äù

I believe Mouthwashing‚Äôs story having the themes it does is an effort to spread awareness about them, and I feel like that‚Äôs a pretty universally agreed upon sentiment. But things like this, that are complex and have a lot of grey area, some people just aren‚Äôt going to understand immediately, and that‚Äôs why the game exists. To tell a story, and to teach. Hopefully in time, the messages, symbolism, etc will sink in and people will understand and be better. And some people aren‚Äôt gonna get it immediately. Everyone has vastly different perspectives, so it might take some time or even some convincing for people to truly understand it. But personally I don‚Äôt think screaming at people is the way to go lmao

As in, if someone discerns that their abuser is so dangerous that they have to hide weapons from them, then your responsibility as captain is to 1.) take your crewmate‚Äôs judgment on the situation seriously and 2.) lock the fuck in and be on guard for the very real threat that is onboard your ship. Especially on a spaceship where you cannot risk the possibility of another person escalating to the point of violence

When Jimmy said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take care of it‚Äù after Curly heavily implied that he knew that Anya was pregnant (and Jimmy implied that he didnt know what to do with his life going forward) and went into the cockpit, alarm bells should have been going off in his head. And Curly knew prior to this that they were going into a particularly rocky region of space! Of course, the blame rests squarely on Jimmy for attempting to kill everyone, but I think if Curly was a really really good captain, he would have taken the threat seriously and put safety first. 

It really says so much about how misogynistic Curly is for him to know that Anya thinks Jimmy could be dangerous and still leave him alone in the cockpit anyway. And to think that the first thing he immediately says upon seeing Jimmy there with the system warnings is ‚ÄúJim, tell me you didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù and not ‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you do!!‚Äù ?

The writer(s) of Mouthwashing handled Anya just as poorly as Curly handled her situation. 

Whereas Curly‚Äôs neglect of Anya, her situation and choosing to be a friend to Jimmy (the same man who threatens Curly outright before the crash) over Anya /the crews well-being , the writing neglects to give Anya a voice or even character unlike everyone and everything else in the story; including the damn mascot.

Like most horror, women are easily made into victims but rarely do some of these writers have the depth to properly handle what being a victim means/carries. I get far more insight how the writers feel about women themselves than the message they want to share about the women they write.

Why should you deserve a pat on a back for writing the same horror tropes women are put in and create a story that feels like someone‚Äôs poor understand of women‚Äôs studies and easily missed the purpose of why such studies exists beyond to tell people ‚Äúmen‚Ä¶ rape‚Ä¶ rape‚Ä¶bad‚Ä¶‚Äù

The audience is given insight to everyone else on who they are, how they feel, and what they are like except Anya. I can‚Äôt even give them credit for breaking the fourth wall when the fourth wall has a giant Anya shaped hole that feels so jarring. Why can‚Äôt we know things she likes or how she feels about her own abusers? The fact that the creators missed out on an opportunity to use environmental story telling for her is so frustrating. 

The entire time we see her she‚Äôs just a victim. She is in survivor mode before anyone else is and even the one moment it appears we get insight of her feeling and thoughts‚Ä¶ its to talk about abuse. I couldn‚Äôt even think if she had asked Jimmy to do give Curly the medicine out of pettiness, imagined kindness, indifference?? We have nothing to work with beyond her being bad at her job.

Manipulation

 

 

‚ÄúMouthwashing‚Äù

 

The game isn‚Äôt called Mouthwashing JUST because everyone ends up drinking mouthwash and the ship transports mouthwash. 

It‚Äôs bc Jimmy is trying to wash all of the negative things about him out of other‚Äôs mouths. For example, Jimmy claimed he was the ‚Äúhero‚Äù, trying to make himself seem good in front of Curly, despite all of the stuff he thinks about Jim and the cruel stuff he‚Äôs caused to him. 

He wanted to wash the bad words about him out of his mouth. 

 

Jimmy made everyone at Curly‚Äôs party end up hating him, over something that wasn‚Äôt his fault. He wanted to seem good in everyone‚Äôs eyes, and so they wouldn‚Äôt think negatively about him. 

 

He always tries to make himself seem like the VICTIM, so people will feel bad and will have a less chance of saying horrible things about him.

This little critter does well in burying herself in too much work and meticulously putting herself together, only to fall apart again. Quite the diligent worker, and clever, too, yet unravels all over again in the face of emotional labor.

 

She does her best to put on a brave face, though! However, it‚Äôs about as brave as a mouse in the face of a lion. Poor little navy officer shoved last minute into space‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs painfully aware of how badly she sticks out, overcompensating by trying to pull all the weight she can. She only burns herself out, though‚Ä¶ but hey, it could be worse! 

 

At least the crew seems friendly enough!

My name is Matthias Clooney. I‚Äôm the custodian on the ship. I try not to get in the way of the rest of the crew while they do their jobs. Don‚Äôt mind me. Give a shout if you need my assistance though. I do the majority of my work after everyone has retired to sleep, but I take care of any tasks during the waking hours as needed. I‚Äôll clean anything up, but please do your best to clean up after yourselves, it‚Äôs much appreciated. I enjoy after hour drinks with Swansea. It‚Äôs nice to talk to him over some age appropriate beverages.

CW: SUBSTANCE ABUSE, MOUTHWASHING SPOILERS I‚Äôm gonna use ‚Äúprobably‚Äù and ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù a lot in this because so much of this game is from Jimmy‚Äôs perspective and he dgaf about Swansea until close to the end.

Okay, so Swansea is first and foremost, a very tired, very ragged mechanic who‚Äôs probably pushing 60. He doesn‚Äôt want to be on that ship. He doesn‚Äôt want anything. He wants, at least at first, to just be done with this job and get paid. He respects Curly but he‚Äôs annoyed by and dismissive of everyone else on the ship, especially Daisuke.

So much of Swansea‚Äôs character is reliant on and paralleled to his relationship with Daisuke. When he meets Daisuke, Daisuke is happy and optimistic. He looks forward to things and tries to impress Swansea when Swansea doesn‚Äôt want help. 

The main reason Swansea doesn‚Äôt like Daisuke ties into his alcohol abuse. Daisuke is always, at almost every point we see him pre Anya locking herself in medical, happy and energetic. Swansea hates this about him because that‚Äôs a state of being he hasn‚Äôt achieved, in his own words, in 15 years. He can‚Äôt imagine being that happy while sober and it pisses him off. He‚Äôs half jealous because of that and half jealous because Daisuke is young and has a long life ahead of him. Swansea does not like the life he built for himself while sober, but that‚Äôs for later. Especially after they get laid off, the only one who has anything ahead of them was Daisuke. Swansea would have trouble getting another job both because of his age and because a lot of things on Earth were being automated. 

Of course, after the crash, that jealousy becomes something else. Because Daisuke is the only one who has anything ahead of them, he‚Äôs the only one whose life matters. Swansea loves his family, but he doesn‚Äôt really like them. He‚Äôs most likely worked with Pony Express the longest, so he knows they most likely won‚Äôt be saved. They have one chance left, one cryopod for one person. He‚Äôs saving it for Daisuke because Daisuke is only one with a chance.

Now bringing up Anya. I think it was 2 months in when Anya told him about Jimmy. Here I‚Äôd like to correct some things I said in other posts. In my Anya rant I said ‚ÄúHe has the one last working cryo pod set aside for her specifically and refuses to let anyone into the room where it is.‚Äù He felt bad for her, no doubt, but he probably doesn‚Äôt actually do that. He, more likely, tells her ‚ÄúHey, there‚Äôs actually a crypod left. I‚Äôm saving it for Daisuke. It‚Äôs not like either of us have things waiting on the other side of this.‚Äù Swansea isn‚Äôt responsible for Anya in the way Curly was. He respects her well enough as coworkers but they‚Äôre not at all close. He doesn‚Äôt feel any real need to put her in priority, especially with the dire situation at hand. I don‚Äôt think he doesn‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs just not something he sees in his jurisdiction. And I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs nothing he could‚Äôve done. Had literally anyone at any point in the game killed Jimmy, a lot of problems would be fixed. But, unlike Curly, Swansea doesn‚Äôt have as many options.

When they open the cargo hold and he starts drinking again, he rediscovers happiness. I‚Äôd actually like to apologize for something quickly. I made a short comic in which Swansea comforts Anya after she tells him about Jimmy (which he doesn‚Äôt actually do, smh bro) and in the caption I had said ‚ÄúI love you sm Swansea I wish you weren‚Äôt an alcoholic üòî‚Äù (It‚Äôs also my most popular fanart on here and I‚Äôm very thankful for that ^^)

I don‚Äôt blame Swansea for his alcoholism. It‚Äôs an addiction just as much as anything else and no one should have to go through that. I personally though have had bad experiences with alcoholics and I‚Äôm generally uncomfortable around them. I definitely worded that caption poorly and I apologize for that, but I had meant it in an ‚ÄúI wish you were sober‚Äù way. I know that the caption had rubbed people the wrong way, so I wanted to apologize.

So Swansea is drunk and happy for the first time in fifteen years. Despite his intoxicated state, he still has his one goal and that‚Äôs to save the last cryopod for Daisuke. He knows that‚Äôs what he wants and he sticks to it. It‚Äôs just him and the ax against the world. Eventually, Jimmy takes the ax to get the extra painkillers and the ax kinda just disappears for a while. Like I have no idea where it went but Swansea has it again by the time he offs Daisuke.

Speaking of which, Swansea kills Daisuke. Framing-wise it‚Äôs probably my favorite scene in the game, like the breathing and Swansea‚Äôs speech. Chat, I love this scene. Anyways, Jimmy offers Swansea a drink as a ‚Äúpeace offering.‚Äù Swansea is never sober at this point in the game but even he can appreciate a good cocktail, especially when he‚Äôs been slogging mouthwash for months. Honestly, he doesn‚Äôt trust Jimmy like AT ALL at this point, but Daisuke helped him with the cocktail. 

Swansea is kinda putting his hopes in Daisuke. Like obviously, he‚Äôs placing hope in Daisuke‚Äôs survival, but I think he‚Äôs also seeing this optimistic, bright-eyed kid who‚Äôs struggling as himself at the start of his sobrity. Daisuke said that the reason he got this job was because he was directionless in life. He had nothing to look forward to and no goals. The difference between him and Swansea is Daisuke‚Äôs parents got the job for him and Swansea had to do it himself. So in that way he started to appreciate how happy Daisuke was, which is more reason to hate that he‚Äôs there.

Swansea passes out from the cocktail and when he wakes up Anya is dead and Daisuke is in critical condition. Anya‚Äôs gone which means they‚Äôre out of a medic so that makes Daisuke‚Äôs situation a lot worse. But because Jimmy used the Isopropyl to knock out Swansea, they‚Äôre out of disinfectant. They have to use mouthwash which is established early on to have too much sugar to be disinfectant. So they kinda made it worse because Swansea and Jimmy are idiots who didn‚Äôt listen to Anya. After a few hours of Daisuke slowly bleeding out, Swansea mercy kills him. it. looks. so. cool. During this speech, Swansea says something along the lines of ‚ÄúStick a kid with a bunch of sad-sack adults and see what he learns. Bootstraps and all that.‚Äù He really hates that Daisuke is here, it‚Äôs just that the reason has changed. Before the crash, Curly and Daisuke were the only two who weren‚Äôt like clinically depressed. After the crash, only Daisuke can find it in himself to stay optimistic, but even his faith is dwindling (Jimmy is optimistic too, but that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs crazy).

Right after that, he chases Jimmy around with the ax until Jimmy ties him up and shoots him. This is when Swansea lore drops about himself. He explains that he literally has not been happy or enjoyed his life in 15 years. He‚Äôs done everything he‚Äôs supposed to when it comes to leading a good, healthy life, but it‚Äôs not at all fulfilling. He hates his job, he doesn‚Äôt look forward to seeing his family, he just killed the last speck of joy on this metal space coffin, and he has nothing to live for. He‚Äôs already fallen back into addiction so even if he got back to Earth, he‚Äôd ruin his life all over again. He‚Äôd be happy, but his life would be ruined. And then Jimmy shoots him.

Now here‚Äôs a little health fact! Swansea was dying the whole game. People suffering from alcohol abuse often end up drinking Listerine when other alcoholic drinks aren‚Äôt available. Now I‚Äôm just speculating and projecting, but Swansea is definitely a beer guy, that‚Äôs his go-to. His tolerance suggests he was a craft kinda guy (which has an ABV between 5 and 10% (idk this is from memory)) or someone who drank a lot really quickly, but the mouthwash was 14% ethanol. That, in and of itself isn‚Äôt the main problem, though it is noteworthy that he was already drinking more than usual. The main problem is that drinking mouthwash will absolutely destroy your stomach and intestinal linings. Mouthwash isn‚Äôt just alcohol and flavoring, there‚Äôs other chemicals in it too. On a good day, you‚Äôll get a nasty stomach ache, but you‚Äôll live. One to many though, and you are dead or in a coma. Like no joke that will kill you, especially if you drink a lot of it in such a short amount of time. That‚Äôs why they keep saying ‚Äúthat stuff will kill you before anything else will,‚Äù because it‚Äôs actively killing them. Swansea probably knew this but he‚Äôs prone to self-destruction so he probably didn‚Äôt care. Anyway, hope you enjoyed that little health fact, I love reading medical journals ask me anything.

While writing this, I paused and started scrolling on tiktok and I saw a video where someone was complaining about the sudden villainization of Swansea in the fandom. I‚Äôve literally seen nothing like this, but in the video they said one of the critiques people had of Swansea was that he was just as bad as Curly for not doing anything about Jimmy. That‚Äôs insane, that is a batshit crazy take and I rebuke it. For one, Swansea was never Jim‚Äôs friend. He never set people up to be victimized by Jimmy, he never enabled Jimmy‚Äôs behavior or tried to comfort him when he was the problem. This was just a crazy thing to say, please learn to comprehend thing beyond the main text.

Um.. uh‚Ä¶ conclusion paragraph, I love Swansea and I love to pretend he was more proactive against Jimmy for Anya‚Äôs sake, but he wasn‚Äôt so it‚Äôs whatever he‚Äôs not real anyway. I feel like this ended up being really long, like longer than the other two but idk.

Jimmy: Is civil with him, but also has this really umcomfortable feeling around him that just sits in his gut whenever they talk. Ivan thinks this is just because he doesn‚Äôt know him very well.

Swansea: He sort of sees him as a parental/mentor figure, but doesn‚Äôt mention it to anyone Would be embarassed if he ever found out.

* Chemistry, Biology, and science in general

* Programming and Computer Science

Dislikes:

* Hyperfixations clogging up his brain and making it hard to think

* When people tease him for his music taste

EXTRA INFO!!! Ivan specializes in Chemistry. He knows a lot about Biology, and enjoys it too, but Chemistry is what got him into science in the first place.

There are multiple mentions in the game of them being short on painkillers, suggesting someone had been skimming inventory. The painkillers are opioids.

Ivan‚Äôs relationships with everyone! Anya: He thinks she‚Äôs cool and enjoys spending time with her!!

Daisuke: Thinks he‚Äôs funny, jokes around a lot with him

Curly: He has a bit of a thing for Curly, but doesn‚Äôt really open up or talk about it. It‚Äôs a little bit obvious, though. (loves him 2 death fr fr‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.)

(ooc: for the sake of roleplaying with other ppl im not gonna rp this dynamic and itll probably be more of like a friendship between him and curly)

Jimmy: Is civil with him, but also has this really umcomfortable feeling around him that just sits in his gut whenever they talk. Ivan thinks this is just because he doesn‚Äôt know him very well.

Swansea: He sort of sees him as a parental/mentor figure, but doesn‚Äôt mention it to anyone Would be embarassed if he ever found out.

likes and dislikes!! Likes:

* Chemistry, Biology, and science in general

* Programming and Computer Science

* Math 

* Game design, Character design, and storytelling

Dislikes:

* When he can‚Äôt sleep

* Hyperfixations clogging up his brain and making it hard to think

* When people tease him for his music taste

EXTRA INFO!!! Ivan specializes in Chemistry. He knows a lot about Biology, and enjoys it too, but Chemistry is what got him into science in the first place.

!!! SPOILERS FOR MOUTHWASHING, CAN‚ÄôT PUT A READ MORE ON MOBILE !!! 

the game is told from two perspectives: Curly before the crash, Jimmy after the crash. The player controls either one of the two in the corresponding times, and I think the concept of ‚Äúprotagonist‚Äù plays a big role here. Before the crash, Curly is the protagonist. He‚Äôs the captain everyone listens to and tries his best (more or less) to be a leader, a friend, a beacon for everyone. Jimmy is an old friend of his, but ultimately an NPC in Curly‚Äôs perspective. And the game shows that Jimmy is very jealous of that. He wants to be a big shot too. He wants to be someone others look up to. He wants to ‚Äútake responsibility‚Äù.

The crash happens and Curly is left burned and limbless and voiceless and now Jimmy is the protagonist. We, the player, control him and thus we get his very limited and unreliable perspective on everyone else. And Jimmy loves being the ‚Äúprotagonist‚Äù. The game is even warped story wise so we only learn in the end that it was Jimmy who caused the crash, not Curly. With Jimmy as the protagonist, every other character is subject to his perspective: for example, when Anya locks herself in Medical to end her life, Jimmy influences Daisuke to believe that Anya would kill Curly, although she‚Äôs shown nothing but compassion and selflessness for the other characters all game. It‚Äôs easy for the player to get caught up in that, as seen in players being totally fine with drugging Swansea to enter Utility and rarely questioning if the character they‚Äôre controlling is being reliable or not. 

The game being warped through Jimmy‚Äôs influence also shows itself in other instances: during the one time Jimmy and Anya talk alone in the hallway, Jimmy lashes out at her. He yells about the ‚Äútasks‚Äù he‚Äôs been given and the order of them, resulting in the tasks the player can see in the user interface starting to flicker and change according to what he yells. This is showing how meta wise the game is being influenced by Jimmy being the protagonist, having to bend to his will and act accordingly. But we also see the game fight back: during the hallucinatory vent sequence, the player has the option to turn around after seeing a piece of paper that reminds them to ‚Äútake responsibility‚Äù and when turning around and facing away, thus not facing responsibility, the game snaps the player back to face the paper again. It looks like the whole game is a representation of the protagonist struggle between Curly and Jimmy. Curly, the ‚Äúnatural protagonist‚Äù is hijacked by Jimmy‚Äôs actions, making Jimmy the new protagonist of the game. He tries to fulfill the role according to what he thinks he has to do, but he‚Äôs not good at it, resulting in the game being told out of chronological order, to show the player both sides of the coin. 

And even the finale of the game is a representation of the ‚Äúprotagonist struggle‚Äù between Jimmy and Curly. In the end, after everyone is dead except them, Jimmy (controlled by the player) takes Curly to the one functioning cryo pod, his last action as a protagonist. Then, in the last scene, the perspectives are switched again. The player looks through the eyes of Curly inside the cryo pod, seeing Jimmy outside ultimately walk to the side and kill himself with a gunshot. As the credits of the game play, the cryo pod is starting to freeze Curly and the player is stuck as him in the pod, ending the game. It shows that Jimmy didn‚Äôt manage to grow into the role he so desperately wanted, bc his last action as the protagonist is giving away responsibility, directly back to Curly. Jimmy can end the game as an NPC again and avoid taking responsibility, while Curly is the one now faced with an undetermined future, worse off than before.

<!-- more --> ANYA: I gave her the nighttime screen because shes associated primarily with it. but in addition to that, I chose the nightscreen for her death being the brightest thing for her in the darkest time (why the moon is on hery) she takes power away from jimmy by making that choice. If you look in her eyes, you will see a bottle of pills. yeah. you get it. The glass shatter also represents her death

SWANSEA: first of all, I‚Äôve grown up drawing nothing but twinks and furries. drawing swansea was the most fun ive ever had drawing something completely new. fat old man supremacy. okay, but i chose the sunset screen for swansea as he is a fading light. still bright, sticking around, but ‚Äúon his way out.‚Äù i added some pink to the water reflection to represent Daisuke and his influence on Swansea. Also there is a gun in his eyes. and the bullet hole glass. It‚Äôs chaotic due to the nature of the wound (thanks jimbus) and for the fact i couldn‚Äôt figure out how to do two bullet wounds.

DAISUKE (üéâ): i picked the daylight screen for daisuke because of his bright personality. the clouds represent his doubt in being on the tulpar, but insistence on making the most of it. he has a slit on his brow and i hand it to you to decide which you like more. Either a scar from skateboarding that he tells people is from getting into a fight, or alternatively just something he does to be cool. he has an axe highlight in his eyes, in addition to the glass shatter being that of an axe hitting glass. chaotic, messy, but ensuring a mercy kill. thats why it‚Äôs not clean at all.

Jimmy and Curly: Originally, jimmy was facing the viewer, and curly was also looking to the viewer. after an artistic fit of mania, i completely restructured him to turn his back on both the tulpar crew and the viewer. he looks to the viewer instead of curly, because he wants to be seen. even if he cannot face his actions (or us, the player.) I decided to put him in the blood ocean in curly‚Äôs nightmares. jimmy displaces himself from a place of friendship to one belonging in nightmares. specifically for his treatment of curly. he invades curly‚Äôs greatest fears as an unseen horror. i also realized curly would be looking to jimmy, as he never looks away from him in the game. gunshot glass shatter for jimmy too. its especially pretty because it was the best thing his ass could have done (i just thought it looked cool. no symbolism there)

stupid fun facts, to get references for jimmy i used vrchat.

Take what I‚Äôm about to say with a grain of salt seeing how I need to analyze the game more but yeah. Here‚Äôs why I think that (spoilers for Mouthwashing)

They‚Äôre both bad people. But only Swansea is self aware of that. Jimmy tries to claim he‚Äôs good, claiming he‚Äôs the hero when all his efforts just hurt everyone else around him. Jimmy (horribly) attempts to overcompensate. Swansea accepts he‚Äôs bad

Curly and Daisuke is one of the reasons I think these 2 characters are meant to be compared and contrasted. Jimmy, when dealing with someone suffering, prolongs it. Torturing them because he wants to be morally correct, because killing them be ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. Swansea just puts them down and out of their misery (literally a perfect showcase of both their characters)

What makes Swansea different from Jimmy, (besides knowing he‚Äôs a bad already) unlike Jimmy, Swanson cares for others. He knows he‚Äôs bad so he has no reason to attempt to be a hero, so he‚Äôs willing to do ‚Äúbad things‚Äù for others (putting down Daisuke, attempting to kill jimmy, lying about the cryogenic pod). Jimmy just cares for himself, so he does ‚Äúgood things‚Äù that would make himself the hero (keeping curly alive, drugging Swanson, manipulating Daisuke to go into the vent)

Also in the dream scene with Swansea they‚Äôre both try murdering the other, showing how they‚Äôre similar. But yet again look at the motives. Swansea is attacking for the people who died (and curly), Jimmy is fighting for himself. They‚Äôre both at the same extreme for 2 completely different reasons.

Speaking of death and murder, despite Jimmy being the reason everyone dies he doesn‚Äôt actually kill them himself. Anya was pushed to take her own life by Jimmy and Daisuke was killed by Swanson. The only people Jimmy kills in a literal sense are himself and Swanson

Also just look at Swansea‚Äôs monologue when Jimmy kills him, it‚Äôs literally everything I said but poetic

So in conclusion:Ôøº

Jimmy is a selfish monster who takes. Swanson is a man who has nothing left to take, so he gives.

Curly believes in forgiveness and second chances, Curly tells Anya that our worst moments don‚Äôt make us monsters. But that forgiveness turns to giving Jimmy a second chance, a third chance, of pulling him along into this career under the steadfast and resolute belief that Jimmy can change and Will change if Curly just gives him an opportunity to. The exact beliefs that make him a good captain are the ones that cause him to try and resolve conflicts without rocking the boat, that lead to him keeping a man who has assaulted another coworker as his second in command because he wants to be fair and give everyone equal treatment, he wants to keep the peace, he wants to preserve the status quo. 

The things that make him a good man also make him a bad one. There Are no monsters. There are only people who believe they‚Äôre doing the right thing, and that‚Äôs the horror of it all. Curly never COULD have condemned Jimmy, because Curly ultimately believes in the good in people. To make him write off his lifelong friendship would require a fundamental change in his worldview. Curly is a Good Man. Curly wants to be a Good Man. Curly HAS to believe our worst moments don‚Äôt make us monsters, it is what Good Men believe.
