You knew whose they were even if they might not have been very close to what she looked like in real life. You did your best to recall the shape of her eyelids the angle of her lower lash line the curve of her lashes. You found your eraser automatically without even having to look for it your hand reaching for it blindly. You changed the shape of her canthi concluding that they were slightly too dominant to match her appearance simultaneously shading in some of the whites of the eyeballs to soften the sketch and make it more lifelike. You glanced up at your professor hearing a couple words she was saying about George Eliot’s style of writing but it all blurred into nothingness the second your eyes moved down to the paper beneath you. She was waiting for you. She wanted to see you again spend time with you. Nothing in the world could have possibly made you focus on the lecture no matter how much you knew you should have been paying attention. Your daydreams were back her captivating presence had once again conquered your mind your newfound information only feeding your daydreams.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Your pencil came to a stop against the paper your eyes falling out of focus. You were beyond tired. You wanted to close your eyes so badly your mind immediately searching for comfort slowly starting to recall the previous night and just how cozy you had been in your bed with Natasha. You wondered what it would’ve been like to actually have her there wondered how much better it would have been to rest your head against her chest instead of your fluffy pillow. Your heart actually ached from longing as you imagined yourself in her arms. You had never even hugged her but you could envision the way she would wrap those strong arms of hers around you and hold you long after you fell asleep. You thought about other things that typically happened in bed your mind and heart racing in tandem as you thought about kissing her. You could almost feel the way her breath would tickle your chin see the way she would look at you with those green eyes right before she would press her pink lips to yours and steal your breath away.  “Y/N what did you think about Ladislaw?” Your eyes snapped up to meet your professor’s your cheeks flushing warm. Crap getting caught daydreaming was clearly becoming a staple during lectures.  “I- I… um.” What had Natasha said about his character? Something about him being fickle. No not fickle maybe an idealist. Hopelessly in love with Dorothea that was for sure. He was artistic and liked politics. “He’s a bit rebellious. Kind of an outsider at times.” You tried to be vague to avoid saying anything that could have been considered wrong.  “That’s right” the professor replied grasping your statement and starting to expand its implications. “He doesn’t seem to quite belong anywhere isn’t that right?” You nodded your head looking at the professor until her gaze shifted to someone else signifying that she was no longer addressing you directly your eyes falling out of focus again as she kept talking. “Did you guys notice that he doesn’t seem to belong to any social class?” From then on you were gone until the end of the class your mind wandering far far away from Middlemarch.  You nearly jumped up from your seat the second your professor started to wrap up the lecture your books and notebooks getting shoved into your school bag with such vigor they nearly missed your bag altogether. You wrapped your scarf around your neck tugged on your coat and swung your bag over your shoulder leaving the classroom in an instant. You hurried down a flight of stairs beelining straight into the women’s bathroom to check your appearance. You looked at yourself in the mirror for a while studying your features noting the very same flaws that you knew to be there since birth. You walked a bit closer digging up some lipstick from a pocket in your bag applying it carefully to enhance the dull color of your lips. It helped a little your fingers coming up to brush over your brows and lashes as if adjusting them and then you just stared at yourself hoping that you were enough to appeal to the older woman who you were falling for faster and harder than you even realized.  Upon entering the university library your eyes scanned your surroundings with a certain vigilance searching for your desired person eventually spotting her sitting by a table with a book open in front of her. She had two takeout cups of coffee beside her her elbow leaning against the edge of the table as she played idly with her earring eyes fixed on the pages. She was so beautiful so uncommonly gorgeous that you had to pause for a moment as you just stared at her observing the picturesque sight that she was your eyes noting every little detail of her appearance. She adjusted her loose curls with her left hand leaving her silver earring alone for a moment as she raked her fingers through the auburn locks. They fell beautifully around her slim face the color accentuating the paleness of her complexion. Once satisfied with her hair her hand moved to her face to swipe across the underside of her round nose as if to get rid of an itch before her hand went right back to one of the many earrings she had. You felt like you couldn’t move suddenly very nervous to disturb her in any way. She looked so peaceful so in her element that you didn’t dare to intervene and thankfully you didn’t have to. Her eyes flicked up from the table landing right on your own as if she would have felt your gaze on her. She lifted her head up to see you better offering a small smile to you the slight tilt of her head beckoning you to come closer. You looked down at the floor a shy smile on your face as you headed over to her doing your best to control your nerves.  “Hey solnishka” she nearly whispered mindful of the other people in the library. You gave her a bright smile as you seated yourself beside her on a chair that she pulled back for you.  “Hi.” You blushed violently for no apparent reason your stomach fluttering weakly with butterflies. Oh how silly of you to feel so deeply so strongly toward a woman who could merely be classified as an acquaintance. She pulled you a bit closer by your arm leaning down to kiss your cheek as a greeting much like she had done the last time you had parted ways. You felt dizzy.  “How was class? Did you learn anything new?” Her eyes were inquiring that small smirk always ever-present on her lips.  “It was okay nothing crazy.” All you had learned was that you were falling in love with her and the erratic thud of your heart only confirmed your suspicions. Your eyes dropped down to her lips. You could just kiss her. If you somehow gathered up the courage you could just lean forward and place your lips on her pillowy ones. Nothing was stopping you from going after her. There were no rules no restrictions just two friendly people who got along with each other more than well. Surely there was nothing wrong with wanting to kiss her wanting to feel her body against your own. And there truly was nothing wrong with it but you eventually tore your eyes away from her mouth focusing on your bag as you dug out your laptop copy of Middlemarch and her umbrella that you returned to her.  “Thank you” she said with a small smile placing the accessory over her purse that sat on the floor. “You didn’t fall asleep in class” she said teasingly handing you the large mug of coffee from the table. “Here’s your drink. I need to keep that smart brain of yours sharp and focused.” You pursed your lips slightly trying to hide your reaction to her attentive words.  “Thanks. I didn’t but I wasn’t far from it.” You chuckled softly grasping the mug into your cold fingers surprised to find it still hot to touch. “What’d you get me?”  “Guess.” She gave you a small smirk that you returned immediately as you brought the mug to your lips taking a careful sip of the drink in case it would burn you. The warm liquid coated your tongue your eyes fluttering shut on their own as you allowed the sweet and creamy drink to surprise your taste buds. There was a very strong blend of spices mixed in the flavor something you recognized but you failed to pinpoint where you knew it from.  “Mm that’s so good” you hummed taking another sip that was followed by a small groan her smile widening. “What is it?”  “A dirty chai latte” she murmured holding your gaze knowingly the mirth behind her eyes coming off as playful like she had been waiting for you to ask for the name.  “Ohh that’s what it was.” The flavor suddenly made much more sense as you slowly recognized its familiar depth.  “Have you ever had one before?”  “Not a dirty one” you said failing to wipe the smile off your face the tension between you far too exciting.  “It’s my favorite. Especially the dirty part” she hummed earning an amused eye roll from you. “I like them extra dirty.” She whispered it to you like it was a secret.  “And how dirty are we talking?” You inquired arching a brow at her words your eyes nailed on hers. It was hard to sort out what you were feeling the intensity of the emotion making it difficult for you to identify it. All you knew was that there was a strong pull an irresistible force that drew you to her like a magnet.  “Sometimes I take a double shot of espresso. It balances out the sweetness.” She eyed your cup for a moment watching you take another sip. “Do you like it?”  “I love it. But I won’t lie it could be dirtier.” Natasha’s smirk widened into a pleased little grin.  “Glad you agree.”  “What did you get?” Your eyes dropped down to the cup between her hands noting that her knuckles were slightly bruised a bit of cool toned purple pushing through the paleness of her skin hues of crimson and greenish yellow marking the area. You wanted to ask but didn’t deeming it inappropriate. Besides you really shouldn’t have been all that protective of her when you most likely meant nothing at all to her.  “Oh just a regular latte in case you had a vendetta against chai or something” she chuckled her fingers playing with the paper cup. “I’ve noticed that it often divides opinions.”  “Natasha” you sighed in a mild chastise for her thoughtfulness her attention suddenly fully on you as if she had been caught off guard by you using her name. “That’s so sweet of you. You should’ve just gotten your favorite.” A small frown found your face. “Here you can have some of mine.” You offered the cup to her.  “Thank you” she hummed with a certain softness to her features as your other hand came up to the cup to remove the lid your fingers starting to pry it off. “Don’t bother darling.” Her hand pushed yours away gently the lid remaining in place. “I don’t mind.” She gave you a small smile as she grabbed the mug and brought it to her lips pressing her mouth over the small hole the very same place where your lips had been just a moment before. She had a way of dominating the atmosphere with the simplest of acts. She merely took a small sip of the drink yet managed to steal your breath away your eyes lingering on her lips. You were practically kissing and there was nothing in the world that could have convinced you otherwise. You felt a spark of thrill go through you.  “Ah that hits the spot. It’s like Christmas in a cup. Thank you.” She handed the drink back to you her eyes flitting down to your mouth. You were sure of it. She looked at your lips. You were more than glad for having made the decision to put on some lipstick no matter how little it probably did for your poor lips that were struggling to adjust to the cold climate that was creeping up on you.  “It is. Dare I even say better than pumpkin spice?” Natasha gave you a look of disbelief sarcastically suggesting you that your statement was nothing short of preposterous.  “Beware krasotka the autumn fanatics will come for you.”  “Let them come. I’ll show them the gingerbread candle in my living room and the Christmas playlist that’s been in my ‘recently played’ since September.” She laughed at your retort scrunching her nose the slightest bit. You couldn’t tell what it meant but it filled you with warmth the adorable gesture lingering in your mind. You wanted to see it again.  “Oh see now you’re crossing a line” she said the air of gaiety that surrounded you only strengthened by your camaraderie. It felt strange to talk to someone with an equal amount of wit it felt strange to be with someone of your own kind someone with depth and nuance someone who complimented you. “You gotta wait at least until Thanksgiving.”  “Eh I like a head start.” You looked down at your hands fidgeting with the long sleeves of your knit sweater your hands resting on the table beside hers. You thought about what she had said regarding hands and their intimacy your cheeks heating at the thought of holding her own. You were so close and she was right there. “That way I get the most of it.” You glanced up at her moving your hands as if unintentionally your fingers brushing against hers. They were cool to touch despite the multiple layers of clothing she wore your heart clenching at the feel of her soft skin. With bated breath you waited for her to pull her hand away to adjust her cup or take a sip of coffee to break the connection like you had expected her to but she didn’t. You felt abnormally shy all of a sudden uncertainty consuming you squeezing at your chest when there was no reaction on her part. You didn’t want to be pushy slowly drawing your hand back enough to break contact despite how much you would have wanted more. You should’ve probably started your assignment anyway. You pulled away from the table altogether focusing on the laptop you had brought with you Natasha seemingly completely unfazed. “What were you reading?” You asked her as you started up your laptop your gaze shifting to the book that she had moved to the side to give you more tabletop space.  “Zhila-byla zhenshchina kotoraya khotela ubit’ sosedskogo rebenka by Ludmilla Petrushevskaya.” The Russian rolled off her tongue so naturally that it shocked you the language switch bringing out the lower register of her voice a tone you had yet to hear properly. If you had thought she sounded attractive when speaking English you had been far from prepared to hear how her Russian sounded. “The English name for it is There Once Lived A Woman Who Tried To Kill Her Neighbor’s Baby” she elaborated correctly assuming that you hadn’t understood a word of what she had said.  “That’s quite the title. What’s it about?” And so the assignment had once again found its way into oblivion as you two discovered yet another topic to discuss. It wasn’t until well past two in the afternoon that you finally managed to redirect the conversation back to Victorian literature. You turned your attention back to your laptop and got to work creating a fresh document for you to write your essay into Natasha focusing on your copy of Middlemarch to look for examples to use in your assignment.  Working with her was nearly impossible and it tested the very limits of your willpower your gaze shifting back and forth between the screen and her pretty face. It felt like no words came to you every time you tried to type something into your sparsely filled-out document. You had managed an introduction paragraph the date and your name despite how much time had already passed since you had officially started working on it. You were good at writing you liked writing but with her there all you could do was curse your mind for being so disorganized and blank at the same time. You felt verbally constipated the emotional high you were experiencing consuming your mind whole yet for some reason you wouldn’t have changed it for the world. You hadn’t been as happy and full of life as you were at the moment in months. You hadn’t felt anything all summer and sitting there observing her appearance her demeanor you realized that you had been miserable long enough for it to have become your norm. So how could anyone blame you for taking an extra minute or two to look at her? Who could blame you for ignoring your schoolwork? Who could blame you for falling head over heels for someone who was slowly bringing back your spark?  Your eyes met again as she caught you staring your gaze moving back to the screen to hide your blush your fingers hovering over the keyboard as if you would have actually had something to write. From the corner of your eye you saw her smile to herself as she too went back to the pages of Middlemarch her finger marking the spot where she had left off. You wanted closer to her you wanted to make physical contact with her more than you wanted anything else at the moment. You needed things to move forward for something to happen because you couldn’t take the tension any longer those gorgeous green eyes returning to your frame with the same frequency as yours went to hers.  “Can I see what you’ve got so far?” She asked quietly a moment later the pining starting to get a bit too obvious her voice nothing but a whisper in the silent library. You nodded your head her hands moving to the laptop those cool fingers brushing over your own as she brought the device in front of her to get a better look. She tried not to allow a smirk of amusement to take over her features as she finally saw just what you had managed to get done in the span of ninety minutes. Your work was slow incredibly so but she was willing to forgive you since she had a feeling that the reason for it wasn’t your incompetence but rather her presence that to her pleasure seemed to have quite an effect on you. “Mind if I add something?”  “No not at all. Floor is all yours.” You chuckled softly watching with great curiosity as she pulled back her sleeves a bit to get them out of the way your eyes devouring her veiny hands that you had previously overlooked due to the bruising on her knuckles. Her pale hands and forearms were just as toned and defined as the rest of her body green and blue veins pushing visibly through her fair complexion. She started typing away her fingers flying over the keys so fast you could barely process their coordinated and skilled movement. You had always been attracted by hands and forearms but when you saw the way her muscles rippled beneath her skin with each movement of her hands she gave it a whole different meaning. You would do anything to hold those strong and capable hands in your own to feel them grip your hips and waist you would do anything but actually take a leap of faith and grab her hand.  Natasha finished off your paragraph continuing your argument from a perspective you had discussed together. You were almost jealous of how beautifully the words flowed into the document her fingers forming full intellectual sentences with little-to-no time spent thinking of their structure. It was like she was pouring out her thoughts onto the white screen of your laptop. “I’m gonna write down the structure for you. It’ll be easier to follow along and keep up with the story.” The clicking sound of the keyboard seized those round eyes turning to you as you simply nodded your head.  “I should probably read that one chapter you mentioned with the codicil and stuff” you reasoned partly to yourself but seeking for Natasha’s validation.  “Yeah it could definitely give you a clearer picture on the argument you’re trying to make.” She typed a couple more sentences in French lines structuring your essay. You were more than thankful for her assistance surprised to find yourself genuinely comfortable receiving help instead of feeling threatened for having someone meddling with your work. It was a bigger issue at times but not an issue around her.  “Ugh and I still need to find the passages to quote too” you groaned suddenly leaning back into the uncomfortable chair you occupied bringing your hands to your face in exhaustion. You were hungry and tired your feet and hands getting colder by the minute in the drafty old building. You wanted to let go of the essay find something else to think about to give your brain a much-needed break from analyzing prose. You wanted to escape the stress of the nearing midterms that would require you to put extra effort into your schoolwork that you were already neglecting to begin with. You wanted a moment of peace a day where you didn’t have a list of tasks to complete.  “How many did you need?”  “Three is the minimum but you don’t have to look for them. You’ve already done half the assignment” you said jokingly but it was far too close to reality. She huffed out a small chuckle studying your tired face with a look of empathy on her features her head tilting to the side as if in compassion. She remained quiet for a moment clearly in thought before she spoke.  “We should take a break go for lunch get some fresh air. The deadline is next week right? You don’t have to cram it all in one sitting. You can let the thoughts and arguments marinate for a while. I’m sure a bite of something would help you get your brain going again.” She spoke softly her gentle tentativeness shining through like a beacon. She was oddly caring something that you rarely saw in the people around you. It felt strange. Her attention didn’t come off as patronizing or belittling but rather supportive. She was like a pillar for you to lean on and it was all her doing her own volition. You weren’t begging for her to take care of you you weren’t even asking for it yet she had no problem being her assertive caring self.  “I’d love that.” You didn’t know why you let her sweep you off your feet time and time again when you knew better than to trust people to trust strangers. You knew that you shouldn’t ever lean on anybody if you wanted to avoid getting hurt avoid betrayal and disappointment. But she was right there in front of you with those soft angelic features and a genuine smile and you were so lonely so lonely that your heart ached from the sole thought of having someone again. So you gave in to your desires and let go of everything that you were used to blindly diving right into the deep end of love because there was nothing else you could have done not when every morsel of your being was given what it needed.  You walked through the sunny streets of New York City the cold biting your cheeks as the crisp October air numbed up your fingertips. The sun was relatively high in the sky and shone brightly giving the city a warm golden glow the vibrant-colored leaves reminding you of why you loved fall so dearly the surrounding trees glowing like flames of a campfire. You hugged yourself tightly to warm yourself up as you crossed the road to Cornelia Street walking along it until you reached Bleecker Street your nose locating your favorite pizza place before your eyes found the sign that read John’s Pizzeria.  “This is it?” Natasha asked for confirmation earning a small nod from you.  “I swear the pizza is so good. It’s the best pizza I’ve ever had. It’s a foolproof choice. I come here too often. I think the workers recognize me” you explained in mild amusement Natasha yanking the front door open for you her hand guiding you inside the cozy and crowded restaurant.  “It better be. I’m starving.”  As much as her company excited and thrilled you there was a part of you that felt uneasy. Something didn’t add up because you were actually getting along with someone you actually found yourself comfortable in someone else’s company in a way that wasn’t familiar to you and by the time you received your orders your alarm bells were going off. Things were advancing too quickly too naturally. Why did you feel so connected to this woman after just two days? Why did it feel so easy so right? You couldn’t fall in love you couldn’t. It required you to be vulnerable open to love and happiness open to the possibility of getting hurt again open to giving another person the control to rip your life into shreds if they so wished.  You were just going to be friends. It was decided it was official. You were just going to be friends because anything more than that scared the living daylights out of you. You would just have to suck it up and ignore the herd of butterflies that swarmed inside you every time she so much as glanced your way. You were going to stay strong and ignore your crush. You had done it once before no matter how poorly at least you had done it but your plan failed the second you looked up at her from the cheesiness of your plate to see her take a bite of a huge slice of pepperoni pizza the mozzarella stretching and stretching until she let out an awkward laugh using her hand to get rid of the long string of cheese. Her pink cheeks gave her a slight glow accentuating the hypnotic green of her irises her perfectly carved nose matching the hue of her cheeks. You couldn’t resist her you couldn’t fight the feeling no matter how much you would have wanted to the weight of an uncertain future lifting off your heart as you watched her lap up the rope of cheese off her chin before reaching for a napkin to wipe her mouth with those full lips a deeper shade than you had ever witnessed on her. It didn’t matter that you didn’t know what the future held it didn’t matter if she broke your heart in two and stomped on it with those heeled boots of hers because that moment was enough to make up for it the comfort and solace you felt were enough to make up for it.  The small break was far from short your stay at the restaurant stretching like a warm piece of cheese that wouldn’t snap no matter what. You stayed for so long that both of you ended up finishing off your plates after complaining that you were too full on multiple occasions but somehow as the conversation flowed and the irresistible pizza sat in front of you on the table it slowly disappeared in small bite-sized pieces that you tore off as a way to keep your hands busy. By the time you exited the restaurant the sun was low in the sky shining right into your eyes on its way to hide behind the horizon. It was somehow even colder outside your warm breath forming a faint cloud of vapor in the air that faded away instantly but you felt warm all over as you two made your way back to campus taking a detour around Washington Square Park to get a better look at the effects of the season on the surrounding nature wishing to find an excuse to prolong your non-official date. You were walking silently beneath a gorgeous arch formed by the canopy of trees a bit of sunlight peeking through the warm colors of the leaves when her hand brushed against yours.  You glanced at her as if to see if she would react her head turning your way. You expected to feel nervous waiting for that feeling of dizziness to take over once again but it didn’t. All you felt was calm determination. You wanted to hold her hand. It couldn’t have been any more obvious so you reached your freezing fingers for hers tentatively grasping her bare hand into your own noting that she possessed a bit more warmth than you did. Your steps slowed down both of you coming to a halt as if to process the change that had taken place on the pathway littered with brown and orange leaves. Natasha looked away her lips stretching into a reserved smirk that was the result of an attempt to hide it. Your cheeks flushed warm as if to fight against the relentless cold air that was slowly starting to sting the delicate skin of your face. You gave her hand a squeeze pleased to receive one in return. She held your hand with purpose with confidence your heart fluttering weakly. She wasn’t just keeping your hand limply in hers but actually holding it leaving no room for obscurity regarding her willingness to make contact with you reminding you of her words from the night before. She wouldn’t hold just anyone’s hand.  With a small smile adorning your lips you took a step forward to continue your way back to campus but to your surprise she didn’t move her arm reaching forward like a stretching spring until it held you back bringing you face to face with her in a single firm tug. You looked up at her questioningly expecting her to say something to explain herself. Maybe she wanted to go a different route or suggest getting coffees or maybe it was time for her to go home. As if panicked by the mere thought you started analyzing her face as an automatic habit that was solely the result of your artistic nature your eyes taking in the fiery red of her hair that was enhanced by the setting sun behind her. You knew what shades of paint you would have used to mix the hue of orange you knew where you would have placed the warm highlights to make the painting in your imagination glow in the most captivating way. You noted the leaves on the trees behind and above her deeming that the specific shade of orange deviated from her hair. It fell flat beside her auburn locks. You could almost feel in your hand how you would have held a brush in it how you would have carefully placed the lights and shadows of her pale face her cheeks and nose tainted pink from the cold. You knew just how much ultramarine you would have needed to add into the mixture of titanium white and carmine to mute down the color to match her complexion. You saw the hint of lemon yellow that you would have needed to maintain the warmth of the sensitive hue. It was all right there for you the possibility of the most perfect portrait study the naturally flawed picture of feminine beauty staring back at you.  She didn’t smile her lips parting the slightest bit as she looked at you drawing your attention to their shape and size your trained eye measuring every curve and arch. She leaned closer to you her gaze trailing down your features to your mouth her hand remaining in yours as she erased the small gap between you. She kissed you tenderly showing her vulnerable and tentative side to you for the first time her lips pressing over yours the cold tip of her nose brushing against your cheek. Your eyes fluttered shut to savor the feel of her mouth however gentle and light it might have been. You weren’t guaranteed another chance another kiss so you allowed your mind to shut off for just a moment as you held your lips pressed up against hers. The kiss was objectively very tame shy even your lips remaining together for mere seconds but the intimacy of the almost child-like innocence of the kiss made your head spin. It felt so pure so genuine so vulnerable that it made you shiver. You felt like she had undressed you from clothing from all your defenses. There was nothing protecting your poor heart that had been clawed raw by the past. She had full access to your weeping soul and she was treating it with nothing but care.  Natasha pulled back first her widened pale eyes meeting yours as if she couldn’t quite believe she had done it a sense of awe pushing through to you. There was a small twitch in her brow when you let go of her hand as if she feared letting go of you feared upsetting you but her expression morphed into one of relief when your arms slid over her waist to bring you both even closer to one another. You rose onto your tiptoes bringing your mouth back on hers putting more weight behind the act your body seeking for support from her to get you through the intensity of your emotions. It was so cold outside so cold that you could barely feel your lips anymore but it didn’t matter your numb arms squeezing her closer as you molded your mouth over hers. The contact was an imitation of the first kiss slowly developing into something more as she parted her lips enough to fit your bottom one between hers her tongue remaining on the very edge of her lower lip softly caressing you with its velvety warmth every time you kissed as if providing you a promise of what was to come. Her gentle breath warmed your skin the wind ruffling her hair the auburn curls tickling your cheeks. You pulled back just enough to see her to look her in the eyes to make sure it was her that you were kissing that those pale green eyes were looking at you that those rosy lips were kissing you. She smiled at you unable to contain it the expression wearing off on you when you pressed your mouth on hers again her teeth scraping lightly against your lips as you kissed her smile. Her hands stroked over the material of your coat going up your biceps to find your face her ice-cold fingers cupping your cheeks. She deepened the kiss a delicate moan falling from your lips the sound going through Natasha like a bolt of lightning.  She took control slowly her tongue growing more dominant as her grip on you tightened. You weren’t just kissing but you were being kissed kissed in a way that left no room for debate on who was in charge. Your body melted into hers searching for her strong frame for you to lean on. You craved her steadfast body her energy yearning to let go of the harsh grip you had kept on yourself for months on end. You just wanted to be. You wanted to sink inside her where you would be safe and sound where your heart could rest. You kissed her harder tried to fight the position she had claimed for herself in your life for one last time but she was unyielding those full lips far too soft far too irresistible. She was everything you wanted.  You were forced to pull away when your lungs started to ache your chest heaving with each intake of breath as you looked up at her mirth sparkling in your eyes. There was no denying that the experience was nothing short of thrilling. You felt like your body was buzzing the warmth in your chest gliding down your spine pooling in your lower abdomen with such intensity you almost felt mortified eternally thankful that she had no way of witnessing it. You both smiled at each other her thumbs brushing over the cold skin of your face her slight frown letting you know that she wanted you inside somewhere warm. She leaned closer once more pecking your lips softly as her left hand found your right one to hold her hand remaining snugly linked with yours as you continued your walk in the sea of rimy leaves their quiet rustle and crunch filling in the blissful silence between you.,2024-10-27 21:41:35 GMT

72,ao3,['commenting'  'on comments'],ginnyw-potter,Commenting etiquette  Yes we do need to talk about it. And I’m not talking about the hateful comments there are mean people everywhere. I’m talking about people who enjoy the fic but don’t seem to get that across entirely.   I frequently hear other writers get so discouraged by unmindful comments and it’s something I’ve experienced too.  And I absolutely do not want to get people scared to comment because the majority of comments are good and wonderful I just hope a few do’s and don&#x27;ts help everyone along.   You do not know the writer and the writer doesn’t know you Most of the time you do not have any rapport going with the writer or very little unless you are besties who are in each other’s PMs.  What that means  It is really difficult to guess people’s tone and intentions from a few words in a comment box especially if they’re dubious. So don’t make them dubious! It’s so easy to say I like…. I enjoyed… Put it in there please (more tips below) You don’t know what people are going through There can be about 700 reasons a writer doesn’t update… maybe they don’t feel like it maybe life got in the way sometimes people go an have babies or their house burns down! The dreaded AO3 curse! So be kind always. You are getting free words. Writers do not owe you an update when you want no matter what humongous cliff hanger they left you on  It’s so easy to be misunderstood online.  “But I want an update!”   Yeah I get it. you’re excited! But asking for an update is hardly ever going to land well. What you can say instead of ‘When do you update?’ (or other ruder options and double question marks often come across as rude. leave them at home) is &#x27;I am eagerly awaiting an update!’  You’re still letting them know you’re filled with excitement for an update but you’re not demanding it.  Important note: If you say this please let it not be the only thing you write. Say a little more as to why. If you want an update you surely know why.   … So how do you write a good comment?   &lt;!-- more --&gt; (Obviously there are a lot of ways to write great comments but here are a few pointers for people who get anxious leaving a comment.)  Say you are enjoying the fic or the chapter. it’s so easy. This is the bare minimum if you comment in my humble opinion I love this fic This chapter was amazing This fic lives in my head rent-free!  Point out things you liked or tell what the fic did with your emotions I really loved it when x went to x and confessed their love I was at the edge of my seat the whole time! Crying over this fic it’s so perfectly angsty  You can express sentiment about the further story but do it well I can’t wait to find out about x I will be wondering about x until next update I am so entranced I am so excited to find out more about x  When you update I’m going to be first in line to read!  Any other sentiments a thank you note or the likes are nice or leave more kudos by pasting in the more kudos images (it’s so easy and posts tend to have instructions) link here  Example of a good comment:   I love this fic so much I have literally not stopped reading until I was caught up When she was almost run over by the bus my heart stopped and I was so relieved when she made it!  I loved the bit where he helps her clean up the tea spill so sweet and tender. I wonder how she’s going to explain that tea stain to her evil stepmother….  Thank you so much for this update!   You can also install the floating AO3 box and I love to use it to already comment on particular things I liked as I go so I don’t forget and it easily let’s you copy-paste bits into the comment box so you can point out exactly what you liked about it.   A lot of people have started treating fics as something to consume and don’t see the writer behind it and it’s so sad to see people recommend people to only read finished fics that don’t comment or only to ask when they are getting more words. (I know if you’ve read this far you’re likely not one of those.)   And then they’re surprised their favourite author stopped posting when that author may think their fic isn’t liked by you (because you never took the time to say) or they lose the enjoyment of posting because people just always simply demand more more and more.   In summary be kind to your writer. they’re a whole person who is putting wonderful stories out for you for free. they likely have a day job or school to get to and a 100 worries you know nothing about. I’m not the comment police I can’t tell you what to comment but I just hope you take into consideration how your comment is going to be received by the writer on the other side.,2024-10-27 21:35:25 GMT

He sipped at mulled wine while his hand idly stroked a handmade sweater that Morena had gifted him folded neatly on his lap.  When she had first handed him the package wrapped in brown paper - secured neatly with twine and a sprig of lavender tucked under the bow - he was puzzled. She tossed a similar one to Gale assuring the other guests they would receive theirs later on.  His fingers pulled at the rough string. He tried to contain his eagerness while tearing open the paper but it must have slipped because Gale chuckled beside him watching with his own excitement glistening in his warm eyes.  Astarion gasped as he lifted the sweater. It was beautiful maroon crafted in a chunky knit fashion. The wool was soft against his face as he cuddled into it smelling faintly of Morena’s perfume. He held it away from him and stared in wonder.  “I hope it’s alright. Consider it an early Christmas present” Morena said with a smile.  “It…It’s more than alright.” He felt the beginnings of tears in his eyes. He cleared his throat as Gale’s arm came around him. “Thank you so very much.”  His ears drowned out the noise of Gale opening his gift. He continued to look over the sweater admiring every loop every strand every bit of care Morena Dekarios had poured into it for him. He had never been given a handmade gift before Gale. Now he proudly owned two the vase Gale had crafted and a wool sweater from the mother of the man he loved. Both meant more to him than any expensive bauble or trinket money could buy.

The movie played in the background but his undivided attention was consumed by the presence of the small woman nestled in his lap. He knew she was trying to ignore the effect he had on her but her small shivers and the rapid pulse of her heartbeat betrayed her.  He chuckled low the sound vibrating against her back. His hands continued their gentle caresses moving from her hip to her thigh and back up again his touch a mix of tenderness and possessiveness. Lula glanced back at Valentino “no shenanigans just sitting” a firm reminder of their agreement.  “I’ll behave I promise” he said his voice oozing with mock innocence. His hands however continued their gentle caresses tracing soft patterns on her thigh. She gave an unamused ‘hm’ and turned her attention back to the screen.

Hope you enjoy!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; The Man Cave was alive with activity for the first time in years. Jasper Piper and Charlotte were all there. Each was able to take off their last few weeks of classes making up family emergencies. They were to take their finals online.  Finals however were the last things on their mind. They paced around talking amongst each other. They did whatever they could. Charlotte was on a tablet while Piper sat with Captain Man. Jasper accessed Schwoz by wiring up Christopher.  “Do you understand the plan?” Charlotte asked typing on her tablet.  “I-I think so” Christopher said as he licked his lips. This was not how he was expecting his morning to go. The day after he told Captain Man everything he received a call from the man himself. He had no idea how he got his number but nonetheless he received the call telling him to go to a random street. Once he was there he was… kidnapped. He was pretty sure that he was kidnapped and brought to the Man Cave. Everyone instantly started to talk to him telling him the plan. Each person had a part as if it was planned out.  From what he understood they wanted him to go back to Extra Space Storage and tell Drex that he was interested in joining him. While there he would be wearing special glasses with a camera in between the eyes. This would allow for the group here to get a layout of the basement and create a rescue plan.  When he pointed out that this plan could take a while Captain Man said “Tell me about it.” while the youngest girl- Piper he thinks her name was- said that she did not care how long it took. They were going to get Kid Danger back one way or the other. They would try this way first.  They could always go to plan B which apparently was a raid.  “You either know or you don’t” Captain Man said sternly.  “I know. I know the plan” Christopher said injecting as much confidence in his voice as he could. It was not convincing enough.  Captain Man shook his head. “I don’t know.”  “C’mon R- Captain Man” the young man stammered. Jasper. That was his name. It reminded Christopher of Casper.  “He’s the only option we have right now” Charlotte said walking over to him. “Drex knows all of us” she indicated to everyone in the room. “And Christopher already has an in.”  Captain Man stood marching over toward. He pointed toward his chest “You cannot give any indication that you are working with us. Drex is dangerous and smart. He will suspect something if you slip once.”  Christopher nodded his understanding. “I got it. No crying no flinching. None of that.”  Ray still hated it. As angry as he could be with Christopher he was just a kid no older than the other kids here. He did not ask for this he just stumbled upon it. He was currently going above what anyone could expect of him. Charlotte was right however. He was their only in. The only safe way that they could get Henry back. They needed to get Henry back as safe and sound as possible.  So Captain Man nodded. “Good” he waved him off “now go. You know what to do.”  …  Henry did not know how long he was in his room for. He was fed twice so he knew that it was at least two days. Two days with nothing to do but wait and sit in his pain was not abnormal.  Henry spent that time daydreaming. He fantasized about somewhere safe. Someplace where he was surrounded by people who liked him and did not hurt him. Dad was there. Dad never hurt him. He still hung out around the edges of the fantasy. Just on the outskirts while he watched movies with his friends or talked to them.  Henry was rudely taken out of his fantasy when his door slammed open. Henry flinched looking up to see Drex. The goggles and mask dangled from his normal hand casually.  “Hello Sir” Henry whispered bowing his head the way he was supposed to.  “Good morning Sweetheart” Drex said gently. He walked over to Henry grabbing his cheek and rubbing his thumb on his cheekbones. Henry tensed but did not dare back away. He was not allowed to. He had learned very quickly that a nice touch could turn painful especially when he did something bad.  He knew the rules. He was supposed to obey. No matter what. He was not allowed to do anything before he received permission. That included eating moving or speaking. He was to clean anything he was told to and take any beating anyone wanted to give him.  Drex removed his hand standing to his full height. Despite only being a couple of inches taller than him Henry always felt so small. Drex was a giant and he was a simple broonie. Only he was not given food in return for his efforts.  Drex snapped in his face. Henry’s head snapped up to look at Drex’s face. He was still smiling. Henry sighed in relief and waited for his next direction.  “So stuck in your own head hu?” Drex asked.  Drex wanted an answer. What answer Henry was not sure. So he said “Sorry Sir.” He was still quiet. He was not allowed to be loud. Drex did not like it.  “No more of that daydreaming” Drex ordered. “Too stupid for all that anyway.”  Henry nodded though he did not know if he agreed. He was supposed to agree with everything that Drex said. Sometimes he did not. He would never let Drex know that.  “Stand” Drex ordered shortly.  Henry instantly listened but he was slower than he normally was. He had not moved much in a couple of days. He was stiff. Drex did not care. Never did. All that mattered was that he was too slow.  Drex pushed him down harshly onto the mattress. A gasp of pain escaped him as his head bounced off the wall. Without thinking he rubbed the back of his head. Tears filled his eyes that he did not allow to drop. If he cried over this Drex would just make everything worse.  Drex slapped his hand away from his head with his clawed hand causing pain to blister as Drex scratched him. Drex then felt the back of his head with a hum. He pressed down on a particularly tender spot. Henry hissed softly but did not protest any further.  “You’ll be alright” Drex dismissed. This time he grabbed the top of his right arm and forced him up to his feet. Henry knew better than to try and fight. Drex was already angry. No need to make him anymore.  Once he was on his feet Drex said “Good was that so hard?  Henry shook his head with a gulp hoping that he was doing the right thing.  “Now we’re going to have a fun day” Drex said.  A shiver ran through Henry’s spine. A “fun day” was never fun for him. He would be hurt. A lot. Henry took a shaky breath but he did not let himself show his fear. That would just make everything so much worse.  “I’m going to put this on you” Drex explained slowly as if he was talking to a small child. He shook the goggles. He would not be allowed to see today. That was okay. Henry did not like to see all the people Drex had with him. They were scary. Hearing them was bad enough. They always laughed at him.  “I don’t want to have to put your mask on but I will if I have to” Drex said once again patting his face. “I want to hear you scream pretty.”  “Yes Sir” Henry said shakily.  Henry did not fight the goggles. He never did. Drex tightened the strap around his head too tight. It was uncomfortable and he would likely have a headache by the time they were done. Those were the least of his worries however. He was going to be hurt badly today.  ‘Just take it’ Henry thought to himself. ‘Don’t try to protect yourself. That will just make everything so much worse.’  “Good” Drex said as if he could read his thoughts. He grabbed the nape of his neck with his clawed hand. Henry could feel warm blood trickle down his back. He did not react. Could not react as his mind race with the possibilities of what could happen.  “Now walk.”  …  Henry was taken over one hundred steps to the left. Henry’s stomach dropped. He knew what was going to happen now. Drex explained that sometimes his goons would get stressed. A punching bag was the perfect way to get stress out.  He was the punching bag.  Henry heard his heartbeat in his ears as his breathing became labored. He did not want to. He really really did not want to.  He did not realize that he was shaking his head until Drex pulled his hair forcing his head back. “You do not get to say no. That’s the first lesson you learned. Remember?”  Henry nodded although he did not remember. It was like the rules were implanted in his mind at some point. He knew them but he did not remember how he knew them. Maybe that was for the best.  Drex let go of his hair and they continued to walk twenty more steps. A squeaky door was opened and left open. Ten more steps. The footsteps echoed. The room was empty.  “Hold your arms up” Drex ordered.  Henry instantly listened. He did not want another correction. Freezing cuffs were wrapped around his wrists and ankles. He was not going anywhere. Just want Drex wanted.  Suddenly there was a knock at the door.  “Drex there is someone here for you” a female voice said. Dahlia. She was Drex’s favorite so she got away with interrupting him.  “Who?”  “That guy- Christopher I think.”  “Tell him I’ll be right there” Drex said. There was a pleased tone about his voice. Heels clicked on the ground as Dahlia walked away.  “You wait right here” Drex said patting his cheek. “I’m sure our new friend will enjoy this.”  ‘Great’ Henry thought to himself as he heard Drex’s footsteps walk away. ‘A new friend.’,2024-10-27 22:41:06 GMT

He is not upset about the paperwork he knows everyone will have to do it but Megan and the Martian detective are on Mars on personal business and can’t help. He asks Red Tornado for a copy and it’s a surprise for Conner a name that proudly appears on the protagonist only one.   1. Bruce Wayne it’s interesting in retrospect… Conner’s never met the man in his life but the genemorphs showed him what he looked like but what’s a Gotham City billionaire’s name elegantly spelled after his father doing on his certificate?  Conner definitely didn’t have the urge to go knock on his door and ask what was going on because he first asked Batman who awkwardly explained that he was a good friend who was willing to help if the situation warranted it… yeah it was definitely because of that answer that he crossed the country and knocked on his door. The fact that he ended up running across the rooftops of Gotham a couple of months later was a curious and happy ending.  2. Clarence Charles Batson more than confused by a totally strange name Conner feels the need to use the central computer of Mount Justice and the results disturb him missing they don’t help him too much… Married archaeologist two children lost five years ago… the photo speaks for itself he’s practically Captain Marvel but with a terrible disguise. When he asks about the certificate the captain only manages to smile begins to tell him an interesting story about a magician and a moral about not following unknown voices to abandoned subway stations. After an afternoon of flying he ends up adding that he shouldn’t worry since they have the same chin. Conner doesn’t feel the urge to wear tights yet but he stamps a lightning bolt on his favorite jacket and is learning some magic from his magical father.  3. Lex Luthor yes is in front of Conner signing his birth certificate… Conner takes it as soon as he finishes and leaves his office with the same energy and good humor that characterizes him. He is certainly not upset because Clark has just spit in his face that he is not his father it was not because he tore up the certificate where his name was written a paper he had not seen before or because he was not allowed to explain himself… He is upset because I sent him to find the person who sent him to clone. And from there he left he intended to get the signature of PAUL WESTFIELD CEO of Cadmus but he discovered that he had another biological father who he did not hesitate to visit in the heat of the moment… the latter blessed by the clone’s situation and his motivation did not take long to make it official. Conner never uses the certificate but keeps it in his room waiting for the day when Clark resumes this one-sided discussion.  4.Guy Gardner Conner has to ask Robin to hack into him to find out who he is because his information is encoded in the systems. He turns out to be the last Green Lantern to join the Justice League and someone very difficult to locate for a simple chat. A mini alien invasion and an attack in Brussels are necessary for Conner to be able to talk to him. Surprisingly the Lantern recognizes him and greets him asking him how he’s been doing at school. A totally inappropriate image of the man for those who knew him or read reports about him. He easily manages to clarify that he was present the day they discussed who would sign the paper he spit out that he knew gang members or imbeciles with more balls to sign for a baby that they weren’t even sure if it was theirs. He becomes Conner’s favorite superhero when he asks him - Do you want to go hit something boy? - Conner surprisingly does. Guy leaves again for space shortly after but not before giving him an interspace communicator to keep in touch and a six pack of beer. Conner can’t drink legally and biologically his body can’t get drunk his gift is unbecoming but the gesture of spoiling a super-powered teenager makes him feel pretty good. Conner ends up keeping them in his room with some appreciation. He gets a lantern tattoo a year later.  ……….

Joel hands her one already dead or most of the way there from exhaustion but its eyes still gleam clear and mercurial in the pale light. It’s been a long time since she’s had to fight any aversion to handling a dead animal so it catches her off guard when her stomach lurches and she quickly hands the trout to Miguel sinking her teeth deep into her lip. She feels a little heat rise in her cheeks when the corner of his mouth twitches in a smile and he turns away from her to gut it. Ellie fixes her gaze on the lake shore attempting to quell the reverberant surges of nausea with slow breaths.   Much to her chagrin It’s a losing battle. Saliva pools thickly under her tongue and each breath is heavy in her lungs as she tries to hold off long enough to get off the ice. Finally Joel packs up the gear and by the time they reach solid ground her jaw is aching from keeping it clenched and Joel and Miguel’s voices are both muffled by the ringing in her ears. Fighting the sudden childish urge to cry she turns abruptly to Joel.  “I gotta pee” she says attempting to keep the edge of desperation out of her voice and salvage some shred of dignity before she pukes last night’s dinner at his feet.  “Can you wait until we’re back?” he asks and she shakes her head vehemently already tasting the bile in the back of her throat.   He presses his lips in a thin line scanning the treeline behind her warily but finally mercifully he nods. “Stay close ” he emphasizes.  She nearly bolts for the trees adrenaline already surging in her veins. She hates the feeling of being sick and the thrum of anxiety in her chest does nothing to help quell the nausea as she forces herself to slow down to maintain an awareness of her surroundings.  It’s quiet all around not even a breeze to stir the branches. She steps carefully through the underbrush and the snow which obscures it pushing deeper into the umbra of the forest.   Normally she would only go a few paces in but Miguel and Joel are lingering close to the treeline backs turned and she doesn’t want them to hear. She blinks back a wash of tears in earnest now born not of discomfort in particular but some heady mixture of exhaustion and dismay. Hopefully this is just something she ate and not truly the price she’s forced to pay for a modicum of exertion. Either way she better get it out of her system now because there’s no way Joel’s gonna let this one slide if he finds out. She takes half a second more to scan her surroundings as the inevitable looms and then she doubles over and empties her stomach in wrenching heaves.  She hangs her head wincing at the way the muscles beneath her ribs spasm and ache. It doesn’t hurt like something’s wrong she’s pretty sure but it still hurts . Setting her shoulder against the narrow trunk of an aspen she waits for her treacherous stomach to decide if it’s done and braces against a wave of dizziness that catches her broadside.  “Ellie?” Joel’s voice sounds distant beneath the rising hum.  “I’m fine” she calls out hoarsely. Totally fucking fine.  She lifts her head blinking as the world comes back into focus around her only to lock eyes with the ravening gaze of an infected.  Her gun is up and leveled before the scream that tears from her lungs has a chance to echo in the still air. She’s aware of Joel and Miguel’s voices rising the sound of them charging through the brush. Her finger tightens around the trigger but she does not pull. She doesn’t know why she hesitates except that—  It makes no move towards her. In fact the runner raises its hands slowly as if in surrender.   &amp;&amp;&amp;  header creds:  @lauramakabresku | @omenalehto | @lauramakabreskuriver view valley ranch hbo | seeking our someday | @perennialdoll247,2024-10-28 00:48:51 GMT

I’ve archived both asks/answers on AO3 and I’ve also summarized some Tag Search info/tips here (see below the cut).   First the AO3 links:  How to find the biggest ships on AO3 or for a given AO3 fandom. In which I start out trying to help someone debug a Transformers ship search weirdness but I end up giving (hopefully) more generally helpful info/advice on finding the biggest ships. Contains notes on the limitations/quirks of Tag Search (as of Oct 2024).  Top AO3 characters and ships missing from my Jan 2024 analysis.  An eagle-eyed reader noticed that some character tags (including Wanda Maximoff) were tags missing from last January’s analysis of biggest fandoms characters and ships. (Most of the missing tags were not missing from the graphs but from further down in the longer lists I provided – including Wanda.) Here I share data about the missing character (and ship!) tags along with some methodology notes about how this happened.  Next my AO3 Tag Search methodology summary/tips:  &lt;!-- more --&gt; AO3 Tag Search lets you sort tags by number of uses which means you can quickly find the most common tags. It didn’t always work that way; it used to just let you sort tags alphabetically and by date created which was a lot less useful for fandom stats.  This is awesome because you can find the most common tags within a particular fandom OR across all of AO3. You can limit it to any of the following types of tags: Fandom Character Relationship Freeform (a.k.a. “Additional tags”) or look at all tags combined. This means that I can do a more complete job with my yearly “biggest fandoms characters and ships” roundups than I used to be able to do. (For more explanation see the first link below.) However Tag Search has some quirks.  For one thing it seems that the totals shown in Tag Search includes AO3 bookmark tags when counting how often a tag was used. This means some of the most common tags are things like “To Read”. Unpublished drafts also get counted in the total numbers for tags. All of this means that some tags may appear more popular in Tag Search than they do in the main AO3 search results (Work Search) or in the Sort &amp; Filter sidebar.  I believe Tag Search also doesn’t take tag wrangling into account. This means that some tags will appear much less popular in Tag Search than in the main AO3 search (e.g. a tag with lots of popular subtags doesn’t have all those subtags included when listed in Tag Search – Tag Search only counts exact uses). It also means that some characters/ships might be missing when you’re finding the biggest ships/characters in a given fandom if the characters/ships aren’t all wrangled under all the relevant fandoms. See the Transformers example in the tutorial below for further explanation of how this happens and how to solve for it. One consequence of all this is that the numbers shown in the Tag Search results are probably not what you expect. Not if what you want is the number of times authors have used the tag (i.e. excluding use in boomarks) – and especially not if you want tag wrangling into account.  You have to click on each tag listed in the Tag Search results and then go to the tag’s Works page to see the number that you may expect to see. Hope this helps others out there gathering AO3 data!,2024-10-28 00:28:45 GMT

Joel hands her one already dead or most of the way there from exhaustion but its eyes still gleam clear and mercurial in the pale light. It’s been a long time since she’s had to fight any aversion to handling a dead animal so it catches her off guard when her stomach lurches and she quickly hands the trout to Miguel sinking her teeth deep into her lip. She feels a little heat rise in her cheeks when the corner of his mouth twitches in a smile and he turns away from her to gut it. Ellie fixes her gaze on the lake shore attempting to quell the reverberant surges of nausea with slow breaths.   Much to her chagrin It’s a losing battle. Saliva pools thickly under her tongue and each breath is heavy in her lungs as she tries to hold off long enough to get off the ice. Finally Joel packs up the gear and by the time they reach solid ground her jaw is aching from keeping it clenched and Joel and Miguel’s voices are both muffled by the ringing in her ears. Fighting the sudden childish urge to cry she turns abruptly to Joel.  “I gotta pee” she says attempting to keep the edge of desperation out of her voice and salvage some shred of dignity before she pukes last night’s dinner at his feet.  “Can you wait until we’re back?” he asks and she shakes her head vehemently already tasting the bile in the back of her throat.   He presses his lips in a thin line scanning the treeline behind her warily but finally mercifully he nods. “Stay close ” he emphasizes.  She nearly bolts for the trees adrenaline already surging in her veins. She hates the feeling of being sick and the thrum of anxiety in her chest does nothing to help quell the nausea as she forces herself to slow down to maintain an awareness of her surroundings.  It’s quiet all around not even a breeze to stir the branches. She steps carefully through the underbrush and the snow which obscures it pushing deeper into the umbra of the forest.   Normally she would only go a few paces in but Miguel and Joel are lingering close to the treeline backs turned and she doesn’t want them to hear. She blinks back a wash of tears in earnest now born not of discomfort in particular but some heady mixture of exhaustion and dismay. Hopefully this is just something she ate and not truly the price she’s forced to pay for a modicum of exertion. Either way she better get it out of her system now because there’s no way Joel’s gonna let this one slide if he finds out. She takes half a second more to scan her surroundings as the inevitable looms and then she doubles over and empties her stomach in wrenching heaves.  She hangs her head wincing at the way the muscles beneath her ribs spasm and ache. It doesn’t hurt like something’s wrong she’s pretty sure but it still hurts . Setting her shoulder against the narrow trunk of an aspen she waits for her treacherous stomach to decide if it’s done and braces against a wave of dizziness that catches her broadside.  “Ellie?” Joel’s voice sounds distant beneath the rising hum.  “I’m fine” she calls out hoarsely. Totally fucking fine.  She lifts her head blinking as the world comes back into focus around her only to lock eyes with the ravening gaze of an infected.  Her gun is up and leveled before the scream that tears from her lungs has a chance to echo in the still air. She’s aware of Joel and Miguel’s voices rising the sound of them charging through the brush. Her finger tightens around the trigger but she does not pull. She doesn’t know why she hesitates except that—  It makes no move towards her. In fact the runner raises its hands slowly as if in surrender.   &amp;&amp;&amp;  header creds:  @lauramakabresku | @omenalehto | @lauramakabreskuriver view valley ranch hbo | seeking our someday | @perennialdoll247,2024-10-28 00:48:51 GMT

It wasn’t that he had never thought of them before generally but now he was thinking about them especially in regards to Buck.  And though Buck didn’t bring it up again he seemed to have made it his mission to remind Eddie of the offer in other ways.

When he consumes it he sees pieces of their life the images flickering through his mind like an old Hollywood reel. It’s all there vivid and dramatic like he’s watching a movie play out seeing memories he’ll never live but somehow understands. And in those moments he’s more than just a hollow shell more than just hungry. In those moments he feels something close to life again.     But what of his life? The thought claws at the edges of his mind as he watches the scene before him. Where did his brain go his own memories? He’s seen it happen countless times—a human captured turned into one of them left with a brain untouched. When the brain remains intact they reawaken staggering into their new existence with a blank slate. But those whose brains are consumed never rise never join the pack. He supposes that somehow no one consumed his brain. Which means his memories are still there buried somewhere in the dusty compartments of his mind locked away.     He tries to remember focusing on the shadowy recesses of his mind as if he could pry them open by sheer will. For a moment there’s only emptiness. But then—something. A flicker of color. A flash of red hair. A laugh bright and carefree breaking through the gray like a sudden spark in the dark. It’s a teenager and she’s laughing with him a genuine belly-deep laugh. He can almost hear the sound feel the warmth that comes with it. And then another image—a different moment the same redhead—now a little older. She’s leaning on his shoulder the two of them sitting somewhere talking in whispers he can’t quite make out.     The images are fleeting slipping away as quickly as they come leaving behind only a hollow ache. They feel important these fragments as if they’re part of a story he’s desperately trying to hold onto. He doesn’t know her name can’t place her face clearly but something about her feels… precious.     Finding home - ancoraimparo_youknowwho - Bridgerton (TV) Archive of Our Own,2024-10-28 03:25:23 GMT

When he consumes it he sees pieces of their life the images flickering through his mind like an old Hollywood reel. It’s all there vivid and dramatic like he’s watching a movie play out seeing memories he’ll never live but somehow understands. And in those moments he’s more than just a hollow shell more than just hungry. In those moments he feels something close to life again.     But what of his life? The thought claws at the edges of his mind as he watches the scene before him. Where did his brain go his own memories? He’s seen it happen countless times—a human captured turned into one of them left with a brain untouched. When the brain remains intact they reawaken staggering into their new existence with a blank slate. But those whose brains are consumed never rise never join the pack. He supposes that somehow no one consumed his brain. Which means his memories are still there buried somewhere in the dusty compartments of his mind locked away.     He tries to remember focusing on the shadowy recesses of his mind as if he could pry them open by sheer will. For a moment there’s only emptiness. But then—something. A flicker of color. A flash of red hair. A laugh bright and carefree breaking through the gray like a sudden spark in the dark. It’s a teenager and she’s laughing with him a genuine belly-deep laugh. He can almost hear the sound feel the warmth that comes with it. And then another image—a different moment the same redhead—now a little older. She’s leaning on his shoulder the two of them sitting somewhere talking in whispers he can’t quite make out.     The images are fleeting slipping away as quickly as they come leaving behind only a hollow ache. They feel important these fragments as if they’re part of a story he’s desperately trying to hold onto. He doesn’t know her name can’t place her face clearly but something about her feels… precious.     Finding home - ancoraimparo_youknowwho - Bridgerton (TV) Archive of Our Own,2024-10-28 03:25:23 GMT

Jaskier sat on the edge of the bed slipping cherry red high heels onto his feet. His legs were donned with white stockings and he wore a red dress that hugged his figure the skirts splayed out around him. He stretched out one leg pointing the toes as he looked up when Geralt entered.   “Whadd&#x27;ya think?” he asked a smile tweaking his lips.   Geralt blinked lost for words.   Jaskier rose to his feet and struck a pose one hand on his hip. “Do I look good enough to beat Yennefer at her own game?”   Eyes roving his husband up and down Geralt licked his lips. “Good enough to slay” he mumbled his voice a little huskier than usual as he drank in his husband’s striking figure. Jaskier’s slender legs looked even longer in those stockings the skirts of the crimson dress falling about him. The dark hair on his chest was bared by the low cut of the dress’s bodice and the thin satin straps left his muscular arms on full display.   Pouting his lips Jaskier stepped towards Geralt taking the witcher’s chin in his hand as he leant close to kiss him. Geralt took hold of Jaskier’s hips drawing their bodies together. The kiss deepened Geralt’s tongue finding Jaskier’s as he poured out his admiration for his husband. With a delightful little mmm of appreciation Jaskier drew back.

We know they exist but we never significantly meet them). And then you write/read a fanfiction where they are a significant character (obviously of the ff author’s own characterisation). Do you tag them/expect to see them tagged as an OC or by their canonical function (e.g. “Blorbo’s unnamed sister”)?

Jaskier dons a sexy new costume for Yennefer’s fancy dress party. Geralt appreciates the outfit in ways he hadn’t been expecting.     Jaskier sat on the edge of the bed slipping cherry red high heels onto his feet. His legs were donned with white stockings and he wore a red dress that hugged his figure the skirts splayed out around him. He stretched out one leg pointing the toes as he looked up when Geralt entered.   “Whadd&#x27;ya think?” he asked a smile tweaking his lips.   Geralt blinked lost for words.   Jaskier rose to his feet and struck a pose one hand on his hip. “Do I look good enough to beat Yennefer at her own game?”   Eyes roving his husband up and down Geralt licked his lips. “Good enough to slay” he mumbled his voice a little huskier than usual as he drank in his husband’s striking figure. Jaskier’s slender legs looked even longer in those stockings the skirts of the crimson dress falling about him. The dark hair on his chest was bared by the low cut of the dress’s bodice and the thin satin straps left his muscular arms on full display.   Pouting his lips Jaskier stepped towards Geralt taking the witcher’s chin in his hand as he leant close to kiss him. Geralt took hold of Jaskier’s hips drawing their bodies together. The kiss deepened Geralt’s tongue finding Jaskier’s as he poured out his admiration for his husband. With a delightful little mmm of appreciation Jaskier drew back. He took Geralt’s hands drew them to his lips to press a gentle kiss to his skin.     Read the full fic on ao3,2024-10-28 08:36:49 GMT

They’re just kissing Lando has kissed many many girls. This is his party. Oscar needs to leave or he will die or he will leave as well as die but he cannot die here not where Lando can see.” “But Charles is for all his antics shockingly sane. And probably straight. Two things Lando increasingly wonders about himself” “He sighs and let his forehead hit the table. Sometimes it’s really all you can do about—situations. Stuff. The horrors.” “To someone like Pierre someone mostly desensitized to beauty by virtue of growing up with Charles” “He falls asleep like that with nothing but a strip of mattress and Lando’s years of practice in denying himself things he wants between them.” “And that’s the thing isn’t it? The ease with which Oscar offers all these things. Like Lando actually isn’t a burden but someone worthy of care and love and attention. Care and love and attention that doesn’t have to be hard earned but can just be given without much complaint” “George Russell was the type of guy who was mud and worms held together by human skin.” ““This sucks let’s go.” He turned and started slinking his way through the crowd towards the front doors. George who couldn’t think of one thing that had changed in the last twelve seconds followed Lando out.” “Oscar wonders if it’s too late to tell Alpine he made a horrible mistake and he can start on Monday.” “He’ll just have to cultivate an imaginary crush on Max fucking Verstappen. Pretend he’s suddenly into cats and a sociopathic level of interest in sim racing.” “Knew it wasn’t Max.“ Then with a quiet snort &quot;His accent. You’re a shit liar. And I’m much prettier than him.” envying the relaxed posture of his rookie teammate in front of him who’s instincts are probably not screaming that he’s about to die because Oscar got a sophisticated brain in the genetic roulette unlike Lando’s defective piece of shit. George realized Lando just wanted to watch someone’s set. George was accidentally out on a social event. Not as he had thought performing the requisite friend support.,2024-10-28 13:20:43 GMT

Dazai reached down and picked up Fyo - Dostoevsky’s arm.   He didn’t know why but Dazai felt emotionless - he wasn’t exactly sad although he would miss being able to have a challenging round of chess. He just felt…empty.   “Congrats Nikolai.” He couldn’t let his smile drop - not yet at least. “You wanted to kill him didn’t you?”   “Yeah I certainly did. Although at the same time I didn’t.” Nikolai reached out taking Fyodor’s disembodied arm from him. “No you’re right. Fyodor and I… we never exchanged many words. But still my life since meeting him has felt like… nothing I did before had the same purpose as it did afterwards.”   Dazai knew what he meant.   There would never again be anyone quite like Fyodor Dostoevsky.   “Fyodor was right” Nikolai’s words snapped Dazai out of his inner monologue. “He told me I fought so I could lose myself.” Nikolai placed Fyo – Dostoevsky’s arm to his face. “And so now I just… ”   Dazai turned and walked away from the helicopters remains.   “Not going to grace us with your usual snarkiness?”   “Nah. Don’t feel like it.” He didn’t feel like doing anything at that moment it was as if Dostoevsky had taken Dazai’s happiness with him onto that helicopter. “I’d better take the antidote now.”   It didn’t feel like it really mattered anymore but still Fyodor wasn’t quite a beautiful lady for him to die with.   Beautiful he might have been but still…   Anyways it wouldn’t be double suicide just… double death.   Fyodor had wanted to live after all whilst Dazai didn’t really care.   One of the only major differences between them. Dazai didn’t usually like to admit even to himself how similar they were but now Fyodor was dead it didn’t matter.   But Fyodor had chosen to use his intelligence to force his own botched sense of justice upon the world using his pawns to target ‘sinners’ whereas Dazai used his to attempt to save as many lives as possible.   Once he was past Chuuya he could finally let that bright smile drop from his face.   He didn’t miss Dostoevsky exactly - well he missed being able to interact with someone as smart as himself and he missed being able to understand another human being but – okay maybe he missed Fedya a bit.   Fedya?!    He sighed shaking his head.   Why did he call Dostoevsky Fedya?!    “Something wrong Dazai?”   Chuuya startled him out of his thoughts.   “ Chuuya-sannn  I was just thinking of how short you are!”   “YOU-”    Dazai quickly reached for his pocket about to pretend to get a call – Crap. He had forgotten he was still in his prison clothes.   “ Chuuya-sannn  I’ve got to leave now.”   “Need a ride?”   “Yes please.”   Dazai was thankful for Chuuya’s company on the ride home.   Chuuya could tell something was wrong Dazai could tell by the fact that Chuuya kept talking with him even though he brushed him off multiple times.   Chuuya didn’t know what was wrong though. Hell Dazai didn’t even know himself.   That night he dreamt of Fedya.   “Dazai dear did you miss me?”    Fedya was standing almost uncomfortably close to him his piercing violet eyes gazing deep into his soul.    “Ah I see.” Dazai responded quickly adjusting to the situation. “You just can’t keep yourself away from me.”    Fedya’s eyes suddenly coldened further Dazai could even have sworn he saw a spark of red amongst the magenta.    “Homosexuality is a sin.”    Fyodor’s upper lip curled slightly as his posture stiffened. “I would never commit such a sin.”    “Ah well.” Dazai shrugged and crossed his arms. “Well if you ever change your mind…”    Fedya’s cloak (Since when did he wear that? That’s really tacky.) swayed as he leant back now standing fully upright.    “I-”    Dazai walked into the bathroom and splashed some water onto his face mentally preparing himself for the workday. Ugh.    He raised his head staring at his damp reflection in the mirror as water dripped from a strand of his wavy brown hair. In the golden morning light coming from the small bathroom window it seemed almost red.   Suddenly behind him in the mirror he saw a glimpse of sparkling magenta. He spun around quickly knocking the mirror to the floor where it shattered into a million fractals of light.   Fuck. He was hallucinating again.   He slumped to the floor his body splayed limply upon the tiles.   Why am I… disappointed?    I was the man that killed him why-?  A heavy weight rested in his stomach pulling him down into the depths of despair.   His head felt clouded like it had yesterday.   His thoughts spiralled around his head overpowering yet numbing at the same time.   A heavy weight rested in his stomach pulling him down into the depths of despair. He couldn’t breathe thoughts running away from him as he lay helplessly on the floor unable to think to move to even feel. His body was frozen barely noticing the glass digging into his back and numb to the warm blood seeping into his clothes.   His vision started blurring as tears fell from his eyes leaving silvery trails on his already moist skin.   Yet he wasn’t sad just… empty.   He needed to feel something anything.    His gaze alighted on a sharp glittering shard.   Dazai went to work with a new unseen bloom of red staining the otherwise pristine bandages winding around his upper arm.   The fragments of metal and glass lay on the floor of Dazai’s bathroom amidst a pool of blood reflecting light around the ivory room.   In the glass you could see the room’s reflection from a hundred different angles shattered into a million different pieces.   The room’s reflection alongside a glimmer of magenta and a flash of navy blue.   “Well isn’t this interesting.”    On the outside Dazai looked especially cheerful that day.   On the inside he wanted to cry.   “Kunikida-kunnn-”    “Kunikida-kunn-”   “Kunikida-kunnn-”    Kunikida finally snapped whirling around with a murderous glint in his eye.   “ OSAMU DAZAI IF ALL YOU’RE GOING TO DO ALL DAY IS BE ANNOYING YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO HOME.”   “Okay!”   Atsushi winced as Dazai skipped cheerfully out of the room.   ‘Kunikida-kunn’ sighed lifting up his glasses and rubbing his eyes.   “Sometimes Dazai makes me want to die.”   “You should probably go after him if you don’t want him to go home;” Ranpo interjected looking up from his bag of mochi.   “No it’s fine. I don’t have the energy to deal with him. I’ll just let him go.”   Dazai lay on the rug of his apartment staring blindly at the ceiling.   He didn’t know why but he felt depressed; even more than usual. A tear slowly spread across his eye turning his vision blurry as the film obscured his sight. The room was slowly blurring into simple blocks of blank colour.   The salty tears ran down his face slowly seeping into his hair as he softly sobbed each spasm shaking his body almost painfully.   His breathing was jagged and irregular too shallow and fast making him feel dizzy and faint.   He felt like he was slowly falling out of his life a simple side character in the story of someone else’s life detached and unimportant.   Shitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshit.    It had been a while since he last felt like this but it was not a new sensation; almost as far from it as possible. Like a watchful parent always just over his shoulder.  Usually he was with someone else both Kunikida and Chuuya knew what to do if he began to feel like this.   But by himself he couldn’t do anything at all to stop this indescribable feeling of despair from dragging him ever deeper.  “You really should check on him” Ranpo insisted.   “Alright fine-”   A loud ring interrupted him from Ranpo’s bag.   “Oooh Poe’s calling me!”   Ranpo dived under the table to answer the call from his supposed ‘rival’.   They act more like lovers than rivals; Kunikida thought. Oh well. I’d better see if Dazai is alright.    Suddenly Dazai felt a hand running through his hair bringing him back almost immediately.   His breath began to calm his tears slowly drying.   Once his vision began to clear Dazai felt the hand move away and he heard steps walking away from him.   He shakily rose up on his elbows his breath still unsteady but almost normal.   His vision was clear enough to just catch the edge of a cloak as it flew from the faceless figure as they leapt out the window unwilling to be seen.   Without a second thought he leapt out the window after the figure.   The harsh wind ripped open his eyelids causing fresh tears to leak out his eyes.   His vision began to fade splotches of black filling the gaps in his vision as his oxygen-deprived brain struggled to come up with an explanation for what the hell just happened.   The last thing he saw before he blacked out was a pair of sparkling magenta eyes.   That rat bastard?!    Oh shit I fell right into his trap.    Suddenly as he was only about two floors away from the ground he heard Kunikida’s voice screaming his name   “DAZAI!!”    Oh sh-    If you want to read more you can find it on AO3 here!,2024-10-28 14:13:26 GMT
17,ao3,['elsanna'  'fanfic'  'writing'],vanilla-lip-stick,Brainrot So I am about ten years late to the fandom started reading Elsanna fics about half a year ago. A few times before that Elsanna stories appeared in my AO3 searches but I shied away from those because of the incest aspect I won’t lie. However I was running out of femslash stories to read to I thought well I can read the unrelated stuff it’s fine.  I found those two utterly charming and adorable and I couldn’t get enough. So I eventually peeked into the pile of stories where they were sisters but not only sisters. And I still found them utterly charming and adorable but also at times broken repressed yearning hurting fighting loving. It quickly became my favourite ship (and it currently still is) and I particularly like the sister aspect because I always was a sucker for forbidden love always liked it when writers ventured into difficult territory asked difficult questions gave ambiguous answers because that’s what life usually is at least from my perspective.  After at the time of posting this five published stories on AO3 with about 70 k words I’ll tell you a little secret: I have never seen Frozen. Most I know about it and about Anna and Elsa I know from fics and bits and pieces from other sources. If you read hundreds of thousands of words of fanfiction about them I guess something sticks.  Also many of those fics have inspired ideas of my own. New entries keep popping up in my backlog and I already have about 50 outlined in various degrees. Just to give you a taste of what’s in there have this screenshot:  Yes those numbers on the right are page numbers. More numbers? Then have this:  Before I started to treat writing seriously some years ago before I finally committed myself to try my best to become a professional author I was one of those people you wondered: where do writers get all these ideas from? Now I find myself on the other end of the spectrum. I have too many ideas. (That above is mind you just my Elsanna backlog. My backlog for originals is even longer. Not that size matters.) There’s no way I could possibly turn every idea I have had until now into a story even if I turn 100. And sometimes this thought is so hard to cope with because while I don’t think each of these ideas is a gem there are many of them I love in one way or another.  (Some ideas I am really scared of and one in particular makes me sick whenever I stumble across it because it covers a topic I as a reader usually give a wide berth. Not so long ago I read a fic that had this thought I could perhaps take it and looking back I have so say: no I can’t and I have to fight the images in my head when I remember certain parts of the story to stay somewhat sane.)  Anyway. I wish writing didn’t take so long and I wish I were immortal until one day I decided I have had enough. I’m sure many of you can relate. (If there even is someone out there reading these ramblings. If there is come say hi. Or find my stories on AO3.),2024-10-28 14:12:10 GMT

0,ao3,['fyozai'  'fanfiction writing'  'archive of our own'  'idk'  'bungou stray dogs'  'fanfiction'  'i love them so much'  'this chapter mostly angst tho'  'angst'],fyodorsno1rat,Hi This is chapter one of my fyozai AO3 fic (fluff+angst):  jsyk thsi chapter is mostly angst and barely has fyodor sry but its jst bcs its the first chapter.  TW: implied/referenced sh violence/slight gore??? dissociation  &lt;!-- more --&gt;   …is that anaemic jackass dead?” Chuuya’s impatient voice sounded from behind him.   “Yeah Fyodor is no doubt dead.” He was sure Fyodor was dead yet somehow it didn’t feel…real.   “I see.”   Nikolai was also stood behind him approaching from the side of the tower. Dazai reached down and picked up Fyo - Dostoevsky’s arm.   He didn’t know why but Dazai felt emotionless - he wasn’t exactly sad although he would miss being able to have a challenging round of chess. He just felt…empty.   “Congrats Nikolai.” He couldn’t let his smile drop - not yet at least. “You wanted to kill him didn’t you?”   “Yeah I certainly did. Although at the same time I didn’t.” Nikolai reached out taking Fyodor’s disembodied arm from him. “No you’re right. Fyodor and I… we never exchanged many words. But still my life since meeting him has felt like… nothing I did before had the same purpose as it did afterwards.”   Dazai knew what he meant.   There would never again be anyone quite like Fyodor Dostoevsky.   “Fyodor was right” Nikolai’s words snapped Dazai out of his inner monologue. “He told me I fought so I could lose myself.” Nikolai placed Fyo – Dostoevsky’s arm to his face. “And so now I just… ”   Dazai turned and walked away from the helicopters remains.   “Not going to grace us with your usual snarkiness?”   “Nah. Don’t feel like it.” He didn’t feel like doing anything at that moment it was as if Dostoevsky had taken Dazai’s happiness with him onto that helicopter. “I’d better take the antidote now.”   It didn’t feel like it really mattered anymore but still Fyodor wasn’t quite a beautiful lady for him to die with.   Beautiful he might have been but still…   Anyways it wouldn’t be double suicide just… double death.   Fyodor had wanted to live after all whilst Dazai didn’t really care.   One of the only major differences between them. Dazai didn’t usually like to admit even to himself how similar they were but now Fyodor was dead it didn’t matter.   But Fyodor had chosen to use his intelligence to force his own botched sense of justice upon the world using his pawns to target ‘sinners’ whereas Dazai used his to attempt to save as many lives as possible.   Once he was past Chuuya he could finally let that bright smile drop from his face.   He didn’t miss Dostoevsky exactly - well he missed being able to interact with someone as smart as himself and he missed being able to understand another human being but – okay maybe he missed Fedya a bit.   Fedya?!    He sighed shaking his head.   Why did he call Dostoevsky Fedya?!    “Something wrong Dazai?”   Chuuya startled him out of his thoughts.   “ Chuuya-sannn  I was just thinking of how short you are!”   “YOU-”    Dazai quickly reached for his pocket about to pretend to get a call – Crap. He had forgotten he was still in his prison clothes.   “ Chuuya-sannn  I’ve got to leave now.”   “Need a ride?”   “Yes please.”   Dazai was thankful for Chuuya’s company on the ride home.   Chuuya could tell something was wrong Dazai could tell by the fact that Chuuya kept talking with him even though he brushed him off multiple times.   Chuuya didn’t know what was wrong though. Hell Dazai didn’t even know himself.   That night he dreamt of Fedya.   “Dazai dear did you miss me?”    Fedya was standing almost uncomfortably close to him his piercing violet eyes gazing deep into his soul.    “Ah I see.” Dazai responded quickly adjusting to the situation. “You just can’t keep yourself away from me.”    Fedya’s eyes suddenly coldened further Dazai could even have sworn he saw a spark of red amongst the magenta.    “Homosexuality is a sin.”    Fyodor’s upper lip curled slightly as his posture stiffened. “I would never commit such a sin.”    “Ah well.” Dazai shrugged and crossed his arms. “Well if you ever change your mind…”    Fedya’s cloak (Since when did he wear that? That’s really tacky.) swayed as he leant back now standing fully upright.    “I-”    Dazai walked into the bathroom and splashed some water onto his face mentally preparing himself for the workday. Ugh.    He raised his head staring at his damp reflection in the mirror as water dripped from a strand of his wavy brown hair. In the golden morning light coming from the small bathroom window it seemed almost red.   Suddenly behind him in the mirror he saw a glimpse of sparkling magenta. He spun around quickly knocking the mirror to the floor where it shattered into a million fractals of light.   Fuck. He was hallucinating again.   He slumped to the floor his body splayed limply upon the tiles.   Why am I… disappointed?    I was the man that killed him why-?  A heavy weight rested in his stomach pulling him down into the depths of despair.   His head felt clouded like it had yesterday.   His thoughts spiralled around his head overpowering yet numbing at the same time.   A heavy weight rested in his stomach pulling him down into the depths of despair. He couldn’t breathe thoughts running away from him as he lay helplessly on the floor unable to think to move to even feel. His body was frozen barely noticing the glass digging into his back and numb to the warm blood seeping into his clothes.   His vision started blurring as tears fell from his eyes leaving silvery trails on his already moist skin.   Yet he wasn’t sad just… empty.   He needed to feel something anything.    His gaze alighted on a sharp glittering shard.   Dazai went to work with a new unseen bloom of red staining the otherwise pristine bandages winding around his upper arm.   The fragments of metal and glass lay on the floor of Dazai’s bathroom amidst a pool of blood reflecting light around the ivory room.   In the glass you could see the room’s reflection from a hundred different angles shattered into a million different pieces.   The room’s reflection alongside a glimmer of magenta and a flash of navy blue.   “Well isn’t this interesting.”    On the outside Dazai looked especially cheerful that day.   On the inside he wanted to cry.   “Kunikida-kunnn-”    “Kunikida-kunn-”   “Kunikida-kunnn-”    Kunikida finally snapped whirling around with a murderous glint in his eye.   “ OSAMU DAZAI IF ALL YOU’RE GOING TO DO ALL DAY IS BE ANNOYING YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO HOME.”   “Okay!”   Atsushi winced as Dazai skipped cheerfully out of the room.   ‘Kunikida-kunn’ sighed lifting up his glasses and rubbing his eyes.   “Sometimes Dazai makes me want to die.”   “You should probably go after him if you don’t want him to go home;” Ranpo interjected looking up from his bag of mochi.   “No it’s fine. I don’t have the energy to deal with him. I’ll just let him go.”   Dazai lay on the rug of his apartment staring blindly at the ceiling.   He didn’t know why but he felt depressed; even more than usual. A tear slowly spread across his eye turning his vision blurry as the film obscured his sight. The room was slowly blurring into simple blocks of blank colour.   The salty tears ran down his face slowly seeping into his hair as he softly sobbed each spasm shaking his body almost painfully.   His breathing was jagged and irregular too shallow and fast making him feel dizzy and faint.   He felt like he was slowly falling out of his life a simple side character in the story of someone else’s life detached and unimportant.   Shitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshit.    It had been a while since he last felt like this but it was not a new sensation; almost as far from it as possible. Like a watchful parent always just over his shoulder.  Usually he was with someone else both Kunikida and Chuuya knew what to do if he began to feel like this.   But by himself he couldn’t do anything at all to stop this indescribable feeling of despair from dragging him ever deeper.  “You really should check on him” Ranpo insisted.   “Alright fine-”   A loud ring interrupted him from Ranpo’s bag.   “Oooh Poe’s calling me!”   Ranpo dived under the table to answer the call from his supposed ‘rival’.   They act more like lovers than rivals; Kunikida thought. Oh well. I’d better see if Dazai is alright.    Suddenly Dazai felt a hand running through his hair bringing him back almost immediately.   His breath began to calm his tears slowly drying.   Once his vision began to clear Dazai felt the hand move away and he heard steps walking away from him.   He shakily rose up on his elbows his breath still unsteady but almost normal.   His vision was clear enough to just catch the edge of a cloak as it flew from the faceless figure as they leapt out the window unwilling to be seen.   Without a second thought he leapt out the window after the figure.   The harsh wind ripped open his eyelids causing fresh tears to leak out his eyes.   His vision began to fade splotches of black filling the gaps in his vision as his oxygen-deprived brain struggled to come up with an explanation for what the hell just happened.   The last thing he saw before he blacked out was a pair of sparkling magenta eyes.   That rat bastard?!    Oh shit I fell right into his trap.    Suddenly as he was only about two floors away from the ground he heard Kunikida’s voice screaming his name   “DAZAI!!”    Oh sh-    If you would like to read more you can find it on AO3 here!,2024-10-28 14:03:35 GMT

If anything you get a few words long line which ok fair but it is discouraging. Fic writers spend endless weeks months or even years crafting a full-fleshed story for people to read FOR FREE it would be nice to at least get some comments to know if people like it and if they did what they like and what they don’t. I don’t know feedback you know? Kudos or other forms of voting are about the only way to know if people are liking what you wrote cause hits may not reflect whether someone read the whole fic or just entered to have a look and left.  Anyways as I said it’s discouraging. I like to write and I have a massive wip that I want to continue but yeah will anyone actually bother to read it and give at least some feedback?

They act more like lovers than rivals; Kunikida thought. Oh well. I’d better see if Dazai is alright.    Suddenly Dazai felt a hand running through his hair bringing him back almost immediately.   His breath began to calm his tears slowly drying.   Once his vision began to clear Dazai felt the hand move away and he heard steps walking away from him.   He shakily rose up on his elbows his breath still unsteady but almost normal.   His vision was clear enough to just catch the edge of a cloak as it flew from the faceless figure as they leapt out the window unwilling to be seen.   Without a second thought he leapt out the window after the figure.   The harsh wind ripped open his eyelids causing fresh tears to leak out his eyes.   His vision began to fade splotches of black filling the gaps in his vision as his oxygen-deprived brain struggled to come up with an explanation for what the hell just happened.   The last thing he saw before he blacked out was a pair of sparkling magenta eyes.   That rat bastard?!    Oh shit I fell right into his trap.    Suddenly as he was only about two floors away from the ground he heard Kunikida’s voice screaming his name   “DAZAI!!”    Oh sh-    If you want to read more you can find it on AO3 here!,2024-10-28 14:13:26 GMT

Flat.  Detached.  But for reasons Agatha couldn’t begin to untangle those words burrowed deeper inside her than any smirk taunt or glance Rio had ever given her.  The neutrality of it twisted within her winding tighter and tighter until it felt like something inside her snap.  “Wait.”  Agatha’s voice cut through the quiet and she looked up and watched as her words landed.  Rio stopped turning back her expression blank unreadable as if she were just… waiting.  Waiting watching with that calm detachment that felt like an insult.  Agatha’s jaw clenched.  She hated that look.  Hated the emptiness in it.  Hated the way Rio could stand there as if she hadn’t the very person who dismantled everything Agatha thought she knew about herself forcing her onto this twisting relentless journey of self-discovery with no end in sight.  How could she just step back now as if she hadn’t taken a hammer to Agatha’s sense of self?  Just walk away?  That simmering anger rose propelling her next words.  “Stop looking at me like that” she snapped her voice laced with an intensity she could barely contain.  Rio didn’t so much as blink her composure as steady as ever.  “I don’t understand” she said her voice maddeningly calm. “Did I do something to offend you?”  Agatha’s fingers tightened around the edge of her desk. Every part of her wanted to scream to demand an answer but the words lodged in her throat caught between frustration and vulnerability.  “Yes actually” Agatha snapped instead her voice slicing through the air sharper than intended.  Rio’s brow arched a glimmer of something in her eyes—curiosity maybe surprise—before it quickly vanished. She tilted her head slightly her tone gentler than Agatha could stand.  “What did I do?”  A hollow laugh escaped Agatha cold and brittle she stood up needing to level the playing field—needing to look her in the eye.  “What haven’t you done?” she bit out each word dripping with barely contained frustration. “You’ve completely ruined me. Do you even realize that?”  Rio held her gaze the weight of her own silence enough to stoke the embers of Agatha’s anger.  Rio’s face softened but she didn’t look away.  Instead she stepped closer her gaze steady unflinching.  “Ruined you?” she echoed her voice low a touch of sadness laced within her usual calm. “How exactly have I ruined you Agatha?”  Agatha’s throat tightened and her fingers curled grasping for control she no longer had.  “You made me question everything I thought I knew about myself” she whispered almost to herself. “You’ve made me want things I can’t have things I never even thought I’d want.”  Rio’s gaze remained unwavering a quiet intensity simmering in her eyes.  “Why can’t you have them?” she asked her voice barely a murmur. “I told you Agatha all you had to is ask?”  The simplicity of it—just asking—sent a surge of frustration through Agatha mingling with a longing so strong it felt like a physical ache.  She let out a bitter breathless laugh.  “Just ask?” she repeated a tremor in her voice. “What exactly would I even ask for?”  Rio’s gaze softened her lips curving into a faint smile one that held a thousand unspoken promises.  “That depends. What do you want Agatha?”  The question hit her like a wave crashing into the carefully built walls she’d surrounded herself with. And in that moment the weight of her own vulnerability was almost too much to bear.  She felt a sting in her eyes—tears actual fucking tears—and she swallowed hard willing them away.  The silence thickened and Rio stepped closer again closer than they’ve been in days.  “Tell me what you want” she whispered her voice a quiet invitation filled with a tenderness Agatha hadn’t expected.  Agatha’s pulse thundered in her ears as she stood there feeling the weight of Rio’s words settle over her wrapping around her like a tether both binding and freeing.  This was it.  She knew it felt it in every nerve every tremor of her racing heart.  It was that precipice—the moment before a jump the second a skydiver teeters on the edge of the open door staring down at the dizzying drop caught between two choices: retreat back into the safety of the plane or leap forward into the unknown letting gravity pull them into a freefall they couldn’t control.  Her mind spun half-tempted to pull herself back to escape the raw vulnerability of the moment.  But her body—the way it leaned ever so slightly closer to Rio her breath quickening in anticipation—betrayed her.  She wanted this.  Needed it.  All she had to do was say the words.

Agatha felt a tremor roll through her as she stood there feeling each of her defenses fall away piece by piece under the weight of that stare.

Four days since she drew the line in the sand between them and said “don’t cross it.”  And in true form Rio had done just that—no smirks no lingering touches no flirtatious banter.  It was all professional now.  Impeccably maddeningly professional.  And it was torture.  The tension that had once buzzed between them had disappeared replaced by a stark void that left her feeling unbalanced. Their once-charged exchanges now felt lifeless as if she was speaking into a mirror instead of the spark that had lit her up in ways she’d refused to acknowledge.  Her chest tightened as she thought of the moments when a fleeting smirk or a word laced with hidden meaning would’ve changed her for the entire day.  But now?  There was nothing.  It was like staring at a starry sky covered in thick impenetrable clouds. The spark was still there but it was hidden beyond Agatha’s reach now.  Agatha clenched her hands into fists resisting the urge to curse herself for every confused thought she’d wrestled with since Tuesday. She’d made her choice demanded her boundaries. And yet she couldn’t shake the dull ache that had settled within her each day feeling a little greyer each interaction a little emptier.  Not even the progress Rio had made on the Vanguard case—work that was undeniably impressive—held any real satisfaction for her.  She could hardly focus on the details anymore too wrapped up in what had been lost between them.  It didn’t help that each night as she undressed brushed her teeth and prepared to sleep the tension in her body would unfurl in waves stirring up memories of Rio’s dark intense gaze the graze of her hands the low gravelly timbre of her voice teasing at the edge of Agatha’s self-control.  She’d clenched her jaw already knowing where her thoughts would drift the same way they had every night since the professional distance had settled between them.  And no matter how hard she tried to ignore it her resolve would eventually falter.  Her mind would helplessly replay the sound of what had once been Rio’s voice that low teasing murmur; the flash of her smirk; the feel of her hands imagined but vivid lingering like a phantom touch.  Each time breathless and aching Agatha would surrender slipping her hand beneath the band of her silk pants chasing a release that always came too quickly leaving her spent and satisfied yet still haunted.  Because now even in the quiet aftermath Rio never left her mind.  Somehow the woman had burrowed beneath her skin her presence lingering long after the warmth of release faded like an echo she couldn’t silence.  Rio was rooted in her deep and undeniable as if each whisper of her memory declared “I live here now.”  Agatha wanted to scream.  She was forty-eight for Christ’s sake.  She was far too old for a… sexual awakening?  An identity crisis?  A kink revelation?  Or whatever the hell this actually was.  And yet here she was: Nearly fifty more confused than she’d ever been in her life so insatiably frustrated and so ridiculously impossibly turned on she quite literally could not think straight.  Rio Vidal a woman 16 years younger than herself had stepped into Agatha’s carefully constructed Jenga-tower of life circling it like a hawk. With each pass she probed at Agatha’s core pieces searching for any weakness any tremor before methodically slipping them away with chilling precision.  Agatha could feel each absence a hollow ache expanding within her revealing emptiness she hadn’t known existed until Rio showed her.  But Rio didn’t just take—she was also rebuilding.  Layering unfamiliar thrilling pieces onto Agatha’s foundation forcing her to sway on the edge of everything she thought she understood. Every extracted piece every newly added layer left her precarious teetering in a dizzying balance between fear and exhilaration.  And Rio—she stood there just watching never once looking away.  Rio’s held her gaze with an intensity that felt like a dare inviting Agatha to give in—to fall.  Let me break you those dark eyes seemed to say and then I’ll put you back together in a way you never thought possible.

And then with a certainty that both terrified and thrilled her she turned back and met Rio’s gaze feeling something snap inside her—a release raw and undeniable.  “I want you.”  Unraveled - Chapter 11 - EchoesInTheMargins - Agatha All Along (TV) Archive of Our Own   Unraveled,2024-10-28 16:57:08 GMT

Here we have Edward  He can change how big the eyes are but not change the shape same goes for his mouth but he has more freedom in that he can make the corners not stay in the happy face up position when bro gets angry the blue color fades until it is blank letting his brain and tongues be shown in a black void.  Out of the 4 he is the easiest to figure out what the expression actually is as long as you pay attention to the corners of his mouth.  Next we have Gordon (The Warden)  Gordon can move the bottom of his eyes and can move his mouth every slightly as long as it stays as some form of a frown when bro gets angry the souls of the damn form and swirl around in his eyes and mouth holes.  Not the hardest to figure out in terms of emotions just need to pay attention to the eyebrows mostly (like most of them tbh)  And here we have Radar the mf that has the hardest anger face to draw  His can change as long as his mouth and eyes are circular or oval when angry rows of teeth in a spiral motion emerge around the corners of the mouth until it looks like… that…     So yeah that’s how facial expressions work for 3 out of the 4 people that have Fred as a rent free tenant-,2024-10-28 18:52:06 GMT

The words felt like a surrender and a release leaving her feeling weightless as though in that one vulnerable confession she’d given in entirely.  Agatha leaned in her resolve crumbling as the need to feel Rio’s lips against hers became overwhelming a quiet ache turning sharp. Her hand moved up to rest on Rio’s arm fingers curling into her sleeve as she closed the distance breaths mingling the warmth between them almost too much to bear.  Just as her lips were about to meet Rio’s she felt the pressure of Rio’s hand tighten around her neck a firm but gentle restraint that stopped her in place. Rio pulled back just enough to catch Agatha’s gaze her eyes filled with that same dark commanding intensity that sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine.  Agatha froze her heart racing beneath Rio’s thumb her lips parted with the expectation lingering in the air.   And then Rio’s voice dropped to a soft relentless challenge.  “Ask.”  A surge of frustration coursed through Agatha hot and insistent blending with a thrill she couldn’t deny.  She hated the way it stripped her bare the way it made her feel as if she had no defenses left.  It was as if Rio could see right through her unraveling her layer by layer drawing out her desires without permission pulling her wants and needs straight from the core of her with an infuriating ease.  The words slipped out before she could stop them a soft urgent confession she could no longer hold back.  “Can I kiss you?” she asked her voice low edged with desperation.  She was too far gone too caught up to feel the sting of embarrassment now though she knew it would come later would haunt her when she thought of this moment—how she had caved how she had let herself surrender without a fight.  But right now she didn’t care.  She was breathless open every inch of her drawn toward Rio as if nothing else in the world mattered but this—the thrill the ache the need burning between them.  Rio’s eyes flashed her gaze sparking with satisfaction a wicked gleam that sent a tremor down Agatha’s spine.  That pleased look alone made Agatha’s knees weak and she felt Rio’s grip soften fingers gliding along the side of her neck before slipping into her hair.  Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s fingers threaded through the strands pressing and scraping against her scalp grounding her in a sensation that was both intense and achingly tender.  A low groan escaped Agatha as Rio’s hand tightened fingers curling at the root pulling her head back just enough to remind her who held control.  The tension thrummed a tantalizing ache that wasn’t pain but something far more consuming—a release.  Rio guided her forward with a control that radiated dominance each movement precise and deliberate until Agatha felt the soft warm press of Rio’s lips against her own a touch that stole her breath entirely.  Agatha’s instinct was to surge forward to close the gap and lose herself in the kiss but Rio’s fingers held her in place firm and unyielding keeping her right where she wanted her.  Every second felt like a slow burn the tension building stretching leaving Agatha helpless to do anything but yield to feel every inch of Rio’s control.  And then instead of the kiss she craved she felt Rio’s words whispered against her lips each one a soft taunting caress.  “Good girl” Rio purred her voice a low reverent murmur that seemed to sink into Agatha’s very bones igniting something that had been buried waiting.  And then Rio closed the distance claiming her in a searing kiss that left no question no hesitation branding those words into Agatha’s soul in a way she knew she’d never forget.

So when the time comes where he’d finally truly willing to risk it all what happens?     I’m Apollyon and He’s my Galatea: Aventurine will blame it on the alcohol and loneliness. Ratio will blame it on frustration and sleep deprivation. Neither of them expected to come together like this. Walls so carefully built up skillfully over the years.

You’ve been separated from Zoro for what feels like a century and you’re unsure what tomorrow will bring. So you better make the most of your evening who knows when the next time you’ll have this chance again is if ever.   A/N: Sorry for taking the break everyone I had completely forgotten I had a work conference which really derailed my schedule and writing efforts. But no matter I have every intention of finishing what I started even if that means Kinktober is gonna sneak into November!  &lt;!-- more --&gt; Sitting side by side with your crew for what felt like the first time in years seemed almost surreal. Hearing everyone laughing together praising Sanji for his cooking and feeling Zoro’s arms brush up against your own it felt like a dream.      Despite everything going on in Wano everyone had pushed for one meal just the Strawhats to reunite and catch up. You had just spent weeks in Whole Cake going head to head with Sanji’s entire family. Despite all that your mind never strayed far from the swordsman. It had only been a few weeks before splitting up that you two had started exploring a relationship but yet that time apart felt monumentous.      As the night went on cups were clinked bellies were filled and everyone caught up on the events of the last few weeks. You were trying your best to focus on your crew laughing at every dumb joke because truthfully there was a point where you were unsure whether or not the crew would ever be reunited but when you felt Zoro’s big hand on your bare thigh it was difficult to focus on anything else. The way his thumb moved in tantalizing circles on your inner thigh the rough pads of his fingers pressing into your fat it was making your body react more then you were willing to admit. You wanted to look at him to meet his gaze for him to see just how much his touch was affecting you but you knew the moment he looked down at you you wouldn’t be able to think about anything else.      Slowly crew members began excusing themselves leaving the small hut you had commandeered for your meal. You began mentally counting down the minutes until you could slip away praying the swordsman would follow not far behind. Once more then half the crew had left you felt it was appropriate that you too left. You stood up feeling his hand slide down your thigh before landing next to him on the bench where you were sitting. “I think I’m gonna go for a walk see what I can of Wano before everything goes down.” You stepped out from around the table hazarding a look over your shoulder at Zoro who’s eyes were on you quickly picking up what you were putting down.      There was the slightest nip in the air as a cool night breeze rustled the bamboo as you walked down the stone steps leading away from the building. You had yet to be thankful for the number of layers that were required to wear such a beautiful kimono rarely getting the opportunity to dress in something so pretty while you were adventuring but as another gust blew through you the layers managed to keep you warm. You stopped at the bottom of the steps listening close to hear a set of footsteps coming down the stairs behind you. You turned seeing the large man walking down the steps like he had a thousand times his hand on the hilt of Wado while the other rubbed at the back of his neck you couldn’t take your eyes off him. He looked so him.      “Oi you just gonna stare all night?” You hadn’t realized he was in front of you standing a few steps up and looking down.      “You got a problem if I do?” He shifted his weight his eyes taking you in the same way you had him. He thought you had never looked more stunning then you did right now the matcha green of your simple kimono was a perfect contrast to your eyes the soft pink of your obi likely the most feminine thing he had seen you in he silently wished you would bring this dress back to the ship with you so this wouldn’t be the last time he saw you in it. But of course he would rather never drink another drop of sake again before telling you that.      “If starin’ is all you’re gonna do I’ll just go back up and start another bottle of sake.” He went down the few remaining steps slipped his arm around your waist and tugged you towards the path.      “Oh did you have other plans for the rest of our evening?”      “Got a few ideas.” He led you quietly before forcing you down a footpath into the forest. You wanted to question him but the hand that had been on your hip had slipped lower his fingers pressing into the meat of your ass. Something that due to the layer you could barely feel. He led you to a clearing there was a hint of a foot path through here but since it was so late into the evening there was no one around.      With ease he pushed you against a cluster of bamboo trees closing the distance between the two of you before you could even blink. His lips were on yours teeth and tongue invading your mouth groaning into the kiss as his hands grabbed roughly at your hips. Your senses were taken over by him his earthy musk paired with the fresh air of the forest was intoxicating to you every breath you tried to push out was swallowed by him greedily. He loved the green robe from his shoulders working to untie his obi his lips never pulling away from yours even slightly. He nipped at your lower lip pulling a breathy sigh from you getting a groan from him in response. “Fuckin’ missed you.” You almost missed it the words muffled by your own mouth. His hands were back on you his obi tossed aside as he began pulling at your many layers.      ”Z-zo be careful.” You pulled your head far enough away from him to get the sentence out looking down between you to see his scarred hands that were yanking at your belt almost to the point of tearing. You put your hands over his stilling his pulling.      ”Take it off.” He pressed his forehead to your’s his breath coming out in pants as though he were a wild animal.      “I-I can’t.”      “If it’s not off in ten seconds I’m gonna rip it off.”      “I can’t retie it.” He grabbed you by the hips forcibly turning you around before pulling at the bow. Within seconds the tight fabric that had been holding everything together was pulled off tossed on the ground next to his. You were spun around again his hands working the small ties that were keeping the layers closed apart not stopping until he felt your warm skin against his hands. He pulled your kimono open holding it wide as though he was displaying your body to him a curse falling from his lips unconsciously.      Beneath the fabric you were wearing very little only a pair of black panties your chest completely bare. Quickly you slipped your thumbs in the sides of your panties knowing it was either that or they would be ripped clean in two if left on forcing them down your legs and kicking them in the general direction of your obi. While he was gocking openly at you something you would have expected of Sanji not the green haired swordsman you let your eyes run down his body. His yukata hung open partially surprised he even kept it on. His cock was bobbing as he looked you over a small bead of pre cum on the head.      Before you could stop yourself you were wrapping your fingers around his cock feeling the raging heat radiating from the appendage followed by a low groan. He dropped your kimono from his hand opting instead to brace himself on a culm of bamboo behind you his head dropping as he began losing himself in the pleasure of someone else’s hand. His hips weakly bucked into your hand you ran your thumb over the head gathering that little bit of pre cum and working it down his shaft. With every twist of your hand he let out a heavy breath his teeth clenched and his gaze locked onto your body as you moved. His brain was overrun with pleasure he wanted to say things to you to whisper the dirtiest shit in your ear all the things he had wanted to say to you over these past weeks. But his mind was completely blank the only thing he was capable of understanding was how good your hand felt. “I missed you too.” You leaned your face forward so you could bring your lips to his his kiss was lazy his tongue slipping into your mouth the same way it would early in the morning as you kissed him as he came to bed after a night watch. “Missed you so much.” He hummed against you his hips meeting your hand every time groaning as you used your other hand to massage his balls as you sped up your hand.      He almost didn’t stop you as he felt his peak approach. Grabbing your wrist seconds before he was about to cum felt like the hardest thing he had ever done. But you didn’t question it knowing what it meant. You let go of him leaning against the bamboo behind you and watching as he tried to pull himself together.      His eyebrows furrowed jaw clenched as he tried to force his orgasm away. Knowing that when he tethered on the edge like that something as simple as kissing you after so many weeks was enough to tip him over. You brought your hands to his face forcing him to look at you as you stepped closer to him needing to feel his body against yours. His arms wrapped around you exactly as you remembered your arms around his neck and his around your waist his face pressing into the top of your head as yours rests against his chest. He hadn’t realized just how much he had missed you always trying to remain focused on the task at hand and knowing you were strong enough to take care of yourself when he wasn’t around. But despite all that it felt like a small piece of him was finally back.      Since starting this relationship there were very few moments like this. Zoro was never an overly sentimental person preferring to show his feelings in quality time togerher rather then acts of affections but he thought he could stand and hold you like this for hours. That was until your hand encircled his cock again gripping it tightly around the base as you looked up at him your eyes wide and pleading.     ”Zo we don’t know what’s gonna’ go down tomorrow.” He noted the hint of anxiety underlining your words making him squeeze you tighter. “What if this is the last time we…” Your words faded knowing he understood what you meant. Something about the volume of Wano the foes you knew you’d face even the ones you already had for the first time since you joined the Strawhats you questioned if you were going to be strong enough.      “Guess I’ll have to fuck you like it’s the last time huh.” The jest in his voice the half smile on his lips were his attempt to ease your concern but he knew it wouldn’t be enough and he made a mental note to reassure you every chance he got.     He let go of your waist kicking your legs apart with his knee so he could drag one finger between your folds. A breathy moan slipped from your lips as you leaned back against the bamboo your head tipping back. “You’re practically dripping.” He knelt down his free hand pressing the pads of his fingers into the meat of your thigh. He used his thumb to pull your lips apart his face close enough that you could feel his hot breath where you so desperately needed his lips.      Without really thinking your fingers grabbed his short hair and forced his face into your cunt. Never in your life with him or any previous partners had you pulled such a bold move but you had been more desperate for him then ever before and the moment you felt his breath on you you were done for. You felt him smile against your folds before his tongue lapped at your slick. You pushed your hips out hoping it would give him more access a long moan slipped from your lips when he pressed a thick finger into you.      You were so lost in the pleasure you completely missed the way he looked up at you. He was absolutely enamored by you the way your hips were rutting against his face your free hand coming up to cup your breast as a steady slew of moans flowed freely from your lips. He worked a second finger into you your cunt tighter then even the first time he did this as he flicked his tongue over your clit again and against. Your hair was beginning to slip from the makeshift bun Robin had done for you your tresses framing your face in a way that made Zoro’s cock twitch.      He forced a third finger in spreading them wide so try and speed up the process as he began sucking your clit making your fingers dig into his scalp. “Fuck j-just like that.” Your voice was breathy but you could feel your peak as he abused your bundle of nerves forcing you over the edge when you felt him groan against you the slapping of his fingers against your cunt drowned out by your long moan. The moment your orgasm was beginning to subside he was off the ground grabbing the backs of your thighs and picking you up. Your arms wrapped around his waist as did your ankles locking around his waist. He was quick to push his cock into you wasting no time taking it slow and bottoming out almost immediately.      The feeling of your nails biting into his nape was the only indication he needed to slow down a touch giving you a moment to adjust to his size before starting to fuck you. The feeling of his warmth surrounding you his strong arms around you his body pressing you against the bamboo that was quickly warming to your skin it was all so overwhelming after so long without being touched. It was a blessing none of your crew happened to walk by the foot path because there was no way for you to keep your sounds muffled. With every press of his cock into you he would let out a low groan almost a growl his face pressed into your shoulder as his thrusts sped up his end clearly approaching quicker then normal. “Fuck you look so g-good all dressed up pretty for m-me.” From the moment he had seen you all made up hair pulled back and such a feminine kimono cinching you in place forcing you to stand up straight you had been able to tell how much he liked this look for you his eyes racking over you like a tiger eyeing prey. He ran his tongue over your shoulder and up the side of your neck the salty taste of sweat causing him to moan right in your ear. “Think you’re tighter then the first time I fucked you.” You couldn’t stop the whimper that slipped past your lips at his words forgetting the way his growl made your whole body rumble. ”Touch yourself for me baby girl.” Your eyes lidded your hooded gaze locked on his as you slipped on hand from around his neck expecting to feel less secure between him and the trees but he just pressed against you harder. You were quick to press the pads of your fingers to your clit working them in erotic lazy circles quickly increasing the speed until your fingers were matching his ragged pace.      You wanted to say something to him tell him how much you missed his cock how badly you had craved him while you were apart but every attempt at words failed when all that came from your mouth was a wanton moan. “Wanna’ fill you.” You were barely able to catch the grumble into your shoulder his teeth nipping at your neck as he fucked you into the bamboo behind you. ”Wanna’ make sure ‘veryone knows your mine if it’s the last thing I-I do.”      “Zo” Your brow furrowed the words being fucked out of you “C-can you c-cum ins-side me” The desire had never been stronger to have him fill you completely. Not knowing what tomorrow held you figured might as well give into fantasy if it was your last time.      “You want me to fuck my seed into you?” You felt him smile against your skin his canines grazing where your shoulder meets your neck as his pace somehow increased.      “Gods yes make me y-yours.” His growled against you his hips pounding into you so hard you knew you’d have bruises along your entire back.      “Gonna’ make sure ‘veryone knows who you belong to.” It was hard for your fingers to keep up opting to rub your fingers together with your clit squished between bringin you to a mounting orgasm that squeezed his cock like a vice. You were so cock drunk riding your orgasm out moans cusses and his name leaving your lips like a chant. He was close behind you the feeling of your cunt milking him was enough to force his orgasm crashing over him his groan long and low in your ear. His hips slowed but didn’t stop ensuring his seed filled every nook and crevice of your insides sullying you for anyone else.      His breath was hot against your chest his body still pressed against yours to make sure you didn’t slip out of the rather precarious position he had you in. Your hands were limp one dangling at your side the other loosely holding onto his neck. Your thighs were beginning to burn from the position your ankles still locked around his hips but your legs felt sore. You wanted to say something anything thank him for a thorough fuck or tell him how much you missed him but no matter what elequant sentence you pieced together in your brain you were completely unable to get it from thought into formed words. Instead all you could do was whimper his girth stretching you out to a point where your clit was stimulated from the inside which had been a blessing but was not a point of major overstimulation. This paired with the ache throughout your lower half forced you to squirm in his grip snapping him out of his post-climax fog.      With ease he grabbed the back of your thighs again stepped away from the trees and lowered you down enough that your pins and needled feet could touch the ground. The change in position made the cum that has been corked inside of you was now beginning to slip out of your well fucked entrance a feeling you had not accounted for in the moment and now made you cringe. You leaned back against the trees behind you trying to catch your breath which seemed near impossible while looking him up and down. His cock was still half hard but on its way to flaccid his chest pink from exertion and his eyes looking over your body the same way you were his.      He stepped forward his hands moving to the sides of your off white kimono undergarments pulling the fabric closed and tying it with surprising delicateness clearly this type of clothing was nowhere as new to him as it was you. He repeated the action with each layer reaching down for your obi and gently turning you around. His tie wasn’t as elegant as Robin’s had been but it was better then what you would have been able to do. You turned to watch him get redressed with practiced hands watching as he bent down to pick up his own obi while grabbing your discarded panties. “What’re y-“ A smirk spread across his lips as he leaned in to press a kiss to your temple his lips moving against your skin as he tucked your panties into his yukata.     ”Good luck charm”,2024-10-28 19:06:12 GMT

It had been nearly twenty-four hours since you had returned home alone and gathered up the courage to send her a text to ask her out and she hadn’t responded. You were on the verge of a meltdown the mug of tea in your hand so close to flying across the room and into the wall of your living room that you really should have put it down altogether. Why hadn’t she responded? What was taking so long? She had proven herself to be a rather skilled and available communicator. She responded relatively quickly and wasn’t afraid to show you that she wanted to text you which was why you had come into the conclusion that you had done something wrong. You couldn’t think of another reason. Natasha had been put off by your dinner invite. That must have been it. Or then you were a bad kisser. No that was it. She had been let down by your stupid lips. Maybe your mouth had been too wet or you had used too much tongue but whatever it was that you had done it had driven her away.  &lt;!-- more --&gt; You looked down at your tea watching the surface ripple your hand trembling ever so slightly. You wanted to scream oh you wanted to punch someone your body longing for violence to help you through the intensity of your negative emotions. You took in a deep breath glancing outside into the darkening night a sharp squeeze of your heart bringing a frown to your face. You knew you weren’t actually angry you were just trying to be doing your best to camouflage the pain that you felt. It was easier to be angry at her than to feel the disappointment of being forgotten. You had been so excited the day before you had been over the moon from morning to evening and through the night after she had finally walked you home to make sure you didn’t find any trouble alone in the city. She had accompanied you all the way to your front door having held your hand until the very moment she had told you that she had to go. She hadn’t mentioned to you where she was going nor what she was doing but it hadn’t bothered you then despite having expected her to come inside your apartment. But as time passed your imagination had started to steal the spotlight. Maybe she had another woman maybe she just wanted something casual maybe you’d done something off-putting maybe you weren’t enough and she was just trying to figure out a way to let you down easy. Whatever the case may have been you couldn’t understand what had caused her to disappear like that. Surely an adult woman would have the means to communicate her emotions better than a middle schooler. The betrayal that you felt went much deeper than the surface your dignity wounded from having made the decision to trust yet another person who didn’t value you and your time. But it wasn’t just betrayal that you felt you also felt incredibly naive and stupid for having imagined that you were special to her that you were somehow worth more than any other woman walking down the street. And what made it all hurt just that little bit more was that you had known better from the moment that you had been pierced by a Cupid’s arrow you had known that it would inevitably end in pain yet you had allowed yourself to fall in love anyway. You had blindly ignored every warning sign that your intuition and past trauma had sent your way and opened up your heart to someone who you didn’t even know. All you could do was sit in the disappointing aftermath of your own foolish decisions.  You heard a gentle knock your pouty frown suddenly directed at the front door as you turned around to look at it as if to will the person behind it to go away but despite your grumpiness you set your mug down and headed for the door swiftly unlocking it to find an old lady standing at your doorstep. You smiled at her immediately recognizing your neighbor who you had met on multiple occasions in the hallways of the building. She gave you a warm smile offering you a plate with a bread cloth over it before even greeting you.  “Hi dear I brought you some snickerdoodles” Mrs. Verlice said in her aged and strained voice shoving the plate right into your arms. “Johnny bought six sticks of butter cause they were on sale. That stupid old bastard” she nearly bellowed her face remaining stoic but you knew that she meant it lovingly. “I had to make something.”  “I love snickerdoodles” you said brightly smiling through the tears that threatened to spring into your eyes from the old woman’s thoughtful gesture.  “Good. We’re one cookie away from being fat.” Your smile turned a little more genuine Mrs. Verlice’s grumpy attitude never failing to amuse you. She was rough around the edges and always found the negative in everything but not once had she disrespected you. “Eat as much as you want. We got more across the hall.”  “Thank you so much. You’re so sweet.” Mrs. Verlice gave you a look clearly not pleased with such false accusations.  “Have you been painting?” She asked in a loud grumble typical for elderly people with bad hearing and vocal fry from cigarettes.  “I was actually just about to paint” you revealed deciding in that moment that it was going to be the only thing intense enough to distract you from your emotions.  “Let me see more of ‘em sometime. I look at Podge everyday. He looks down at me from the spice shelf every morning.” Her words brought an affectionate smile to your face that threatened to form into a sad frown. You had painted a portrait of the Verlices’ late Labrador Podge a couple of weeks before to honor his passing the thought of your art bringing joy to Mrs. Verlice warming up your heart.  “That’s a good place for him to watch the dinner table from” you noted with a small chuckle blinking your eyes rapidly to dry up your tears when Mrs. Verlice wasn’t looking at you your current chaos of an emotional state heightening your sensitivity. “He was a good boy.” She looked down at the floor her shoe brushing over the doormat as you both stood in silence weighed down by the sad memory of Podge’s passing.  “Yeah he was. Anyways enjoy the cookies. Go create something. I’ll see you in the hallway” she said suddenly turning around and leaving you alone with a plate of snickerdoodles and a rogue tear that slid down your cheek.  You wiped your eyes dry kicking the door shut behind you as you pulled off the bread cloth to smell the freshly baked cookies. They made you feel a little bit better although they weren’t enough to make your sorrows disappear. You continued to fight your tears throughout the night wrapped in a fuzzy blanket in front of your easel one hand stuffing cookies down your throat the other placing carefully calculated strokes of oil paint on a large canvas as if slowly carving out the shapes of the trees in your landscape the autumn leaves matching the ones that you had seen in Washington Square Park. The painting resembled the scenery a little too much your heart aching whenever you recalled your first kiss with Natasha beneath those perfectly arching trees. It hadn’t been your intention to paint anything related to her or women or even people but your subconscious mind had clearly found a different route the painting linked to Natasha whether you wanted it or not.  You wiped your brush clean on the bit of paper towel that you had placed on a table you were sitting next to picking up a brighter shade of orange a shade that reminded you of her gorgeous sun-lit curls. You shut your eyes swallowing down the sob that threatened to push up your throat as you recalled what it was like to be kissed by her what it was like to be engulfed by her scent her presence her touch. Your brush halted against the wooden palette a quiet sniffle escaping you as your lower lip picked up a steady tremble. You didn’t want to cry. You didn’t want to be pathetic and cry over a woman you had kissed once over a woman you barely knew over a woman who was rapidly tearing your heart in two. With a quiet huff of determination you opened your glossy eyes and focused back on your palette your eyes going over the various shades of oranges yellows and browns that blended together in your blurry vision. You wiped your eyes on the corner of your blanket grabbing another chewy snickerdoodle that might have been slightly undercooked taking a bite of the cookie the cinnamon-sugar coating sticking to your lips. You shifted your attention fully on the fall scenery you were working on the sunset-painted sky all too cheery for your glum mood. You started mixing a vibrant gray that was a perfect blend of ultramarine cadmium red and lemon yellow the shade leaning toward muted purple. You saw each color shine through the blend your trained eye recognizing where the shade turned warmer and where it cooled down. You took another deep breath staring vehemently at the vermillion leaves the burnt umber of the tree trunks and the sienna of the leaf-covered ground your large paint brush moving to the lighter shades of the sky marring it with one long stroke of gray. You needed the painting to match your sadness you needed it to be a reflection of your pain because it had started out as an image of your joy that had now been ripped away from you with one single act of omission.  You made sure that the paint layer covered every single happy cloud that had once existed and replaced it with the deep gray that was about to become your signature color if Natasha didn’t get her act together and respond to your text as soon as humanly possible. Natasha. Natasha. You shouldn’t have let yourself think about her. You shouldn’t have… Your eyes filled with tears again. Suddenly the stretched fabric of the canvas looked undeniably punchable. Maybe you should have painted another portrait of her just so you could have decked her ass in a tangible way instead of just screaming at her inside your messy mind. She had been too good to be true. She had been too perfect too all-consuming. That kind of love didn’t exist in the real world. It only existed in fairytales and movies where people could live out their dreams and escape the destructive grip of reality. She had been nothing but an apparition visiting you from your fantasies.  There was another knock at your door a weak tap that was telling of who was behind your door again Mrs. Verlice’s arthritis preventing her from banging the door down like she probably would have wished to do. You were mildly thankful that there was a new distraction for you to deal with as you stood up and wiped your eyes again heading for the door. You unlocked it expecting to receive another plateful of baked goods but instead your gaze met a messy heap of red curls and an apologetic smile.  “I would love to go for dinner” Natasha said as if she had fought the world to get to you just to tell you that a weary smile on her face. She was beaten down the left side of her face decorated by trails of crimson blood her skin tainted by dirt and more dried blood. She seemed tired injured as she stood there at your doorstep leaning to the left in an uncomfortable manner as if her hip or ribs had taken a beating.  “Natasha” you gasped in shock your hands reaching for her in an instant to support her afraid that she might just collapse right there in front of you.  “Hey krasotka.” Clearly her wit was still intact. She offered you that little smirk that you loved so the expression morphing into one of discomfort as she shifted her weight onto her other foot.  “Krasotka?” You had to ask. You couldn’t stay in oblivion forever.  “Pretty girl” she whispered smiling in satisfaction at the look of awe on your face. Your cheeks warmed up as you realized how many times she had used that same moniker for you. All that time she had been calling you beautiful to your face but you didn’t have the time to get fixated on details you had an injured woman in need of care right in front of you mind you your woman. She was right there and she was hurt your protective side kicking in with force.  “What happened to you?” You asked in worry gently pulling her inside your apartment. “Who did this?”  “Oh you know work.” She huffed out the words as if there was nothing out of the ordinary about her condition. You thought back on the bruises you had seen on her knuckles the day before.  “Love what the hell are you doing here? You should be in the ER” you said with mild scorn as you walked her inside your foot nudging the door shut behind you. Natasha turned to look at you those normally intense eyes suddenly flashing momentarily with something vulnerable like your words the endearment was a confirmation of some sorts.  “I didn’t get to respond to your text” she muttered as if you were overreacting to her condition. You brought her to your small dining table by a large window in your kitchen the warm glow of the streetlights illuminating her briefly until you turned the kitchen lights on.  “Sit down” you ordered Natasha giving you a look of defiance.  “It’s not that bad. I’m f-”  “Sit. Down.” You ordered firmly standing right in front of her waiting for her to obey. Natasha looked at you for a moment but eventually seated herself on the chair quietly groaning when a sharp wave of pain went through her. You moved to the side to grab an emergency kit from the depths of your cupboards intent on fixing her up.  “What happened? Did you get mugged?” You asked her as you opened up the kit spreading its contents on the kitchen table. You had no clue what to do with it or how to treat her but at least you were properly prepared.  “Mugged.” She chuckled. Natasha didn’t get mugged. She might have mugged someone else but no one was going to mug Natasha. “No. It’s nothing dorogaya I told you. It’s just work.”  “Work? What do you do for work?” You could see that she sensed the air of anger around you she could see the glossiness of your eyes. She knew that you were hurt.  “Ever heard of the Avengers?” You looked at her blankly very far from amused frustrated that she was dodging your questions after showing up at your door with visible injuries and refusing to cue you in.  “Not funny.”  “I wasn’t trying to be.” You held her gaze your eyes widening slowly. You weren’t someone to follow politics very intently nor were you that interested in local or global news. You knew who the Avengers were you didn’t live under a rock but you would have never realized to make the connection on your own. The Avengers were on the news they lived a different life than the average person. They were out of the reach of your kind unattainable far far away. “Natasha Romanoff.” She offered her hand to you introducing herself officially but you just stared at her unable to grasp her hand grasp the statement behind her words. Your eyes dipped down her uniform that you were only then registering slowly taking in the leather combat suit that hugged her body snuggly nylon straps fastened around her thighs to carry her guns. Natasha Romanoff. The Natasha Romanoff was sitting in your kitchen bloody and beaten a twinge of betrayal squeezing your chest for the lies she had told. You had fallen in love with Natalia Nazarova sometimes called Natasha Nazarova not Natasha Romanoff the infamous Russian spy and a member of the Avengers. You had fallen in love with a lie but the feeling dissipated soon after when your eyes trailed back up to her face to see her angelic features marred by blood. She was still the same person at least for the most part. She was still your model your Natasha the woman you had kissed the woman you had pined after for weeks on end. She was still somewhere there. You grasped her hand.  “Y/N Y/L/N.” Natasha gave you a small smile a look of relief on her features as she gave your hand a small squeeze. You returned the gesture your attention shifting to the emergency kit. “Where does it hurt?”  “It doesn’t hurt.”  “Uh-huh right.” You nodded indifferently pouring antiseptic onto a cotton pad to clean up the side of her face where the blood was the most concentrated. You stood above her tilting her head back to give you a better visual.  “I don’t need-” She tried to move away pulling her head away from your hand but you didn’t let her get far your other hand sliding to the back of her head fingers gripping her hair to keep her still.  “I don’t care” you countered immediately leaving her no room to defy you as you gently patted the cotton over the damp wound watching how the stark white material was quickly stained red. When she realized that there was no getting rid of you and your caring hands she spread her knees enough to allow you to step between them and take a closer look at her wounds. Her eyes wandered down your body as she obediently waited for you to clean the laceration on her temple her attention shifting to your baggy pajama pants the material hanging low on your hips giving her just a peek of the waistband of your underwear her eyes lingering on the sliver of soft skin that had been left bare by your long sleeve shirt. Her hand brushed up your outer thigh in a casual manner a slight smirk flashing across her features. If you were going to order her around then it was only fair that she would have her own share of the fun. The smile returned when she noted the flustered look on your face your body moving closer to her chasing the feel of her hand.  “How’d you get this?” You needed a distraction from the heat that her touch elicited in you your mind struggling to comprehend what it meant that she was there in your apartment just a few feet away from your bedroom. The thought was followed by a reevaluation of your character. The woman was injured. It was not the time to be thinking about anything of the sort.  “Didn’t dodge fast enough and he had a knife” she replied nonchalantly allowing her fingers to stroke up and down your thigh idly a very prominent swarm of butterflies filling your stomach in a sudden burst. You were rather positive that if you had just opened your mouth a couple of the butterflies would have escaped you to explore the wonders that your kitchen had to offer.  “Was there more than one man?” You loosened your grip on her hair sinking your fingers into her thick locks gently caressing the back of her head as you finally found the source of the bleeding wiping away dirt from the cut on her temple.  “Yeah. There was an issue with the communication system and backup came a bit late” she explained her eyes shifting up to your face. She held your gaze with that same unabashed consistency that she had possessed since the moment you had seen her those eyes studying your reaction to the given information. You felt a frown on your face your hand pulling her closer almost subconsciously.  “I’m glad you’re okay” you whispered your hand halting and moving away from her face so that you could look at her properly. You offered her a shy smile feeling yourself lose the mild edge you had had on her. You could never seriously defy her not when a single look from her was enough to make you lose your composure.  “It’s a good thing I’ve got a sweet girl like you to make sure of that.” Your cheeks heated your shy smile widening into a pleased grin.  “You can shower here. I’ve got clean clothes for you if you wanna get more comfortable. I got food and tea or coffee if you want. Or if you’d prefer something stronger I’ve got that too” you offered kindly giving her a small smirk although it was less of an offer and more of a plea for her to stay.  “I’d really like that thank you detka.” She started to get up from the chair once you backed away a bit to give her more space your helping hands supporting her forearms to minimize the pain she was in.  “You’re not injured severely elsewhere are you?” You asked in mild concern eyeing her middle that seemed to be slightly hunched in on itself in the manner of a wounded animal.  “No just a bit of bruising.” You looked up at her tentatively refusing to back away from her as she stood mere inches away from you your dominant hand moving to her left side gently pressing over the curve of her waist. She failed to control the wince that took over her features momentarily as a jolt of pain went through her.  “Natasha” you said pleadingly pulling your hand away to avoid causing her any more pain.  “I’m okay” she assured you her partly gloved hand coming up to cup your cheek. You looked up at her fighting the tears that threatened to return from the shock you had experienced that night her thumb stroking over your skin delicately. She gave you a small smile her features softening when she saw your eyes gloss over. Even when beaten down Natasha had an air of security around her that made you want to fall into her arms as you stood there in front of her staring up at her like a small child in need of her love.  “Okay.” You nodded your head gently stepping to the side to allow her to move more freely. She let go of your cheek taking a step toward what she assumed was either your room or the bathroom. “The bathroom is on the right. You can go in and take your clothes off… you know to shower and stuff” you said awkwardly stumbling over your words when you realized what you’d said swiftly busying yourself with the emergency kit to have something else to focus on than the fact that she was going to be nude in your shower.  “Thank you krasotka” she grunted as she walked toward the door you had instructed her to go through her hand holding her ribs discreetly as if you couldn’t see that she was in pain.  “There are towels in the sink cabinet for you” you added hastily before she got the chance to disappear out of your sight. She thanked you again before closing the door behind her.  Holy lesbian fantasy. You sat down on the kitchen chair she had just occupied looking around your apartment in utter shock. You heard some rustling from the bathroom as Natasha got undressed your lewd mind jumping in at the very first opportunity for you to start creating unnecessarily detailed and dirty daydreams. She was injured. You stood up finding something else to do instead. You went to your kitchen cupboards digging out a mug for her finding her one with a pattern of hearts and a big heart smack in the middle of its bottom. You looked at it for a moment your eyes stuck on the dark red hearts. Could you have been any more obvious? You put the mug back on the shelf choosing another one in the shape of a jack o’lantern. It was beyond cute but for some reason it didn’t feel right. It didn’t exactly fit her personality. It was also worth noting that your own mug that sat beside your easel in your room was a part of a ceramics set you had made years ago its exterior decorated with miniature paintings of dogs of all sorts. You dug out its partner a similar mug painted with cats figuring that it suited her the best out of your narrow collection of mugs. She seemed like a cat person with her mysterious slippery aura and you wanted matching mugs no matter how you tried to deny it.  You decided to make her some tea deeming that it was the most comforting of the three options you had given her so while the kettle was heating up you headed into your bedroom to find clothes for her. You stared at your closet with a small frown on your face your hands on your hips as you contemplated your options. What would she want to wear? You’d never seen her in loungewear. Was she a sweats kind of woman or a leggings kind? Or maybe she preferred shorts… You preferred her naked. You groaned at your train of thought moving closer to the drawers and shelves that carried your cozier apparel. You pulled out a pair of straight-fitting trousers that were made of soft thin fabric that was more than comfortable. You paired it with a thick knit sweater that would go wonderfully with her auburn locks. You barely ever wore the sweater because its off-white shade didn’t suit you for some reason you couldn’t understand. It was a shame really because you loved the plaited sweater but you could never pull it off. Thankfully you now had someone who you knew was going to wear it the way it deserved to be worn. You found her pink fluffy socks to finalize the outfit smirking to yourself as you imagined her in the fuzzy socks the pleased expression changing drastically when your eyes wandered to look around your room. You noted every misplaced item and the laundry on your floor your eyes widening at the mess that your bedding was. You had no other option than to tidy up your room as best as you could. You made your bed in a hurry before the tea water was done boiling shoving all your laundry in the laundry basket to hide it making sure all the surfaces were free of unnecessary clutter to make the space look more organized. Finally you placed each item of clothing that you had chosen for her on your bed folding them up nicely before returning into the kitchen.  Food. Surely she would need food. She had been fighting evil people for who knew how long. You stared at your empty fridge: a jar of jam butter and a possibly moldy cucumber. You moved to the bread box opening it up to find a single slice of toast. Great. You grabbed it nonetheless chucking it into the toaster as you pulled out a jar of peanut butter retrieving the jam from the fridge. By the time your sad meal was ready you heard the shower turn off the door to the bathroom opening a few seconds later. Suddenly you felt more than awkward your eyes snapping away from her figure as she slipped back into the hallway with a towel around her.  “I picked out clothes for you. They’re on the bed but feel free to grab something else from my closet if you want” you said loudly refusing to turn around because you didn’t want her to see just how flustered you were by the sole thought of her in your bedroom.  “I’m sure whatever you picked out works just fine” she said with a soft chuckle as she entered your room. She halted by the door slowly taking in the atmosphere of your bedroom her eyes darting around to register every little detail of your personality that it had to offer. There were colors patterns objects that all felt so you that Natasha couldn’t help but fall in love with your room in that instance. It was a true embodiment of you as a person the art hanging on the walls immediately attracting her attention her gaze eventually shifting to the unfinished painting on the easel. There were so many little things for her to look at pictures books perfume bottles candles jewelry. She was faced with such an accurate display of your personality that it made her want to be consumed by your home consumed by you. Even the smell of your bedroom was enough to stir up something within her. She wanted more of it. She wanted the source of it. She wanted you.  She entered the room fully dropping her towel as she reached for the clothes you had picked out for her. She smiled to herself pulling them on to escape the chilly air of your apartment. She dressed herself up from head to toe hearing a knock at the door just as she was pulling on the soft pink socks. She gave you the permission to enter an amused smile on her face. It wasn’t like you would have seen anything new had she still been undressed.  “Hi I brought you a snack. I’m sure you’re hungry from fighting the bad guys and stuff. I didn’t really have much but we can order in” you explained as you entered the room with a single toasted peanut butter and jelly paired with a couple snickerdoodles and her tea. Her features softened at your kind gesture. “You can get comfortable and lay down whatever you want. You’re probably really tired.”  “I’m okay honey” she assured you in amusement your eyes finding her shower-fresh face that was still decorated with some bruising and scratches but she looked notably better without the dried blood.  “Are you sure you don’t need stitches or something? I can try.” Natasha chuckled quietly her heart warmed by your offer.  “Yes I’m sure. Now come here and sit down. You’ve done enough” she said gently patting the edge of the bed where she sat. You handed her the steaming tea setting her toast on the bedside table. She smelled like you. It was the first thing you noticed when you sat by her side. She smelled like you her hair her clothes her skin all of it smelled like you. She took a sip of the tea a smile finding her face when she saw the peanut butter toast. “How’d you know I like peanut butter and jelly?” She asked playfully setting her mug down moving to lean against the headboard when she noticed that her bruised ribs were too weak to support her. As if tuned into the very smallest details of her demeanor you moved to help her your hand finding a blanket from the end of the bed.  “Doesn’t everyone?” She smirked at your reply your hands covering her legs with the blanket. “It can get really cold in here” you mumbled as an explanation tucking her in. Natasha gave you a pleading look.  “Baby it’s okay. Everything is okay. You can slow down” she assured you gently her hand grasping yours that was still adjusting the blanket. Your eyes snapped up to meet her gaze the endearment falling so naturally from her lips that it made your heart hack in your chest. The tension in the room was palpable her warm hand sending a spark through your body as you allowed her to tug you to sit beside her against the headboard. “Here have a snickerdoodle with me.” Her smile was gentle the comforting energy that always surrounded her wearing off on you slowly allowing you to relax. She offered you a cookie from the plate both of you sitting in silence mouths occupied by the sugary treats.        A/N: We are finally getting somewhere,2024-10-28 20:08:53 GMT

Normally you took pride in completing your missions without collateral damage but the exhaustion was too much for today leaving you indifferent to the wreckage around you.  Every part of you ached and standing felt like an impossible task. Fury had been relentless with the assignments lately barely allowing you a moment to catch your breath and heal. When you tried to bring it up with him he simply shrugged you off. “If you can’t handle it maybe you don’t belong here.”  His words struck deep. You had given everything to prove yourself to him and now that dedication felt like a burden rather than a badge of honor.  His words struck deep. You had given everything to prove yourself to him and now that dedication felt like a burden rather than a badge of honor.  You usually took on the missions with your girlfriend Natasha. But this time she was overseas deep undercover and due to return in a few days. All you wanted was to clean up and heal your bruises before she came back so she wouldn’t have to worry about you.  Her absence left a hollow ache in your chest and you longed for the comfort of her presence as you finally stood up with a grunt. Walking back home didn’t sound good but you didn’t really have another choice so you suck it up and push through the pain.  After a long walk you finally reach home and lean against the elevator frame waiting for the doors to open. When they do you stumble inside and press the button for the 8th floor sinking to the ground and closing your eyes for a moment.  Just as the elevator stopped you heard a familiar voice. “Love? What are you doing down there? Are you okay?” You opened your eyes to find Wanda crouched in front of you concern etched across her face.  “Nat? What are you doing here? I thought you were coming back in a few days” you asked surprised.  “Surprise” she replied though her worried expression lingered.  “Let’s get you up. Come on” she said sliding your arm around her shoulder for support. You winced at the movement but leaned into her grateful for her presence.  “what happened?” she asks as she opens the front door and closes it with a flick of her hand as soon as you both walk in.  “Nothing I just came back from a mission” you grunt out as she helps you sit down on your bed.  Natasha’s eyes scan over your battered form her brow furrowing with concern. “Just a mission? You look like you’ve been through a war.” Her hands gently cup your face her thumbs stroking your cheeks. “Tell me what happened.”  You sigh the weight of your exhaustion pressing down on you. “Fury’s been… relentless lately. I’ve barely had time to breathe between assignments.”  Natasha’s expression darkens. “He’s pushing you too hard. This isn’t right.”  As she helps you remove your gear you wince at every movement. Natasha notices and her concern deepens. “You’re hurt. Let me help.”  “I’m fine I just need to lay down.” you refuse not wanting her to see the rest of your body.  “c’mon darling you know I can’t leave you like this” she cups your face “let me help. I’ll bandage the wounds at least.” she tugged your shirt upwards you didn’t have the energy left to argue so you just raise your arms as she gently takes off your shirt.  “This is what you call ‘nothing’?” Her voice is soft but tinged with anger.  “You’re taking the week off. I’ll have a word with Fury myself” she says her jaw set. She grabs a first aid kit and kneels in front of you her movements steady and careful as she begins cleaning your wounds her expression hurting you more than any other wound. Seeing her worried— for you just didn’t feel right.  “Nat I’m fine. I just need a day’s rest” you try to reassure her but the worry etched on her face doesn’t ease. She pauses then rests her head on your lap her arms wrapped around your waist. “I hate seeing you hurt” she whispers her voice barely audible.  Despite the pain you gently place a hand on her head brushing your fingers through her soft scarlet hair. “I’ll be okay really” you murmur lifting her face to meet your gaze before pressing a light kiss to her lips. The effort sends a wave of pain through you and you wince.  “Don’t move” she says quickly regaining her composure as she resumes bandaging you with even greater care. When she’s done she helps you into bed then disappears into the kitchen returning with a pill and a glass of water.  “Here this should help.” She hands you a painkiller her expression softened.  “Thank you love” you say swallowing the pill with a grateful smile. She leans in pressing a quick kiss to your forehead. She lays down next to you her movements still careful afraid of causing you pain. “I don’t feel like sleeping” you murmur turning to face her as she plants soft kisses on your hand.  “Would you like me to cook something for you?” she offers her green eyes brimming with concern and love—all for you. You can’t help but wonder how someone as perfect as she is could have chosen you. She notices you drifting off to your thoughts and gives you a quick peck to bring you back But instead of letting her pull away you slip a hand to the back of her neck and deepen the kiss savoring the warmth and connection you’ve missed so much.  “In the mood are we?” she teases her voice low and amused a playful spark lighting up her face.  “Maybe” you reply with a smirk. “I mean my girlfriend has been gone for a month.” You try to play it off ignoring the dull ache that’s settled into your muscles.  She chuckles tracing a finger down your cheek before resting her hand gently on your shoulder. “I’m sure we can make up for lost time“ she says laughter dancing in her tone &quot;but not today.”  &quot;Why not?” You blink half confused half pouting as she quirks an eyebrow.  “Do I need to remind you that just half an hour ago you could barely walk from the pain?” she says her eyebrow raised in playful challenge. in response you get on top of her holding back a grunt from the pain. you look her in the eyes as you cup her face in your hands “you’re making it really hard to refuse you right now” she whispers “that’s the plan” you whisper back in her ear before kissing her again.  She kisses you back but notices the little flinch of pain. “lay back down” she says through the kiss and you obey. “The pain gets even a little worse you tell me. okay?” she pulls away to look at you. You hum in response grabbing her face and pulling her back down for the kiss feeling impatient. you feel her knee in between your legs causing you to groan into the kiss.  “up” was all she needed to say before you sat up the pleasure of the moment covering any pain you felt. she leaned on the bed frame placing you on top of her thigh as she pulled you back into the kiss. the heat between your legs was increasing yearning for more causing you to grind on her thigh.  she takes off your shirt softly so as to not hurt you landing wet kisses across your body on your bruises cuts and scars.  you speed up riding her thigh while resting your head on her shoulder out of exhaustion. Nat traces your nipples with her fingers bringing her mouth down. brushing soft kisses before roughly sucking them off causing you to make sounds that are sinful to listen to.  You desperately start speeding up “Nat” You moan breathlessly voice coiled at your throat and your hands on her hair. She looks up at you suddenly stopping and softly turning you and laying you down on the bed as she travelled down your stomach. your legs parted— for her as she took off your pants along with your panties.  “You’re so beautiful” she pants before landing wet kisses on your pussy tauntingly. making you flinch. “Please” You raise your hips in an attempt to get what you’re yearning for but she quickly guides them back down. “Patience Darling.”.  She spreads your lips licking the wetness making you flinch before slowly entering her tongue in your cunt. you whimper out in pleasure but she barely gives you any time before speeding up causing you to clutch whatever you can. you bring your hands down on her hair tugging her deeper and deeper as you cry out in satisfaction.  “God…it feels good” you whine out in pleasure before your insides clench around her tongue finally giving you the sweet release. she rises licking her lips “My name’s not god Sweetheart.”  As Natasha wraps her arms around your waist pulling you close her warm breath tickles your ear as she asks “What are you thinking about?”  You smile recalling a cozy evening from not long ago. “Just thinking of those cookies you made last month” you murmur turning your head to meet her gaze with a playful glint in your eye.  She raises an eyebrow a mischievous smirk tugging at her lips. “Oh? You liked them that much?”  “Maybe…” you tease nudging her gently. Her smirk widens and she lets out a soft chuckle. “Well if it’s cookies you want…”  With a gentle kiss she pulls away her hand brushing down your arm before she stands up. “Consider it done” she says her voice laced with determination. As she pads toward the kitchen A smile tugs at your lips as you watch her disappear into the kitchen. Just moments ago she’d had you gasping and whispering her name in ways that felt sinful—and now here she is slipping out of bed to bake cookies.,2024-10-28 21:14:09 GMT
